0	4640	But what do we do? We say, we use Islam to say, oh, parents have all the rights.
5680	12160	And children have? None of the rights. By the way, the only relationship where one has all the rights
12160	17520	and the other has no rights is Allah and the slave. Because Allah has all the rights and we are just
18240	22320	slaves of Allah. We don't have any rights against Allah. Everything Allah gives us is a favor from Him.
22480	33040	But then the Quran teaches you and teaches me how is that an ayah? How is the wind an ayah?
34000	39760	How is the sun an ayah? Without it, I could learn a lot about the sun in science class,
39760	45680	but I won't learn that it is what? It's an ayah. The Quran came and changed the world around me
45680	53120	and I started seeing ayat everywhere. And the more ayat I see in the world, it takes me back to what
53120	59440	he teaches me about those ayat. And the more I read the Quran, it makes me go back into the universe
59440	64880	and explore those ayat. So those ayat pulled me back towards these ayat and these ayat pushed me
64880	70640	back towards those ayat and they keep going between the ayat. So when the Prophet ï·º is
70640	75200	reciting the ayat to them, he's changing their worldview. People now recognize that ayat are
75280	80320	all around them. So it's a very powerful phrase that's used as the opening statement of these four
80320	85600	steps. Now we're going to talk about the second step. We'll use that key here. Let me purify this.
87200	94960	The word Zaki comes from the letters Zakaaf and Waal. And it actually means either means an even
94960	104880	number, so a balance of numbers or two odd numbers together. When a land has no bugs and you can grow
104880	111520	really good plants on it, it's healthy soil, it's called Ardun Zakiya or Sabina, meaning it grows
111520	120160	really good fruits. Growth itself, like a child growing, is also called Zakaaf. So you know like
120160	128240	in Surat Al-Kahaf you have, did you kill a boy? Zakiya could mean pure, but it also means a growing
128240	134320	boy. Like he's not grown yet. He's still on his process of growing. So he's innocent, he's pure,
134320	141520	but he's also growing. So as Zakaaf, what we use in our Suriyah, like you have to pay Zakaaf every
141520	146880	year, right? So the Zakaaf means it purifies your money, but it actually also means it grows your money.
148320	152560	Right? Because when you give it, it puts more baraka in the rest of your money and that grows,
152560	157280	right? So and of course you're growing because whatever you spent, you've actually given to
157280	161920	your own self for the Akhira account. You just transfer from Dhuniya account to Akhira account.
161920	169040	So it's growth all around. Zakaaf is used as a verb, the verb Tasqiyah was used in Arabic
169040	175840	for two things. To fix something, like if you fixed your car, then you did Tasqiyah of your car
175840	181760	and also means to clean up something, to purify something. And oftentimes fixing something actually
181760	186880	requires the first step of it is what? Cleaning up. Like for example, if doctors are trying to fix
186880	192720	a cut or an injury, what's the first thing they do? They disinfect, right? They clean up all the mess
192720	199120	and then they fix. If somebody's trying to fix a beat up old car that's rusty, what's the first step?
199120	203600	They're going to clean up all the rust, get rid of that, then begin the fixing process, right?
203600	209840	So the same way Zakaaf actually means to fix, where the first step is actually cleansing or
209840	215120	purifying. Okay, now we get to the heart of the matter. The second step that is being described
215120	220800	is that he purifies them. He purifies them. And usually what we think of somebody being purified,
220800	225280	we think in the spiritual sense. But I want you to take the full picture. What does it mean
225280	231200	that the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, and the Qur'an is purifying them, right? The
231200	235840	messengers purifying these people. Firstly, yes, it is spiritually purifying them, meaning they
235840	243280	believed in multiple gods. They didn't realize the damage their sins do to their souls, their hearts.
243280	248640	They didn't realize that. So there is a spiritual cleansing. There's a spiritual purification
248640	253760	that's happening. By the way, when we see Tezquia or purification, you should also think of
253760	259200	nurturing and cleansing, because those meanings are growth, nurturing, and cleansing, all of them.
259200	264400	So you know what that means? People are being spiritually developed. They're not just becoming
264400	268960	pure overnight. They're being nurtured and developed, right? You're not there yet. You're
268960	273520	going to get there. Like for example, in some people, they have a really bad diet, and they
273520	277520	want to fix themselves. They want to get healthier. Then they go to a nutritionist or they go to a
277520	281440	fitness coach or something, and he says, okay, we're going to do a detox, or we're going to do
281440	284640	this program. And you're going to go on a keto diet, or you're going to go to this other kind of
284640	291680	adab diet or whatever they come up with, right? So what are they doing? Do you get cleansed overnight?
292560	296960	No. And is it sometimes you're in the process of cleansing and you're like, I see a donut. I
296960	303040	don't know what to do. And then you go back and you dirty yourself again. So you make progress,
303040	306480	then you fall, and you make progress, and you fall, you make progress, and you fall. Overall,
306480	310400	you should be making progress, but it's not like every day is progress. Sometimes there's dips,
310960	316960	right? Some days are not as good as other days. But overall, you're developing. And actually,
316960	320960	falling is also a lesson. And then you learn from that lesson, and you develop again, and you keep
320960	324640	taking more and more steps towards furthering. So that's spiritual development. And that's
324640	329440	actually something that many in the Islamic tradition, we've talked a lot about purification of
329440	334480	the heart, right? And the cleansing of the heart. And Allah talks about that in the Qur'an quite a
334480	340880	bit. I have my own unorthodox view on spiritual purification. So I'll share that with you,
340880	344160	because I'm only here for a few days, and then you have to deal with the consequences yourself.
344720	354960	I do believe that what Allah revealed to us is right to the point. Like Allah does not speak in
354960	360560	circles. And Allah does not speak in abstract philosophy. Allah speaks directly. You know,
360560	364800	the shortest distance between two things is a straight line. When there's a problem, Allah
364800	370160	addresses the problem directly, right? So for example, Allah says, well, okay, how do you get,
370160	377120	people say, how do you get Taqwa of Allah? How do I get, Allah says, okay, start fasting and in
377120	383600	month of Ramadan. And what's, what's it going to give you? How's fasting going to give me Taqwa? Well,
383600	388080	you're going to learn to stay away from things that are even halal. And it's going to teach you
388080	395280	how to stop yourself. And Taqwa in the end is what? Stop yourself. So 30 days of stopping yourself
395280	400400	might help you build a little bit of an ability to stop yourself from doing stupid things, from
400400	405680	doing haram things. If you can even stop yourself from halal things, then maybe that's a pretty good
405680	411680	training for you to even stop from haram things, right? So that's, it's a, it's a step and it's
411680	416400	not guaranteed. La'allakum means hopefully you'll get some taqwa out of it. The hope is you'll get
416400	421600	taqwa out of it. Okay, well, how do I, how do I know if I have taqwa? He says,
421680	429520	be mindful of Allah and say things in a straightforward way. Just say, say exactly
429520	435360	what you mean. What happens sometimes when you need to talk to somebody? Do you say exactly what you
435360	441040	mean or do you calculate in your head if I say this, what's going to happen? Oh my God, I even hate
441040	446560	me so much. I can't tell him. I can't tell him. No, I need to be strategic about this. We have so
446640	453760	much fear of people that it overrides the fear of who? Riven, Allah says, if you have taqwa of me,
453760	459280	speak straightforward. It doesn't matter who you offend. It doesn't matter if you ended up siding
459280	463360	with the enemy because you're saying the right thing. It doesn't matter if you were going against
463360	467440	the loved one because you're siding with the right thing. Just say, if you're really fearful of me,
467440	471680	just say the right thing and then I will fix whatever situation there is. You'll sliha'lakum
472480	477760	Ma'amadakum. In other words, Allah does not give us some, oh, you must first climb on this mountain
477760	484800	and you must sit under a tree and until you feel the breeze, you will not know the truth of taqwa.
486480	491520	There's no, you know, like when people go to the sensei to learn kung fu and he says,
491520	495600	just go up and down the mountain 20 times and learn this breathing technique before I even begin to
495600	503360	teach you or wax on, wax off before you can, yeah. There's no complicated stuff. It's straightforward.
503920	510880	Taqwa is easy. You want to clean your heart? Easy. Don't do ri'ba. That complicated? Don't talk about
510880	516400	people. Don't slander people. Don't make fun of each other, right? Give people's money back.
517280	522160	Don't give people's money. If you owe people money, find nazaliqa min taqwa al-kulub.
523120	528480	But you know what? What sometimes happens, I don't know, blame the entire genre, but sometimes what happens is
529040	532480	the thing that you should do that's right in your face that the Qur'an is saying,
532480	535920	do this and you will be spiritually cleansed, that's too much work.
537520	541840	So I'm going to come up with some zikr that makes me feel so spiritually connected.
541840	546160	And when I read, when I listen to this nashid, oh my god, I feel like so close to Allah, I know what
546160	554960	to hide. And you come up with all these exotic ways of purifying your heart. And the thing that
554960	562640	he's saying, do this and you will be good of heart. Nah. No, no, no, I need something more exotic.
563840	570320	I need something more like exceptional, something so special that this mentor of mine,
570320	575040	who knows the secrets of the universe, apparently, he's going to tell me those secrets. Then I will
575040	580880	know how to cleanse my heart. This stuff, I believe, is what used to be the case before the coming of
580880	586320	the Qur'an. This thing that some people carry the secrets to cleanse your heart and nobody else knows
586320	591440	them. This was the mentality before Islam. This is what people that used to manipulate people in
591440	596720	the name of religion used to do. Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.
596720	600720	Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you that I want you to sign up for
600800	606880	bayinatv.com and help other sign up or even sponsor students for bayinatv.com so we can create worldwide
606880	610800	communities of students that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the Qur'an
611440	616720	and are insha'Allah, spreading that in their own circles. Thanks so much. And the Qur'an came to
616720	621920	get rid of all of this. But human beings have their own human tendencies. So what did they do over time?
622880	629280	They went back to the same tendencies again. And I don't dismiss the entire genre. And I actually
629280	634800	appreciate quite a bit across a variety of genres in Islamic studies, including Sufi literature.
634800	641840	However, did we develop extremes? Yeah. And are some of them extremely against the spirit of the
641840	648720	Qur'an? Absolutely. Absolutely. And if you just read, if you go back to Stepan, yatlu alayhim a'yati,
648720	655760	you'd be like, I need to distance myself from this, this version of spirituality that's actually
655760	662640	against the Qur'an's spirituality. It's not just cleansing me spiritually. It's cleansing my concept
662640	669520	of spirituality. It's actually purifying my, what does it mean to be a good person? You know, a young
669520	674160	lady asked the other day, I feel so bad that I don't fast on Mondays and Thursdays. Did Allah in
674160	678560	his entire Qur'an ask you to feel bad if you don't fast on Mondays and Thursdays? Didn't he free you
678560	683440	from that burden? There are some things you should feel bad about. And I'm pretty sure Allah, the
683440	689440	knower of the unseen and the seen who guided humanity until the end of time, with his most
689440	693920	perfect speech, would tell you, here are the things you should actually feel bad about.
695360	701360	Right? So didn't he liberate me from all the other guilt that I don't have to carry?
702320	708800	It's actually spiritually liberating. Then there's intellectual purification. Qur'an keeps saying
709040	715040	This isn't just a spiritual religion. It's an intellectual religion. Ibrahim
715040	720240	alaihi salam isn't just questioning his people spiritually. He's questioning them intellectually.
720240	725200	Saying, so why do you follow this? Why should I believe in this? What is the reason behind this?
725200	730480	There's this Qur'an keeps saying go ask questions, explore, go see the earth, travel,
731360	738400	ask those who ask the people who know if you don't know. Learn, inquire. What religion tells you to
738400	744400	leave the monastery and go explore? People, religions usually told you don't go out there,
744400	751280	you will lose your faith. Don't think for yourself, thinking from the devil. I've actually met some
751280	754960	folks that I talked to about God a little bit. I was like, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. But you
754960	759120	know, my pastor told me that if it makes too much sense, it's the devil trying to trick you.
761360	766880	As not just some denominations of Christianity that developed that many Muslims don't listen
766880	771760	because it's going to seem like it makes a lot of sense. That's how shaitan gets you by using your
771760	779040	brain. Stop thinking and you will be safe. Allah created the best of creation, the human being,
779040	784560	and the best of his muscles is in here. And you use this to come to Islam. And after you come to
784560	789040	Islam, you tell people, stop using this thing because now you're Muslim. Now you can be stupid.
790000	796960	The book came to cleanse us intellectually, to make us people of thought and exploration and learning.
796960	802640	You know, and this is an intellectual cleansing that's part of, and you know, what should I believe
802640	806480	about Allah? Why should I believe that about Allah? What should I believe about the Prophet's
806480	810480	life? You know, why should I believe that? What should I believe about my relationship with him?
810480	815440	These are intellectual purifications. And then there's a physical purification. Like what? Give me an
816160	823840	example of physical purification in this religion. And actually even what we eat, what we put inside
823840	829200	our body has to be good and pure, isn't it? So the body on the external needs to be pure and also
829200	835680	physically, internally also needs to be pure. And the physical relationships we have with other
835680	843120	human beings, the spouses, has to be pure. All of it has to be pure. So it's not just spiritually
844080	849200	intellectually cleansing, it's actually physically cleansing. And our physical cleanliness is tied
849200	854240	to our intellectual and our spiritual cleanliness. And one of my favorites is the Qur'an's emotional
854240	859600	purification. I loved, I alluded to it before, but I'll tell you some more about it. In Arab culture,
859600	864080	for example, if a husband and wife had an argument with each other and the husband got really mad at
864080	871600	his wife, it would say, I hate you so much from today on, when I think of you. It's like I think
871600	882320	of my own mother. From today, you are my mother. And she'd be like, this is called the Har. This
882320	887200	was a practice called the Har. The Arabs used to do this. And that means forever again, I will never
887200	890960	be with this woman again. I will never think about her romantically again. I will never be in a
890960	897520	relationship with her again, because she is now equal to who? My mother. So it's disgusting now for
897520	900800	me. Allah says in the Qur'an,
905440	909120	All those people who do this with their women, they're not their moms.
911440	918800	Done. I can't believe he said I'm his mom. Allah said, no, they're not. You're not his mom.
919760	924080	You can say whatever you want. Some people are really into drama, right? They say dramatic things.
925040	927520	I mean, I come from South Asia. We're really into drama.
928960	933040	Right? Some moms will say to their son, from today, you are not my son.
935840	936640	I'm still your son.
939120	940880	There. Can't change that.
942960	947600	Fathers can say, if you do this again, you are no longer my son. Actually, I am.
948560	952880	Okay, the genetics are still. Yeah, I look like you dad. Look at me.
955120	959280	No, no, you can't change that. You can't emotionally blackmail people.
960080	965760	You can't use emotions to control people. Allah even said, you know, and if you I mentioned this
965760	969520	before, emotionally, people, you know, relationships are supposed to be healthy,
969520	974160	which means I have some rights and my wife has some rights. I have some rights. My parents have
974240	978960	some rights. I have some rights. My siblings have some rights. I have responsibilities. They also
978960	985360	have what? Responsibilities. It's a give and take as a balance between both. But what do we do?
985360	989040	We say we use Islam to say, Oh, parents have all the rights.
990080	996640	And children have none of the rights. By the way, the only relationship where one has all the rights
996640	1002000	and the other has no rights is Allah and the slave, because Allah has all the rights and we are just
1002720	1006640	slaves of Allah. We don't have any rights against Allah. Everything Allah gives us is a favor from
1006640	1014080	him. Every other relationship has what? Rights and responsibilities. You think of a mother
1014880	1020560	who doesn't feed her child and throws him out in the trash and goes to jail because of it. She says,
1020560	1025840	But in Islam, I have all the rights and that baby I threw in the trash should still treat me with
1026080	1029760	Ahsan when he grows up one day after he comes out of foster care.
1031520	1036880	You think she has that right? You think this is what Islam teaches? No. No, there's you have to
1036880	1043360	do your part. Even in the dua you make for your parents, for example, you say, My master, show them
1043360	1051120	both rahma, but you don't stop there. What do you say? Come on, the way they raised me when I was,
1051120	1055040	the way they nurtured me when I was small. But if they were beating you up when you were small,
1055040	1058880	if they were abusing you when you were small, if they were abandoning you when you were small,
1059520	1063280	if they were drinking alcohol and fighting each other and scarring you psychologically in front
1063280	1079280	of you when you were small, is that rabbiyaani? You know what that is? That's emotional cleansing.
1080000	1085520	Why? Because now the only emotionally you only carry the burdens Allah made you carry.
1086320	1090720	And you don't have to carry any burdens and any guilt that Allah did not make you carry.
1091440	1096240	There are some things emotionally also in our families and in our cultures. There are some
1096240	1101840	things that are wrong, but they're not wrong in Islam. You know that, right? There are some things
1101840	1108320	that are culturally very wrong, but they're not wrong in Islam. And when you do something that's
1108400	1113040	Allah has no problem with it. Completely halal. Allah has no problem with it. And you're doing the
1113040	1118240	right thing. And everyone in your family says, this is wrong. We hate you. We can't believe you
1118240	1123280	did this. You're such a shame. Allah will ask you, well, Allah is actually not having a problem at all.
1124160	1129200	You're having a problem. Allah has no problem. I'm well within my rights. I didn't violate
1129200	1135280	anybody's rights. I stayed within Allah's shade of halal. You know what Allah does? He removes
1135280	1142160	that emotional baggage. He cleanses my emotions. I don't have to carry those emotions with me.
1142160	1147600	I don't have to carry that guilt with me. If I owe real guilt, I owe it to someone who I actually
1147600	1152640	wronged according to the Book of Allah. If I actually wronged my parents, I owe that. If I
1152640	1158080	actually wrong some fine, I owe an apology. And the other incredible emotional cleansing that Allah
1158080	1162400	did is, how many times do you have to make daubat to Allah before Allah accepts the daubat? Tell me.
1165840	1172080	Sincere daubat, how many times? And then you have to believe that Allah has what?
1172960	1177120	Forgiven. You have to believe that. We learned that in the Qur'an. Of course,
1177120	1182000	you should keep making daubat because we make many sins. But if you sincerely, like for example,
1182000	1186960	you stole when you were a teenager, you were stupid and you ran away with somebody else's
1186960	1192880	McDonald's fries. You feel really guilty. Now, your next Ramadan, you decided to make daubat for
1192960	1199520	those fries. You were like, I remember I ate 18 fries. So I'm going to make 18 days of Ramadan,
1199520	1205200	18 different daubas. No, no, no. You could put the whole packet together and just make one daubat.
1205200	1210000	Sincerely. You can move on now. You don't have to live inside that guilt. You understand? You can
1210000	1215200	move on. Musa alayhi salam killed somebody and he made istighfar to Allah. But did he keep on
1215200	1219280	making istighfar to Allah? He made istighfar to Allah. That's it. Now he's doing good things. He's
1219280	1227120	moved on because he's hoping that Allah will now forgive. That's it. What do we do? Human beings.
1227120	1231840	Allah says, ask me sincerely once, inna illa haqfirudh lulu ba jami'a. What do human beings do?
1231840	1238080	Sorry I did that. That's not good enough for me. You know, you're not really sorry, right? Yes,
1238080	1245520	I am. I am sorry. I said I'm sorry. Did you though? And then the next time you're in a bad mood,
1245520	1250480	you remember what you did, right? But I said sorry for that. Yeah, you said sorry. You think that's
1250480	1257200	enough? But I didn't just say sorry. I asked you what can I do to make it up to you? And you said
1257200	1262000	this, this, and this, and I did this, this, and this, and you're bringing it up again? Yeah, well,
1262000	1269360	I can't let it go. Because I don't think you've paid enough of a price. I don't think Allah will
1269360	1275440	forgive you because I'm not happy. Oh, this is the last one I'm going to share with you on emotional
1275680	1282400	cleansing that Allah gave us in this book. You know, some people say until I forgive you,
1282400	1289840	I can guarantee you Allah will not forgive you. I love that one. I love that one. So until I
1289840	1296640	forgive you, what's going to happen? Allah will not forgive you. Ah, I see. So that means on
1296640	1301840	judgment day, doesn't matter how much snow by made, how much I corrected myself. If someone is still
1301840	1306960	mad at me in the world who says I don't forgive this guy, I don't forgive him before I'm about to
1306960	1315600	walk into jannah, he will say, Oh, hold on. I'm still upset. Angels, haul him into hell.
1317920	1324880	You think you and I control Allah's forgiveness? I'll give you just one example to put me and you
1324880	1330160	in our place, just to put us in our place. Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was in
1330400	1337200	Uhud and he got injured. He got hit. He fell unconscious. He wakes up from unconsciousness
1337760	1344400	and he says, how can Allah guide a people that spill its prophet's blood? He was upset with the
1344400	1353840	Quraysh who almost killed him. You know what Allah said to him? You have no authority. You don't
1353840	1359520	have no authority whatsoever. Or you are a slave to them or you are a slave to them.
1360720	1365840	Whether he forgives them, accepts their tawbah or he punishes them and they are in fact wrong.
1367920	1370000	Allah owns whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth.
1372160	1375280	He forgives whoever he wants and he punishes whoever he wants.
1376560	1379760	And Allah is forgiving. Allah is the loving and caring one. By the way,
1380800	1384640	who was the one person in the battle of Uhud that caused the prophet to bleed?
1384640	1388880	Actually, one person who turned the whole battle around. You know what that is?
1388960	1394240	His name is Khalid ibn Walid. He was the strategist who saw the Muslims are in a weak position.
1394240	1398960	We can come around, flank them from behind and that's when everything went bad for the Muslims.
1398960	1406800	What's his name? Did Allah forgive him? Did he become a Sahabi? The one who was the reason
1406800	1413360	for the prophet almost being killed. Right? Allah says he forgives whoever he wants. He punishes
1413360	1421600	whoever he wants. That's up to Allah. He can tell that to his prophet but you think you're going to
1421600	1427440	tell Allah that your cousin is not going to get forgiven because you're still mad. Whatever Allah
1427440	1432480	does with them, that's between Allah and him. You have your dealing with Allah and Allah says about
1432480	1438320	judgment. Allah will heal the hearts of believers. Yes, there may be somebody who's caused you pain
1438320	1442960	and you feel like they got away with it and maybe they'll just make tawbah. Thank you.
1443200	1447440	I like this better. These things make me sneeze more. I'll love the gesture.
1449280	1454320	At least I'm not sneezing so that's how happy I am about that because the amount of angels today.
1455040	1460160	Oh man. Okay. Anyway, so now let's move on to financial cleansing.
1462880	1467280	Here's what's coming up in the next episode and this deeper look of Surat al-Jumu'ah.
1468160	1475200	You know? Like for example, in many cultures you cannot get married until you have this much
1475200	1479680	degree, this much money. You've done this, this, this, this, and then maybe we'll think about getting
1480320	1484560	you married. And then once you are ready to get married, the mahat has to be this amount and this
1484560	1489280	amount and this amount. And then if you are going to get married, we have to have this kind of a hall
1490080	1496560	and this kind of catering and these kinds of gifts and there's like the bill keeps going higher and
1496560	1503840	higher and higher and higher. And what Allah did in Islam is he made the path to halal easy
1504400	1511360	and the path to haram difficult. And what many cultures do is they make the path to halal
1511360	1517200	extremely what? Difficult. And when you make the path to halal difficult automatically,
1517200	1523360	what becomes a lot easier? The haram becomes way easier. It's so much easier. You know?
