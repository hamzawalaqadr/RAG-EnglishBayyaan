1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
But what do we do? We say, we use Islam to say, oh, parents have all the rights.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,160
And children have? None of the rights. By the way, the only relationship where one has all the rights

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,520
and the other has no rights is Allah and the slave. Because Allah has all the rights and we are just

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
slaves of Allah. We don't have any rights against Allah. Everything Allah gives us is a favor from Him.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:33,040
But then the Quran teaches you and teaches me how is that an ayah? How is the wind an ayah?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,760
How is the sun an ayah? Without it, I could learn a lot about the sun in science class,

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,680
but I won't learn that it is what? It's an ayah. The Quran came and changed the world around me

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,120
and I started seeing ayat everywhere. And the more ayat I see in the world, it takes me back to what

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,440
he teaches me about those ayat. And the more I read the Quran, it makes me go back into the universe

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,880
and explore those ayat. So those ayat pulled me back towards these ayat and these ayat pushed me

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,640
back towards those ayat and they keep going between the ayat. So when the Prophet ï·º is

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,200
reciting the ayat to them, he's changing their worldview. People now recognize that ayat are

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,320
all around them. So it's a very powerful phrase that's used as the opening statement of these four

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,600
steps. Now we're going to talk about the second step. We'll use that key here. Let me purify this.

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,960
The word Zaki comes from the letters Zakaaf and Waal. And it actually means either means an even

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:44,880
number, so a balance of numbers or two odd numbers together. When a land has no bugs and you can grow

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,520
really good plants on it, it's healthy soil, it's called Ardun Zakiya or Sabina, meaning it grows

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:02:00,160
really good fruits. Growth itself, like a child growing, is also called Zakaaf. So you know like

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:08,240
in Surat Al-Kahaf you have, did you kill a boy? Zakiya could mean pure, but it also means a growing

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,320
boy. Like he's not grown yet. He's still on his process of growing. So he's innocent, he's pure,

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,520
but he's also growing. So as Zakaaf, what we use in our Suriyah, like you have to pay Zakaaf every

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,880
year, right? So the Zakaaf means it purifies your money, but it actually also means it grows your money.

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,560
Right? Because when you give it, it puts more baraka in the rest of your money and that grows,

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,280
right? So and of course you're growing because whatever you spent, you've actually given to

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,920
your own self for the Akhira account. You just transfer from Dhuniya account to Akhira account.

26
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:49,040
So it's growth all around. Zakaaf is used as a verb, the verb Tasqiyah was used in Arabic

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,840
for two things. To fix something, like if you fixed your car, then you did Tasqiyah of your car

28
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,760
and also means to clean up something, to purify something. And oftentimes fixing something actually

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,880
requires the first step of it is what? Cleaning up. Like for example, if doctors are trying to fix

30
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,720
a cut or an injury, what's the first thing they do? They disinfect, right? They clean up all the mess

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,120
and then they fix. If somebody's trying to fix a beat up old car that's rusty, what's the first step?

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,600
They're going to clean up all the rust, get rid of that, then begin the fixing process, right?

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,840
So the same way Zakaaf actually means to fix, where the first step is actually cleansing or

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,120
purifying. Okay, now we get to the heart of the matter. The second step that is being described

35
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,800
is that he purifies them. He purifies them. And usually what we think of somebody being purified,

36
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,280
we think in the spiritual sense. But I want you to take the full picture. What does it mean

37
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,200
that the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, and the Qur'an is purifying them, right? The

38
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,840
messengers purifying these people. Firstly, yes, it is spiritually purifying them, meaning they

39
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,280
believed in multiple gods. They didn't realize the damage their sins do to their souls, their hearts.

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,640
They didn't realize that. So there is a spiritual cleansing. There's a spiritual purification

41
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,760
that's happening. By the way, when we see Tezquia or purification, you should also think of

42
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,200
nurturing and cleansing, because those meanings are growth, nurturing, and cleansing, all of them.

43
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,400
So you know what that means? People are being spiritually developed. They're not just becoming

44
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,960
pure overnight. They're being nurtured and developed, right? You're not there yet. You're

45
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,520
going to get there. Like for example, in some people, they have a really bad diet, and they

46
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520
want to fix themselves. They want to get healthier. Then they go to a nutritionist or they go to a

47
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,440
fitness coach or something, and he says, okay, we're going to do a detox, or we're going to do

48
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,640
this program. And you're going to go on a keto diet, or you're going to go to this other kind of

49
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,680
adab diet or whatever they come up with, right? So what are they doing? Do you get cleansed overnight?

50
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,960
No. And is it sometimes you're in the process of cleansing and you're like, I see a donut. I

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,040
don't know what to do. And then you go back and you dirty yourself again. So you make progress,

52
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,480
then you fall, and you make progress, and you fall, you make progress, and you fall. Overall,

53
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,400
you should be making progress, but it's not like every day is progress. Sometimes there's dips,

54
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,960
right? Some days are not as good as other days. But overall, you're developing. And actually,

55
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,960
falling is also a lesson. And then you learn from that lesson, and you develop again, and you keep

56
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,640
taking more and more steps towards furthering. So that's spiritual development. And that's

57
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,440
actually something that many in the Islamic tradition, we've talked a lot about purification of

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,480
the heart, right? And the cleansing of the heart. And Allah talks about that in the Qur'an quite a

59
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,880
bit. I have my own unorthodox view on spiritual purification. So I'll share that with you,

60
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,160
because I'm only here for a few days, and then you have to deal with the consequences yourself.

61
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:54,960
I do believe that what Allah revealed to us is right to the point. Like Allah does not speak in

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,560
circles. And Allah does not speak in abstract philosophy. Allah speaks directly. You know,

63
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,800
the shortest distance between two things is a straight line. When there's a problem, Allah

64
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,160
addresses the problem directly, right? So for example, Allah says, well, okay, how do you get,

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,120
people say, how do you get Taqwa of Allah? How do I get, Allah says, okay, start fasting and in

66
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,600
month of Ramadan. And what's, what's it going to give you? How's fasting going to give me Taqwa? Well,

67
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
you're going to learn to stay away from things that are even halal. And it's going to teach you

68
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,280
how to stop yourself. And Taqwa in the end is what? Stop yourself. So 30 days of stopping yourself

69
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,400
might help you build a little bit of an ability to stop yourself from doing stupid things, from

70
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,680
doing haram things. If you can even stop yourself from halal things, then maybe that's a pretty good

71
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,680
training for you to even stop from haram things, right? So that's, it's a, it's a step and it's

72
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,400
not guaranteed. La'allakum means hopefully you'll get some taqwa out of it. The hope is you'll get

73
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,600
taqwa out of it. Okay, well, how do I, how do I know if I have taqwa? He says,

74
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:09,520
be mindful of Allah and say things in a straightforward way. Just say, say exactly

75
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,360
what you mean. What happens sometimes when you need to talk to somebody? Do you say exactly what you

76
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,040
mean or do you calculate in your head if I say this, what's going to happen? Oh my God, I even hate

77
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,560
me so much. I can't tell him. I can't tell him. No, I need to be strategic about this. We have so

78
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,760
much fear of people that it overrides the fear of who? Riven, Allah says, if you have taqwa of me,

79
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,280
speak straightforward. It doesn't matter who you offend. It doesn't matter if you ended up siding

80
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,360
with the enemy because you're saying the right thing. It doesn't matter if you were going against

81
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,440
the loved one because you're siding with the right thing. Just say, if you're really fearful of me,

82
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,680
just say the right thing and then I will fix whatever situation there is. You'll sliha'lakum

83
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,760
Ma'amadakum. In other words, Allah does not give us some, oh, you must first climb on this mountain

84
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,800
and you must sit under a tree and until you feel the breeze, you will not know the truth of taqwa.

85
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,520
There's no, you know, like when people go to the sensei to learn kung fu and he says,

86
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,600
just go up and down the mountain 20 times and learn this breathing technique before I even begin to

87
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:23,360
teach you or wax on, wax off before you can, yeah. There's no complicated stuff. It's straightforward.

88
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,880
Taqwa is easy. You want to clean your heart? Easy. Don't do ri'ba. That complicated? Don't talk about

89
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,400
people. Don't slander people. Don't make fun of each other, right? Give people's money back.

90
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,160
Don't give people's money. If you owe people money, find nazaliqa min taqwa al-kulub.

91
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,480
But you know what? What sometimes happens, I don't know, blame the entire genre, but sometimes what happens is

92
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,480
the thing that you should do that's right in your face that the Qur'an is saying,

93
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,920
do this and you will be spiritually cleansed, that's too much work.

94
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,840
So I'm going to come up with some zikr that makes me feel so spiritually connected.

95
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,160
And when I read, when I listen to this nashid, oh my god, I feel like so close to Allah, I know what

96
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:14,960
to hide. And you come up with all these exotic ways of purifying your heart. And the thing that

97
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,640
he's saying, do this and you will be good of heart. Nah. No, no, no, I need something more exotic.

98
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,320
I need something more like exceptional, something so special that this mentor of mine,

99
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,040
who knows the secrets of the universe, apparently, he's going to tell me those secrets. Then I will

100
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,880
know how to cleanse my heart. This stuff, I believe, is what used to be the case before the coming of

101
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,320
the Qur'an. This thing that some people carry the secrets to cleanse your heart and nobody else knows

102
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,440
them. This was the mentality before Islam. This is what people that used to manipulate people in

103
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,720
the name of religion used to do. Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.

104
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you that I want you to sign up for

105
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,880
bayinatv.com and help other sign up or even sponsor students for bayinatv.com so we can create worldwide

106
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,800
communities of students that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the Qur'an

107
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,720
and are insha'Allah, spreading that in their own circles. Thanks so much. And the Qur'an came to

108
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,920
get rid of all of this. But human beings have their own human tendencies. So what did they do over time?

109
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,280
They went back to the same tendencies again. And I don't dismiss the entire genre. And I actually

110
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,800
appreciate quite a bit across a variety of genres in Islamic studies, including Sufi literature.

111
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,840
However, did we develop extremes? Yeah. And are some of them extremely against the spirit of the

112
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:48,720
Qur'an? Absolutely. Absolutely. And if you just read, if you go back to Stepan, yatlu alayhim a'yati,

113
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,760
you'd be like, I need to distance myself from this, this version of spirituality that's actually

114
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,640
against the Qur'an's spirituality. It's not just cleansing me spiritually. It's cleansing my concept

115
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,520
of spirituality. It's actually purifying my, what does it mean to be a good person? You know, a young

116
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,160
lady asked the other day, I feel so bad that I don't fast on Mondays and Thursdays. Did Allah in

117
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,560
his entire Qur'an ask you to feel bad if you don't fast on Mondays and Thursdays? Didn't he free you

118
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,440
from that burden? There are some things you should feel bad about. And I'm pretty sure Allah, the

119
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,440
knower of the unseen and the seen who guided humanity until the end of time, with his most

120
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,920
perfect speech, would tell you, here are the things you should actually feel bad about.

121
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Right? So didn't he liberate me from all the other guilt that I don't have to carry?

122
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,800
It's actually spiritually liberating. Then there's intellectual purification. Qur'an keeps saying

123
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,040
This isn't just a spiritual religion. It's an intellectual religion. Ibrahim

124
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,240
alaihi salam isn't just questioning his people spiritually. He's questioning them intellectually.

125
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,200
Saying, so why do you follow this? Why should I believe in this? What is the reason behind this?

126
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,480
There's this Qur'an keeps saying go ask questions, explore, go see the earth, travel,

127
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,400
ask those who ask the people who know if you don't know. Learn, inquire. What religion tells you to

128
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,400
leave the monastery and go explore? People, religions usually told you don't go out there,

129
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:31,280
you will lose your faith. Don't think for yourself, thinking from the devil. I've actually met some

130
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,960
folks that I talked to about God a little bit. I was like, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. But you

131
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,120
know, my pastor told me that if it makes too much sense, it's the devil trying to trick you.

132
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,880
As not just some denominations of Christianity that developed that many Muslims don't listen

133
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,760
because it's going to seem like it makes a lot of sense. That's how shaitan gets you by using your

134
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:59,040
brain. Stop thinking and you will be safe. Allah created the best of creation, the human being,

135
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,560
and the best of his muscles is in here. And you use this to come to Islam. And after you come to

136
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,040
Islam, you tell people, stop using this thing because now you're Muslim. Now you can be stupid.

137
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,960
The book came to cleanse us intellectually, to make us people of thought and exploration and learning.

138
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,640
You know, and this is an intellectual cleansing that's part of, and you know, what should I believe

139
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,480
about Allah? Why should I believe that about Allah? What should I believe about the Prophet's

140
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,480
life? You know, why should I believe that? What should I believe about my relationship with him?

141
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,440
These are intellectual purifications. And then there's a physical purification. Like what? Give me an

142
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,840
example of physical purification in this religion. And actually even what we eat, what we put inside

143
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,200
our body has to be good and pure, isn't it? So the body on the external needs to be pure and also

144
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,680
physically, internally also needs to be pure. And the physical relationships we have with other

145
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,120
human beings, the spouses, has to be pure. All of it has to be pure. So it's not just spiritually

146
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,200
intellectually cleansing, it's actually physically cleansing. And our physical cleanliness is tied

147
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,240
to our intellectual and our spiritual cleanliness. And one of my favorites is the Qur'an's emotional

148
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,600
purification. I loved, I alluded to it before, but I'll tell you some more about it. In Arab culture,

149
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,080
for example, if a husband and wife had an argument with each other and the husband got really mad at

150
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:31,600
his wife, it would say, I hate you so much from today on, when I think of you. It's like I think

151
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:42,320
of my own mother. From today, you are my mother. And she'd be like, this is called the Har. This

152
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,200
was a practice called the Har. The Arabs used to do this. And that means forever again, I will never

153
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,960
be with this woman again. I will never think about her romantically again. I will never be in a

154
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:57,520
relationship with her again, because she is now equal to who? My mother. So it's disgusting now for

155
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,800
me. Allah says in the Qur'an,

156
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,120
All those people who do this with their women, they're not their moms.

157
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,800
Done. I can't believe he said I'm his mom. Allah said, no, they're not. You're not his mom.

158
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,080
You can say whatever you want. Some people are really into drama, right? They say dramatic things.

159
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,520
I mean, I come from South Asia. We're really into drama.

160
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,040
Right? Some moms will say to their son, from today, you are not my son.

161
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,640
I'm still your son.

162
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
There. Can't change that.

163
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,600
Fathers can say, if you do this again, you are no longer my son. Actually, I am.

164
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,880
Okay, the genetics are still. Yeah, I look like you dad. Look at me.

165
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,280
No, no, you can't change that. You can't emotionally blackmail people.

166
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,760
You can't use emotions to control people. Allah even said, you know, and if you I mentioned this

167
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,520
before, emotionally, people, you know, relationships are supposed to be healthy,

168
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,160
which means I have some rights and my wife has some rights. I have some rights. My parents have

169
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,960
some rights. I have some rights. My siblings have some rights. I have responsibilities. They also

170
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,360
have what? Responsibilities. It's a give and take as a balance between both. But what do we do?

171
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,040
We say we use Islam to say, Oh, parents have all the rights.

172
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,640
And children have none of the rights. By the way, the only relationship where one has all the rights

173
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,000
and the other has no rights is Allah and the slave, because Allah has all the rights and we are just

174
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,640
slaves of Allah. We don't have any rights against Allah. Everything Allah gives us is a favor from

175
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:54,080
him. Every other relationship has what? Rights and responsibilities. You think of a mother

176
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,560
who doesn't feed her child and throws him out in the trash and goes to jail because of it. She says,

177
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,840
But in Islam, I have all the rights and that baby I threw in the trash should still treat me with

178
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,760
Ahsan when he grows up one day after he comes out of foster care.

179
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,880
You think she has that right? You think this is what Islam teaches? No. No, there's you have to

180
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,360
do your part. Even in the dua you make for your parents, for example, you say, My master, show them

181
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:31,120
both rahma, but you don't stop there. What do you say? Come on, the way they raised me when I was,

182
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,040
the way they nurtured me when I was small. But if they were beating you up when you were small,

183
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,880
if they were abusing you when you were small, if they were abandoning you when you were small,

184
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,280
if they were drinking alcohol and fighting each other and scarring you psychologically in front

185
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:59,280
of you when you were small, is that rabbiyaani? You know what that is? That's emotional cleansing.

186
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,520
Why? Because now the only emotionally you only carry the burdens Allah made you carry.

187
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,720
And you don't have to carry any burdens and any guilt that Allah did not make you carry.

188
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,240
There are some things emotionally also in our families and in our cultures. There are some

189
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,840
things that are wrong, but they're not wrong in Islam. You know that, right? There are some things

190
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,320
that are culturally very wrong, but they're not wrong in Islam. And when you do something that's

191
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,040
Allah has no problem with it. Completely halal. Allah has no problem with it. And you're doing the

192
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,240
right thing. And everyone in your family says, this is wrong. We hate you. We can't believe you

193
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,280
did this. You're such a shame. Allah will ask you, well, Allah is actually not having a problem at all.

194
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,200
You're having a problem. Allah has no problem. I'm well within my rights. I didn't violate

195
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,280
anybody's rights. I stayed within Allah's shade of halal. You know what Allah does? He removes

196
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,160
that emotional baggage. He cleanses my emotions. I don't have to carry those emotions with me.

197
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,600
I don't have to carry that guilt with me. If I owe real guilt, I owe it to someone who I actually

198
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,640
wronged according to the Book of Allah. If I actually wronged my parents, I owe that. If I

199
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,080
actually wrong some fine, I owe an apology. And the other incredible emotional cleansing that Allah

200
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,400
did is, how many times do you have to make daubat to Allah before Allah accepts the daubat? Tell me.

201
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,080
Sincere daubat, how many times? And then you have to believe that Allah has what?

202
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,120
Forgiven. You have to believe that. We learned that in the Qur'an. Of course,

203
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,000
you should keep making daubat because we make many sins. But if you sincerely, like for example,

204
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,960
you stole when you were a teenager, you were stupid and you ran away with somebody else's

205
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,880
McDonald's fries. You feel really guilty. Now, your next Ramadan, you decided to make daubat for

206
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,520
those fries. You were like, I remember I ate 18 fries. So I'm going to make 18 days of Ramadan,

207
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,200
18 different daubas. No, no, no. You could put the whole packet together and just make one daubat.

208
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,000
Sincerely. You can move on now. You don't have to live inside that guilt. You understand? You can

209
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,200
move on. Musa alayhi salam killed somebody and he made istighfar to Allah. But did he keep on

210
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,280
making istighfar to Allah? He made istighfar to Allah. That's it. Now he's doing good things. He's

211
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:27,120
moved on because he's hoping that Allah will now forgive. That's it. What do we do? Human beings.

212
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,840
Allah says, ask me sincerely once, inna illa haqfirudh lulu ba jami'a. What do human beings do?

213
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,080
Sorry I did that. That's not good enough for me. You know, you're not really sorry, right? Yes,

214
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:45,520
I am. I am sorry. I said I'm sorry. Did you though? And then the next time you're in a bad mood,

215
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,480
you remember what you did, right? But I said sorry for that. Yeah, you said sorry. You think that's

216
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,200
enough? But I didn't just say sorry. I asked you what can I do to make it up to you? And you said

217
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,000
this, this, and this, and I did this, this, and this, and you're bringing it up again? Yeah, well,

218
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,360
I can't let it go. Because I don't think you've paid enough of a price. I don't think Allah will

219
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,440
forgive you because I'm not happy. Oh, this is the last one I'm going to share with you on emotional

220
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:22,400
cleansing that Allah gave us in this book. You know, some people say until I forgive you,

221
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,840
I can guarantee you Allah will not forgive you. I love that one. I love that one. So until I

222
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,640
forgive you, what's going to happen? Allah will not forgive you. Ah, I see. So that means on

223
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,840
judgment day, doesn't matter how much snow by made, how much I corrected myself. If someone is still

224
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,960
mad at me in the world who says I don't forgive this guy, I don't forgive him before I'm about to

225
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:55,600
walk into jannah, he will say, Oh, hold on. I'm still upset. Angels, haul him into hell.

226
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:04,880
You think you and I control Allah's forgiveness? I'll give you just one example to put me and you

227
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,160
in our place, just to put us in our place. Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was in

228
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Uhud and he got injured. He got hit. He fell unconscious. He wakes up from unconsciousness

229
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,400
and he says, how can Allah guide a people that spill its prophet's blood? He was upset with the

230
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:33,840
Quraysh who almost killed him. You know what Allah said to him? You have no authority. You don't

231
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,520
have no authority whatsoever. Or you are a slave to them or you are a slave to them.

232
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,840
Whether he forgives them, accepts their tawbah or he punishes them and they are in fact wrong.

233
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,000
Allah owns whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth.

234
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,280
He forgives whoever he wants and he punishes whoever he wants.

235
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,760
And Allah is forgiving. Allah is the loving and caring one. By the way,

236
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,640
who was the one person in the battle of Uhud that caused the prophet to bleed?

237
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,880
Actually, one person who turned the whole battle around. You know what that is?

238
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,240
His name is Khalid ibn Walid. He was the strategist who saw the Muslims are in a weak position.

239
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,960
We can come around, flank them from behind and that's when everything went bad for the Muslims.

240
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,800
What's his name? Did Allah forgive him? Did he become a Sahabi? The one who was the reason

241
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:33,360
for the prophet almost being killed. Right? Allah says he forgives whoever he wants. He punishes

242
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:41,600
whoever he wants. That's up to Allah. He can tell that to his prophet but you think you're going to

243
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,440
tell Allah that your cousin is not going to get forgiven because you're still mad. Whatever Allah

244
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,480
does with them, that's between Allah and him. You have your dealing with Allah and Allah says about

245
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,320
judgment. Allah will heal the hearts of believers. Yes, there may be somebody who's caused you pain

246
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,960
and you feel like they got away with it and maybe they'll just make tawbah. Thank you.

247
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,440
I like this better. These things make me sneeze more. I'll love the gesture.

248
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,320
At least I'm not sneezing so that's how happy I am about that because the amount of angels today.

249
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,160
Oh man. Okay. Anyway, so now let's move on to financial cleansing.

250
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,280
Here's what's coming up in the next episode and this deeper look of Surat al-Jumu'ah.

251
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,200
You know? Like for example, in many cultures you cannot get married until you have this much

252
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,680
degree, this much money. You've done this, this, this, this, and then maybe we'll think about getting

253
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,560
you married. And then once you are ready to get married, the mahat has to be this amount and this

254
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,280
amount and this amount. And then if you are going to get married, we have to have this kind of a hall

255
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,560
and this kind of catering and these kinds of gifts and there's like the bill keeps going higher and

256
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:03,840
higher and higher and higher. And what Allah did in Islam is he made the path to halal easy

257
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,360
and the path to haram difficult. And what many cultures do is they make the path to halal

258
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,200
extremely what? Difficult. And when you make the path to halal difficult automatically,

259
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,360
what becomes a lot easier? The haram becomes way easier. It's so much easier. You know?
