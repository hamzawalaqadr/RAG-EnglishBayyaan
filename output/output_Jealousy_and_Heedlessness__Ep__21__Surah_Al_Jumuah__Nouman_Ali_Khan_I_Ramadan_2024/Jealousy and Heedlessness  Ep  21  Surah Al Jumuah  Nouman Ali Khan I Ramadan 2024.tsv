0	8000	Allah put inside the male something. He put inside the male the desire to look at beauty.
8000	12000	I don't have to convince you of this, you already know.
12000	18000	You're like somebody's like, I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do.
18000	26000	He put inside the male the desire to look at beauty. He put inside the female the desire to look beautiful.
26000	31000	He put it in her from the early ages. Allah put that in her fitrah.
56000	61000	I want to say this in the form of a word and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also. Thank you.
86000	92000	Peace be upon the Messenger of Allah and his family and his companions. Peace be upon you.
92000	98000	Wrapping up our discussion on ayat number six. I'm going to read something from I believe this is Ibn Ashur Rahman Allah.
98000	107000	That is because believers are supposed to be between hope and fear from Allah.
107000	111000	So we don't wish for death because we are between hope and fear from Allah.
111000	124000	They do not assume and live with the assumption that success is guaranteed for them as these people assumed.
124000	130000	Now we get to the next ayat. By the way, all three ayats are going to be about death and we get this kind of philosophy on death also.
130000	140000	They will never wish for it because now the translation says because of what their hands are holding.
140000	145000	That's the literal translation because of what their hands put forward.
145000	154000	Now the first thing I want to share with you is disclaimers.
154000	160000	In the previous ayat, the disclaimer was if you feel you are saved as opposed to everyone else, that was the qualifier.
160000	164000	Or if you are Allah's friends as opposed to everyone else.
164000	171000	We should want to be friends with Allah but the Muslim will not think as opposed to everyone else because Allah already told us,
171000	178000	other people are going to join. Allah already told us if you step back Allah will replace you with other people.
178000	183000	So we don't have this absolute guarantee that it's us and no one else can ever take our place.
183000	188000	We don't have that mentality because Allah didn't let us have that mentality in His revelation.
188000	198000	Now in this next ayat Allah doesn't just say they're never going to wish for death but Allah says why will some of them never wish for death?
198000	201000	Why is it that they won't wish? Allah gives the reason Himself.
201000	203000	He says,
203000	209000	And now before I explain what that means, just something about the ba in Bima Qadamat-e-Adihim.
209000	216000	Saba-biyatun, buta-alliqatun, Bima yadullu aalayhin nafi, aya-bawnat-at-tamanni, Bisaba Bima Qadamat.
216000	221000	What that means is literally because the word ba would mean because.
221000	228000	In other words, they will not wish for death because of stuff they've already done in the past.
228000	232000	So because of what their hands have done refers to what they've done in the past.
232000	234000	So the word because would be the meaning of ba.
234000	235000	The other,
235000	241000	جوزة عالنقه بالانتفائيك أنه قيل انتفا تمنىهم بسبب ما قدرت.
241000	246000	The other meaning is they no longer have that desire.
246000	253000	They used to have it, but they don't have it anymore because of something that's happened, because of some deeds of theirs.
253000	258000	In other words, they did actually have the desire to meet Allah in a good way and all of that,
258000	261000	but over time because of sins that desire went away.
261000	267000	The only way we can unlock the meanings of this ayah is actually to understand the phrase Bima Qadamat Aideehim.
267000	275000	That's the core, that's the crux of this ayah, which is they won't wish for it because of what their hands sent forward.
275000	277000	At taqdeem, what does qadama mean?
277000	281000	أصله جعل الشيء مقدمن, to put something in front, that's مقدم.
281000	287000	So for example, I'm sitting here, I put the laptop in front of me, I made the laptop مقدم.
287000	289000	I put it ahead of myself, okay?
289000	291000	أسابقا meaning I had.
291000	293000	غيره في بكان يقعه في غيره.
293000	295000	والأي دي مجازن في الاقتصاب.
295000	299000	And the hands is an expression in Arabic for earning deeds.
299000	306000	The أن اليد يلزموا الاقتصابه غالبا meaning deeds, our actions are done by our hands for the most part.
306000	310000	So when someone says, you had a hand in this.
310000	312000	Somebody says you had a hand in this.
312000	314000	You know what that means? You were involved in this.
314000	317000	It doesn't literally mean you had your hands stuck in this.
317000	319000	It means you were involved in this.
319000	321000	So it's a figure of speech for involvement or actions.
321000	326000	Now, the Qur'an repeatedly talks about this concept of dakdim.
326000	331000	A good way for you guys to think about that in easy English is prioritizing.
331000	334000	To make something a priority.
334000	340000	Every day in our lives, we have to make a decision about what is the top priority.
340000	344000	Like if you have one hour before class starts, what is your priority?
344000	346000	What are you going to do first, second, third?
346000	349000	And the morning you wake up, you have a list of priorities you got to get done.
349000	351000	Everybody has a checklist.
351000	355000	And in that checklist, what is the most important and second important and third important?
355000	358000	It's either in our head or it's on your calendar or you've made notes.
358000	363000	When your wife or husband or whoever sends you to the grocery store,
363000	366000	then you have a checklist, priority items to get.
366000	370000	Like if you have a baby, you can forget everything, don't come home without the diapers.
370000	374000	That was the most important thing. How did you forget that?
374000	378000	So there's always this concept of priority, meaning something that takes more importance.
378000	383000	And every one of us knows at the end of the day, we were not able to do all the things we were supposed to do.
383000	386000	There's always things that are left that we were supposed to do, right?
386000	392000	But those things became mu'akhar. They got delayed because other things became muqaddam.
392000	393000	They became forward.
393000	398000	Qaddam at Aideehim also means some things became priority for these people.
398000	403000	Some behaviors, some goals became a bigger priority.
403000	408000	And those goals took them away from the friendship of Allah.
408000	412000	Actually, the previous ayah basically says if you truly were friends of Allah,
412000	416000	then you would wish at least for a good death in one way you can take the meaning.
416000	420000	So now they won't wish it because they're not really friends with Allah.
420000	425000	So then the question is what did they do that took them away from Allah's friendship?
425000	428000	Allah's closeness, Allah's protectiveness.
428000	432000	And that is some wrong things became priority for them.
432000	435000	So this discussion is brief but important.
435000	438000	And that is what does it mean that the wrong things become priority?
438000	440000	There's two things I want you to note here.
440000	443000	One is things that are prohibited or forbidden or evil.
443000	451000	Meaning my desire, my lust, my greed, my jealousy, these kinds of things.
451000	456000	When they become the top thought in your mind, I actually wrote this down in my notes.
456000	461000	I want to read this to you because this has to do with desgiyah also.
461000	465000	You know how the ayah said Allah purifies them with the ayat?
465000	468000	So here are some things I want you to make note of.
468000	472000	Anger, jealousy, comparison, worthlessness.
472000	475000	I know there's a lot more. I'm talking fast. It's okay.
475000	477000	You can repeat. What was it?
477000	489000	Anger, jealousy, comparison, worthlessness, loneliness, greed, lust, heedlessness.
489000	494000	Heedlessness basically means I don't fear anything.
494000	496000	I don't worry about anything.
496000	501000	I just...heedlessness is basically I don't care.
501000	505000	That's heedlessness. I don't care attitude.
505000	513000	Heedinism. My ultimate objective is to please myself, to have a good experience.
513000	517000	A good definition of hedonism in easy English would be YOLO.
517000	520000	You guys know YOLO? That would be hedonism.
520000	523000	And materialism.
523000	526000	So materialism takes many forms.
526000	529000	For some people materialism is about their house.
529000	531000	Some people it's their car.
531000	534000	Some people it's how many followers they have on social media.
534000	537000	For some people it's what kind of...what brand of bag are they wearing?
537000	539000	What brand of shoes are they wearing?
539000	543000	So hedonism...this materialism takes different kinds of forms.
543000	545000	Basically shallow things.
545000	547000	You know shallow petty things that they become obsessions.
547000	555000	Anyway, the Quran comes and it cleanses us from all of these or at least controls them.
555000	558000	Because at the end of the day anger is a part of my life.
558000	559000	I can't get rid of it.
559000	561000	Some things are going to make me angry.
561000	564000	What Dasgih does is it keeps it under a limit.
564000	566000	It keeps it within a healthy limit.
566000	569000	Jealousy, you might think, oh jealousy so evil.
569000	571000	No, jealousy is a part of life.
571000	573000	It happens.
573000	574000	Jealousy happens.
574000	575000	Comparison happens.
575000	581000	But it has to stay within a healthy limit and needs to be directed in a healthy direction.
581000	585000	You know, so you can take someone who's doing better than you
585000	589000	and you could be jealous of them or you could be inspired to do better yourself.
589000	591000	So you could take...you could feel that they're doing better
591000	593000	and you can take it in a positive direction, right?
593000	595000	So that's what Dasgih does.
595000	598000	Worthlessness, oh it doesn't matter what I do anyway.
598000	600000	I'm a loser anyway.
600000	601000	Who cares about me?
601000	603000	You know, like those people that say dunya has nothing?
603000	606000	Well then eventually they start saying I'm nothing.
606000	609000	When you're nothing then your actions are nothing,
609000	611000	which means that you could be mean, you could be rude, you could be whatever,
611000	613000	but it doesn't matter because I'm worthless
613000	615000	so I'm going to treat everybody else worthless too.
615000	619000	A lot of times people that are really insulting to others,
619000	623000	deep down inside they actually have no respect for themselves.
623000	625000	They have a deep worthlessness within themselves
625000	627000	and they project that on others.
627000	630000	The Quran makes me feel that I'm worth something.
630000	634000	I'm worth enough of a miracle that all the angels were commanded to do sajda.
634000	636000	I'm worth enough that Allah says,
636000	641000	We honored all children of Adam, which means Allah Himself honored me.
641000	644000	Which means Allah sees me as worth something.
644000	646000	So I shouldn't see myself as worthless.
646000	651000	Loneliness, you know, nobody loves me, nobody understands me, nobody listens to me.
651000	654000	It's like I don't even exist, etc. etc.
654000	656000	Well we're the religion of Ibrahim, alayhis-salam.
656000	659000	I don't think there was anybody who was more lonely than Ibrahim, alayhis-salam.
659000	662000	But Allah gave him his company, didn't He?
662000	665000	What a have Allah and Ibrahim a Khalilah.
665000	670000	Right? So we don't actually know what true loneliness in the end
670000	672000	will actually never be loneliness for a believer.
672000	676000	They'll still have someone and doesn't mean that you don't need anybody in you.
676000	677000	I have Allah, I don't need anyone.
677000	679000	I'm like Ibrahim, alayhis-salam. I don't need you.
679000	683000	No, no, no. Even Musa, alayhis-salam needed Harun.
683000	686000	Right? He asked for Harun. He didn't say I'm going to go do this alone.
686000	688000	But at least you know how to cope with loneliness.
688000	693000	At least you know how to work through loneliness because of the tazkiyah of the Quran.
693000	697000	Then greed, of course. We all want more. Let's be honest.
697000	700000	There's a car you don't have that you like.
700000	705000	There's a house that you drive by, you drive a little slowly.
705000	706000	And then go.
706000	709000	You know, there's a job that you might like.
709000	713000	There's a, you know, we have greed. We have some things that we want that we don't have.
713000	716000	But that's kept under control.
716000	724000	And whoever can be protected from the greed they have inside them.
724000	728000	Meaning it's there but it's not taking over you.
728000	730000	Right? It's being controlled.
730000	734000	The same way Allah says in another place, for example,
735000	740000	Allah put explosive content inside us.
740000	743000	And He also put inside us the ability to protect us from that explosive content.
743000	748000	Fujur means sin, but fujur actually comes from infijar, which means explosion.
748000	751000	Fajr is called fajr because the light explodes.
751000	754000	Right? So there's, my anger is explosive.
754000	757000	My jealousy is explosive. My desires are explosive.
757000	760000	My materialism can be explosive. All this stuff is explosive, man.
760000	762000	It can take over. It can blow up.
762000	765000	But Allah gave us protective mechanisms to keep it under control.
765000	769000	And that's what the revelation does. It starts putting a check on these things.
769000	773000	So now I mentioned these things when I say that they will not wish for death
773000	775000	because of what their hands prioritized.
775000	781000	Some of these things, greed, jealousy, you know, status, you know, your own pride,
781000	785000	even I'm adding other things, heedlessness, they become priority.
785000	788000	They take over somebody's life.
788000	793000	And then when that happens, the religion, the Deen of Allah, becomes secondary.
793000	798000	The Deen of Allah is only going to be practiced when it doesn't get in the way of my own priorities.
798000	801000	My priorities are first, the religion is second.
801000	806000	So an easy example would be, for example, you're in university, you're on campus,
806000	809000	it's time for the prayer, and you're hanging out with a bunch of friends.
809000	812000	Right? And you're like, you know it's got to use time for prayer,
812000	814000	but most of your friends are non-Muslim.
814000	817000	So if you're going to go pray, then they're going to look at you funny.
817000	823000	They're going to say something, don't blow up the library, you know, nine, nine.
823000	825000	Okay?
825000	831000	And you're like, I don't want to hear those comments, so you know what, I'm just not going to pray.
831000	834000	Not this time. I'll delay it.
834000	838000	Now the thing is, in that moment, what did you prioritize?
838000	844000	You prioritized your, the preservation of your dignity, right?
844000	849000	Because you thought you'll preserve your dignity, you won't have to hear those comments, right?
849000	853000	You won't have to hear that ridicule, or you won't have to hear their criticisms later on,
853000	855000	and you saved yourself from that.
855000	857000	You put that as a priority.
857000	862000	People's opinion of you became a priority over what Allah said.
862000	864000	Some people asked the question, it was in the comments.
864000	867000	I mentioned that there's the letter of the law and the spirit of the law,
867000	870000	and there's the letter of the hijab, and there's the spirit of the hijab.
870000	873000	And I did mention the spirit of the hijab, and people were like, what's the spirit?
873000	874000	What's the spirit?
874000	879000	I've given long lectures on surat al-Nur and the ayah of hijab, but I will tell you guys,
879000	881000	because I like Stuttgart, so I'll tell you briefly.
881000	885000	Allah describes in the Quran that a female, the way Allah made,
885000	888000	I didn't say this, just in the Quran, take it up with Allah, okay?
888000	890000	Allah says,
894000	898000	The baby girl is described as someone who is decorated in jewelry.
898000	905000	Young female, a little baby girl, but she already has a desire to be beautiful.
905000	909000	The boy never puts on a shirt and says, look at my shirt.
909000	912000	Dad, look at my shirt.
912000	918000	But a little girl, you put on anything on her, you put on a rubber band on her wrist,
918000	924000	you put on a necklace made of paper, you put on anything, what's she gonna do?
925000	930000	Say something, say something.
930000	933000	And you just tell, he looks a pradia.
933000	935000	I know.
935000	941000	Allah put inside the male something.
941000	945000	He put inside the male the desire to look at beauty.
945000	949000	I don't have to convince you of this, you already know.
950000	954000	You're like, somebody's like, I don't know what you're talking about.
954000	956000	Yes, you do.
956000	959000	He put inside the male the desire to look at beauty.
959000	963000	He put inside the female the desire to look beautiful.
963000	966000	He put it in her from the early ages.
966000	968000	Allah put that in her fitrah.
968000	974000	Now, Surah An-Nur, where Allah describes the head covering,
974000	977000	Allah describes that men must guard their eyes.
977000	980000	They must guard their eyes.
980000	988000	Why? Because the thing that men get the most pleasure out of is looking at beauty.
988000	994000	And the proof of that is in all of the online and media industries
994000	1001000	that attract the eyes of men towards female beauty in the worst ways.
1001000	1005000	And those industries make billions, if not trillions of dollars,
1005000	1009000	all because of these that men have.
1009000	1010000	You know that, right?
1010000	1016000	Like the proof, there's trillions of dollars of proof of something Allah has said.
1016000	1017000	Okay?
1017000	1024000	On the flip side, Allah put a desire in women not to,
1024000	1026000	even though they want to look at beauty,
1026000	1028000	but they have a much stronger desire than looking,
1028000	1030000	what's the stronger desire for them?
1030000	1032000	To look beautiful.
1032000	1038000	And there are trillions of dollars of investment in the makeup industry,
1038000	1041000	the fashion industry, the modeling industry,
1041000	1046000	the advertising industries across the planet
1046000	1050000	that are evidence to that fact that Allah mentions in Surah An-Nur.
1050000	1053000	He mentions, these are facts,
1053000	1056000	that human beings are living evidence of it every day.
1056000	1061000	Economies, entire gigantic economies are evidence of this.
1061000	1063000	If you know people that work in social media
1063000	1065000	and they work in social media advertising,
1065000	1069000	they know about Google Trends and the social media trend, video trends,
1069000	1071000	you know what I'm talking about.
1071000	1073000	You know exactly what I'm talking about.
1073000	1078000	Now, having said that, the thing that men desire the most,
1078000	1083000	they have to control it if they have to keep the light in their heart.
1083000	1085000	So men were told what?
1085000	1087000	Lower your eyes.
1087000	1090000	Women were told, and when women are told lower your eyes,
1090000	1092000	that's way easier for women.
1092000	1094000	It's like, whatever.
1094000	1096000	One in 10,000 men, they're like, oh.
1096000	1099000	Otherwise, men, it's not one in 10,000 women.
1099000	1102000	Women don't have major fit now when they're walking in an area
1102000	1104000	where they don't have a lot of money.
1104000	1106000	They don't have a lot of money.
1106000	1108000	They don't have a lot of money.
1108000	1110000	They don't have a lot of money.
1110000	1114000	Women don't have major fit now when they're walking in an airport.
1114000	1116000	Everyone in a thousand men.
1116000	1121000	Sometimes, some use of light type, you know, situation.
1121000	1123000	They're like, oh, okay.
1123000	1124000	But men,
1124000	1128000	As tak fir la, as tak fir la, as tak fir la, as tak fir la, as tak fir la.
1132000	1134000	Different problem.
1134000	1137000	Different, but what is the hardest thing for a female?
1137000	1139000	As hard it is for a man to lower his eyes.
1139000	1141000	You know what's equally hard for her?
1141000	1143000	Not to look pretty.
1144000	1146000	That's the hardest thing for her.
1146000	1148000	It is so hard for her.
1148000	1151000	If you want to understand how hard it is for her,
1151000	1154000	it's as hard as it is for you to what?
1154000	1155000	Lower your eyes.
1155000	1159000	You know how every second you have to fight that?
1159000	1161000	Every minute, you're like, alhamdulillah.
1161000	1163000	I finished the lower eyes problem.
1163000	1165000	Now I used to have that problem last year.
1165000	1167000	I no longer have that problem anymore.
1167000	1168000	It's on autopilot.
1168000	1170000	Is it ever on autopilot?
1170000	1173000	No, you have to guard it every single time.
1173000	1175000	Guess what women have to go through?
1175000	1178000	The desire to look beautiful doesn't go away.
1178000	1181000	They see another woman with beautifully hair done.
1181000	1183000	They're like, she's got nothing on my hair.
1183000	1186000	My hair is so much nicer under the sejab, though.
1186000	1190000	And every time they see a woman with beautiful hair,
1190000	1192000	with her looks,
1192000	1195000	and they're like, oh my God,
1195000	1198000	I can show this so much better than she can.
1198000	1200000	She didn't even know.
1200000	1203000	And it's killing them because it's all hidden.
1203000	1205000	It's hidden all the time.
1205000	1209000	And it's like, I look so ugly.
1209000	1211000	I look so ugly right now.
1211000	1213000	And they get to, they're not even that pretty.
1213000	1214000	And people think they're pretty.
1214000	1215000	People don't even know.
1215000	1217000	I'm so much prettier.
1218000	1221000	And there's this deep down inside struggle.
1221000	1225000	And Allah says, yeah, you're going to control that one.
1225000	1227000	You're going to control that one.
1227000	1229000	In order to what?
1229000	1232000	To keep the light in your heart.
1232000	1234000	To keep the light in your heart.
1234000	1237000	The strongest impulse of men
1237000	1241000	that will destroy the state of their heart is that.
1241000	1243000	And the strongest impulse for women
1243000	1245000	that will destroy the state of their heart is that
1245000	1247000	this was about protecting their hearts.
1247000	1249000	That's actually what it was.
1249000	1251000	It's the Quran.
1251000	1252000	We say, oh, it's far, it's far.
1252000	1253000	Hold on.
1253000	1255000	How did the Quran talk about it?
1255000	1257000	Why is it in surah al-Nur?
1257000	1260000	Why isn't the surah that protects the Nur inside the heart?
1260000	1262000	Why is it there?
1262000	1263000	Why is it talked about like this?
1263000	1266000	Anyway, that's not my subject, but I'm just saying.
1266000	1270000	But imagine, if that's, for some people,
1270000	1273000	they can't wish, how can they wish for meeting with Allah
1273000	1277000	when their desire, their other priorities
1277000	1278000	became more important.
1278000	1280000	And you know what happens then?
1280000	1283000	If I took me in on a bit of the kitabi, what I could for a bit of it.
1283000	1286000	My desire to look, or my desire on the female side
1286000	1289000	to look beautiful was too strong.
1289000	1290000	I couldn't control it.
1290000	1293000	Now I'm going to say, you know what?
1293000	1296000	Just because I don't do it doesn't mean I'm not a good believer.
1296000	1298000	I'm really spiritual, you know.
1298000	1300000	And I'm going to make lots of Instagram posts about
1300000	1301000	how I fast on Monday and Thursday
1301000	1304000	and how I do tahajjud and how I do this and how I do that.
1304000	1307000	And you know, who are you telling this to? Instagram?
1307000	1310000	Who needs to hear this?
1310000	1313000	Who needs to hear Allah SWT?
1313000	1316000	Do I need to broadcast? How many enough did I pray?
1316000	1318000	How much I fasted? What sadaqa I did?
1318000	1319000	What zikr I did?
1319000	1323000	What naa, this is just you know something deep inside.
1323000	1327000	You know that you're doing something that's not okay
1327000	1329000	and you're trying to tell yourself,
1329000	1331000	but at least I'm doing so much other good.
1331000	1333000	Don't judge me. Don't judge me.
1333000	1335000	I said don't judge me.
1335000	1339000	Nobody's judging you, but actually deep down inside
1339000	1343000	you can't help but also judge yourself.
1343000	1346000	بَلِ الْإِنْسَانُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيْعَ
1346000	1349000	A human being has full view of their own selves.
1349000	1351000	No one has to judge you.
1351000	1353000	You have to judge yourself.
1353000	1355000	And you should judge yourself.
1355000	1357000	And this new nonsense,
1357000	1360000	be merciful to yourself.
1360000	1363000	Give yourself room to be human.
1363000	1365000	It's okay.
1365000	1366000	It's okay.
1366000	1369000	That it's okay is so, the Quran's expression for that is
1369000	1371000	سَوْوَلَتْ لَكُمْ عَنْفُسُكُمْ عَمْرَى
1371000	1375000	You made something convenient for yourselves.
1375000	1378000	You said brothers made something convenient for themselves.
1378000	1379000	It's okay.
1379000	1381000	Obviously, Dad doesn't love us.
1381000	1383000	It's okay if we just take one, we're not killing all the brothers,
1383000	1385000	we're just killing one of them.
1385000	1388000	And we're going to be good after that.
1388000	1391000	سَوْوَلَتْ لَكُمْ عَنْفُسُكُمْ عَمْرَى
1391000	1394000	You know, this is actually something that we have to really,
1394000	1396000	really learn about.
1396000	1398000	قَدَّ تَقْدِيمُ الْأَيدْ
1398000	1400000	What is it that we are prioritizing?
1400000	1404000	Is it that impulse that is a bigger priority than the word of Allah?
1404000	1406000	For men or for women?
1406000	1409000	What is keeping me from praying?
1409000	1413000	What's keeping me from giving up the haram money that I'm making?
1413000	1414000	What's keeping me?
1414000	1416000	What's keeping me from lying?
1416000	1419000	What's keeping me from giving the money that I owe?
1419000	1421000	To I borrowed somebody's money, I didn't give it back.
1421000	1424000	What's keeping me from giving back that money?
1424000	1427000	Something else became a priority over the word of Allah
1427000	1430000	and those are the kinds of people who will never wish to meet with Allah.
1430000	1432000	They can't. How can they?
1432000	1433000	How can they?
1433000	1434000	وَدَا يَتَمَنَّا وُنَّا
1434000	1436000	وُعَبَدَنْ بِمَا قَدَّمَدْ اَيْدِيمِ
1436000	1438000	By the way, those kinds of people,
1438000	1442000	when they have that, it's called cognitive dissonance,
1442000	1445000	meaning they're believers, but they prioritize the wrong thing
1445000	1447000	and they know they're violating the word of Allah.
1447000	1449000	You know what they do then?
1449000	1450000	The Quran is so accurate.
1450000	1451000	You know what they do?
1451000	1454000	They talk a lot about the mercy of Allah.
1454000	1458000	Those people talk a lot about how Allah forgives,
1458000	1461000	how Allah is merciful, how Allah is so loving,
1461000	1464000	how Allah is so kind, how Allah knows what you're going through.
1464000	1466000	Allah is for... Why?
1466000	1470000	Because there's another side to your relationship with Allah
1470000	1471000	that they don't want to deal with.
1471000	1472000	You know what that side is?
1472000	1473000	You're going to stand in front of Allah.
1473000	1476000	You're going to explain yourself what you did, what you did.
1476000	1478000	I don't want to deal with that part of it.
1478000	1480000	I want to deal with Allah is my friend.
1480000	1481000	What did I say?
1481000	1484000	قُلْ يَا يُهَلَّتِنْهَا دُوْ إِنْزَعَنْتُمْ
1484000	1485000	أَنَّكُمْ أَوْ لِيَا أُولِ اللَّهِ
1485000	1488000	مِنْ دُونِ النَّاسْ بَتَمَنَّا وُلْمَوتِنْ كُدُمْ صَدِقْرِينْ
1488000	1490000	Why do they think they're friends with Allah?
1490000	1493000	Because if you're friends, Allah is always going to be okay with me.
1493000	1494000	I'm going to be saved.
1494000	1495000	Allah is merciful.
1495000	1496000	Allah is loving.
1496000	1499000	Allah is guaranteeing me Jannah.
1499000	1501000	That's because the wrong priorities.
1501000	1507000	It's the wrong priorities that say, I'm going to look at one dimension of my relationship with God, not the other.
1507000	1509000	Not the other.
1509000	1515000	And understand from this the Christian concept of God is God is love.
1515000	1516000	Right?
1516000	1519000	For the Israelites, the God is the savior of the Israelites.
1519000	1521000	He's the God of Israel.
1521000	1523000	Actually, he's the God of Israel.
1523000	1530000	For Muslims, Allah is many names at the same time.
1530000	1533000	So he loves us more than we can love ourselves.
1533000	1536000	He can judge us more than anybody else can judge us.
1536000	1540000	He can hold us responsible, accountable more than anybody else can.
1540000	1542000	It's not one relationship.
1542000	1544000	It's multiple relationships.
1544000	1550000	We don't get to pick one of them and say, I'm going to ignore the others because of our own issues.
1550000	1557000	So what we do is we, because we have our own issues, we hold on to some names of Allah and forget other names of Allah.
1557000	1560000	And that's exactly what they did in Awliya.
1560000	1561000	We did not do it without people.
1561000	1563000	We hope that death will come to the truthful.
1563000	1565000	We hope that it will never come to them.
1565000	1570000	And Allah knows who the wrongdoers are.
1570000	1571000	Allah knows the wrong you're doing.
1571000	1572000	Allah knows fully well.
1572000	1575000	You see how interrogative that is?
1575000	1580000	What a precise surgical response that is from Allah.
1580000	1582000	Now, this is a scary picture.
1582000	1583000	But okay.
1583000	1585000	Thank you, Lean.
1585000	1587000	Okay, let's see why that's scary.
1588000	1593000	Here's what's coming up in the next episode and this deeper look of Surat Al-Jumu'ah.
1593000	1598000	A'mal means to do something and fi'il also means to do something.
1598000	1601000	But when you do something without thinking about it, it's a fi'il.
1601000	1603000	So any action can be a fi'il.
1603000	1604000	Breathing right now for me is a fi'il.
1604000	1607000	When I open my eyes and I see you guys, that's a fi'il.
1607000	1610000	But if I choose one person to stare at, then that would be a amal.
1610000	1612000	Because it's a conscious act.
1612000	1614000	So amal includes intent.
1614000	1619000	Fi'il does not include intent necessarily, but amal absolutely includes intent.
1619000	1625000	So Allah is saying, He will inform you of the things you did intently, knowingly, consciously.
1625000	1626000	Okay?
1626000	1629000	Now we're coming to the most exciting part before the break.
1629000	1631000	I need five minutes, guys.
1631000	1632000	Is that okay?
1632000	1633000	Five minutes.
1633000	1634000	Okay.
1634000	1638000	We've finished two sections of the Surah today.
1638000	1641000	And I'm going to give you a review of Section 1.
1641000	1644000	Section 1 was like this.
1644000	1646000	Everything in the skies and the earth does to speed.
1646000	1649000	You sabbihulillahimafi al-samawati wumafil ard.
1649000	1650000	You remember that?
1650000	1651000	Then He was the king.
1651000	1657000	Al-malik, then al-Quddus, then al-Azeez, then al-Hakeem.
1657000	1660000	Then Allah said, He sent to you.
