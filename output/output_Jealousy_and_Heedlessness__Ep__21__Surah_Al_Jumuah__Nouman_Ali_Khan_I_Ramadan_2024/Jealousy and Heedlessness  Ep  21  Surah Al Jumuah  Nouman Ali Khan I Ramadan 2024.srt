1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Allah put inside the male something. He put inside the male the desire to look at beauty.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't have to convince you of this, you already know.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're like somebody's like, I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He put inside the male the desire to look at beauty. He put inside the female the desire to look beautiful.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He put it in her from the early ages. Allah put that in her fitrah.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I want to say this in the form of a word and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also. Thank you.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Peace be upon the Messenger of Allah and his family and his companions. Peace be upon you.

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Wrapping up our discussion on ayat number six. I'm going to read something from I believe this is Ibn Ashur Rahman Allah.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That is because believers are supposed to be between hope and fear from Allah.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So we don't wish for death because we are between hope and fear from Allah.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They do not assume and live with the assumption that success is guaranteed for them as these people assumed.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now we get to the next ayat. By the way, all three ayats are going to be about death and we get this kind of philosophy on death also.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They will never wish for it because now the translation says because of what their hands are holding.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's the literal translation because of what their hands put forward.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now the first thing I want to share with you is disclaimers.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In the previous ayat, the disclaimer was if you feel you are saved as opposed to everyone else, that was the qualifier.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Or if you are Allah's friends as opposed to everyone else.

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We should want to be friends with Allah but the Muslim will not think as opposed to everyone else because Allah already told us,

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
other people are going to join. Allah already told us if you step back Allah will replace you with other people.

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So we don't have this absolute guarantee that it's us and no one else can ever take our place.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We don't have that mentality because Allah didn't let us have that mentality in His revelation.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now in this next ayat Allah doesn't just say they're never going to wish for death but Allah says why will some of them never wish for death?

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why is it that they won't wish? Allah gives the reason Himself.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He says,

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And now before I explain what that means, just something about the ba in Bima Qadamat-e-Adihim.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Saba-biyatun, buta-alliqatun, Bima yadullu aalayhin nafi, aya-bawnat-at-tamanni, Bisaba Bima Qadamat.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What that means is literally because the word ba would mean because.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
In other words, they will not wish for death because of stuff they've already done in the past.

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So because of what their hands have done refers to what they've done in the past.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So the word because would be the meaning of ba.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The other,

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
جوزة عالنقه بالانتفائيك أنه قيل انتفا تمنىهم بسبب ما قدرت.

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The other meaning is they no longer have that desire.

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
They used to have it, but they don't have it anymore because of something that's happened, because of some deeds of theirs.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In other words, they did actually have the desire to meet Allah in a good way and all of that,

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
but over time because of sins that desire went away.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The only way we can unlock the meanings of this ayah is actually to understand the phrase Bima Qadamat Aideehim.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's the core, that's the crux of this ayah, which is they won't wish for it because of what their hands sent forward.

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
At taqdeem, what does qadama mean?

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
أصله جعل الشيء مقدمن, to put something in front, that's مقدم.

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So for example, I'm sitting here, I put the laptop in front of me, I made the laptop مقدم.

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I put it ahead of myself, okay?

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
أسابقا meaning I had.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
غيره في بكان يقعه في غيره.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
والأي دي مجازن في الاقتصاب.

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And the hands is an expression in Arabic for earning deeds.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The أن اليد يلزموا الاقتصابه غالبا meaning deeds, our actions are done by our hands for the most part.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So when someone says, you had a hand in this.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Somebody says you had a hand in this.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You know what that means? You were involved in this.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It doesn't literally mean you had your hands stuck in this.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It means you were involved in this.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So it's a figure of speech for involvement or actions.

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Now, the Qur'an repeatedly talks about this concept of dakdim.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A good way for you guys to think about that in easy English is prioritizing.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
To make something a priority.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Every day in our lives, we have to make a decision about what is the top priority.

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Like if you have one hour before class starts, what is your priority?

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What are you going to do first, second, third?

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And the morning you wake up, you have a list of priorities you got to get done.

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Everybody has a checklist.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And in that checklist, what is the most important and second important and third important?

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's either in our head or it's on your calendar or you've made notes.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
When your wife or husband or whoever sends you to the grocery store,

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
then you have a checklist, priority items to get.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Like if you have a baby, you can forget everything, don't come home without the diapers.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That was the most important thing. How did you forget that?

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So there's always this concept of priority, meaning something that takes more importance.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And every one of us knows at the end of the day, we were not able to do all the things we were supposed to do.

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There's always things that are left that we were supposed to do, right?

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But those things became mu'akhar. They got delayed because other things became muqaddam.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They became forward.

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Qaddam at Aideehim also means some things became priority for these people.

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Some behaviors, some goals became a bigger priority.

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And those goals took them away from the friendship of Allah.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Actually, the previous ayah basically says if you truly were friends of Allah,

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
then you would wish at least for a good death in one way you can take the meaning.

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So now they won't wish it because they're not really friends with Allah.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So then the question is what did they do that took them away from Allah's friendship?

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Allah's closeness, Allah's protectiveness.

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And that is some wrong things became priority for them.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So this discussion is brief but important.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And that is what does it mean that the wrong things become priority?

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's two things I want you to note here.

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
One is things that are prohibited or forbidden or evil.

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Meaning my desire, my lust, my greed, my jealousy, these kinds of things.

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
When they become the top thought in your mind, I actually wrote this down in my notes.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want to read this to you because this has to do with desgiyah also.

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You know how the ayah said Allah purifies them with the ayat?

90
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So here are some things I want you to make note of.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Anger, jealousy, comparison, worthlessness.

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I know there's a lot more. I'm talking fast. It's okay.

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You can repeat. What was it?

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Anger, jealousy, comparison, worthlessness, loneliness, greed, lust, heedlessness.

95
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Heedlessness basically means I don't fear anything.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't worry about anything.

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I just...heedlessness is basically I don't care.

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's heedlessness. I don't care attitude.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Heedinism. My ultimate objective is to please myself, to have a good experience.

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
A good definition of hedonism in easy English would be YOLO.

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You guys know YOLO? That would be hedonism.

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And materialism.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So materialism takes many forms.

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
For some people materialism is about their house.

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Some people it's their car.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Some people it's how many followers they have on social media.

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
For some people it's what kind of...what brand of bag are they wearing?

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What brand of shoes are they wearing?

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So hedonism...this materialism takes different kinds of forms.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Basically shallow things.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know shallow petty things that they become obsessions.

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Anyway, the Quran comes and it cleanses us from all of these or at least controls them.

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because at the end of the day anger is a part of my life.

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I can't get rid of it.

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Some things are going to make me angry.

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What Dasgih does is it keeps it under a limit.

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It keeps it within a healthy limit.

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Jealousy, you might think, oh jealousy so evil.

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No, jealousy is a part of life.

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It happens.

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Jealousy happens.

122
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Comparison happens.

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But it has to stay within a healthy limit and needs to be directed in a healthy direction.

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You know, so you can take someone who's doing better than you

125
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and you could be jealous of them or you could be inspired to do better yourself.

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you could take...you could feel that they're doing better

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and you can take it in a positive direction, right?

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So that's what Dasgih does.

129
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Worthlessness, oh it doesn't matter what I do anyway.

130
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm a loser anyway.

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Who cares about me?

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You know, like those people that say dunya has nothing?

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well then eventually they start saying I'm nothing.

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
When you're nothing then your actions are nothing,

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
which means that you could be mean, you could be rude, you could be whatever,

136
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but it doesn't matter because I'm worthless

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
so I'm going to treat everybody else worthless too.

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
A lot of times people that are really insulting to others,

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
deep down inside they actually have no respect for themselves.

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
They have a deep worthlessness within themselves

141
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and they project that on others.

142
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The Quran makes me feel that I'm worth something.

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm worth enough of a miracle that all the angels were commanded to do sajda.

144
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm worth enough that Allah says,

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We honored all children of Adam, which means Allah Himself honored me.

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Which means Allah sees me as worth something.

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I shouldn't see myself as worthless.

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Loneliness, you know, nobody loves me, nobody understands me, nobody listens to me.

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's like I don't even exist, etc. etc.

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well we're the religion of Ibrahim, alayhis-salam.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't think there was anybody who was more lonely than Ibrahim, alayhis-salam.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But Allah gave him his company, didn't He?

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What a have Allah and Ibrahim a Khalilah.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Right? So we don't actually know what true loneliness in the end

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
will actually never be loneliness for a believer.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
They'll still have someone and doesn't mean that you don't need anybody in you.

157
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I have Allah, I don't need anyone.

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm like Ibrahim, alayhis-salam. I don't need you.

159
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No, no, no. Even Musa, alayhis-salam needed Harun.

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Right? He asked for Harun. He didn't say I'm going to go do this alone.

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But at least you know how to cope with loneliness.

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
At least you know how to work through loneliness because of the tazkiyah of the Quran.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Then greed, of course. We all want more. Let's be honest.

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's a car you don't have that you like.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There's a house that you drive by, you drive a little slowly.

166
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And then go.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You know, there's a job that you might like.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There's a, you know, we have greed. We have some things that we want that we don't have.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But that's kept under control.

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And whoever can be protected from the greed they have inside them.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Meaning it's there but it's not taking over you.

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right? It's being controlled.

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The same way Allah says in another place, for example,

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Allah put explosive content inside us.

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And He also put inside us the ability to protect us from that explosive content.

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Fujur means sin, but fujur actually comes from infijar, which means explosion.

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Fajr is called fajr because the light explodes.

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Right? So there's, my anger is explosive.

179
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
My jealousy is explosive. My desires are explosive.

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
My materialism can be explosive. All this stuff is explosive, man.

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It can take over. It can blow up.

182
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But Allah gave us protective mechanisms to keep it under control.

183
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And that's what the revelation does. It starts putting a check on these things.

184
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So now I mentioned these things when I say that they will not wish for death

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
because of what their hands prioritized.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Some of these things, greed, jealousy, you know, status, you know, your own pride,

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
even I'm adding other things, heedlessness, they become priority.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They take over somebody's life.

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And then when that happens, the religion, the Deen of Allah, becomes secondary.

190
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The Deen of Allah is only going to be practiced when it doesn't get in the way of my own priorities.

191
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
My priorities are first, the religion is second.

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So an easy example would be, for example, you're in university, you're on campus,

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
it's time for the prayer, and you're hanging out with a bunch of friends.

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Right? And you're like, you know it's got to use time for prayer,

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
but most of your friends are non-Muslim.

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So if you're going to go pray, then they're going to look at you funny.

197
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
They're going to say something, don't blow up the library, you know, nine, nine.

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay?

199
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And you're like, I don't want to hear those comments, so you know what, I'm just not going to pray.

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Not this time. I'll delay it.

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Now the thing is, in that moment, what did you prioritize?

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You prioritized your, the preservation of your dignity, right?

203
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Because you thought you'll preserve your dignity, you won't have to hear those comments, right?

204
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You won't have to hear that ridicule, or you won't have to hear their criticisms later on,

205
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and you saved yourself from that.

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You put that as a priority.

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
People's opinion of you became a priority over what Allah said.

208
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Some people asked the question, it was in the comments.

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I mentioned that there's the letter of the law and the spirit of the law,

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and there's the letter of the hijab, and there's the spirit of the hijab.

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And I did mention the spirit of the hijab, and people were like, what's the spirit?

212
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's the spirit?

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I've given long lectures on surat al-Nur and the ayah of hijab, but I will tell you guys,

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
because I like Stuttgart, so I'll tell you briefly.

215
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Allah describes in the Quran that a female, the way Allah made,

216
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I didn't say this, just in the Quran, take it up with Allah, okay?

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Allah says,

218
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The baby girl is described as someone who is decorated in jewelry.

219
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Young female, a little baby girl, but she already has a desire to be beautiful.

220
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The boy never puts on a shirt and says, look at my shirt.

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Dad, look at my shirt.

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But a little girl, you put on anything on her, you put on a rubber band on her wrist,

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
you put on a necklace made of paper, you put on anything, what's she gonna do?

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Say something, say something.

225
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And you just tell, he looks a pradia.

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I know.

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Allah put inside the male something.

228
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He put inside the male the desire to look at beauty.

229
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't have to convince you of this, you already know.

230
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You're like, somebody's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

231
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes, you do.

232
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He put inside the male the desire to look at beauty.

233
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He put inside the female the desire to look beautiful.

234
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He put it in her from the early ages.

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Allah put that in her fitrah.

236
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Now, Surah An-Nur, where Allah describes the head covering,

237
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Allah describes that men must guard their eyes.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They must guard their eyes.

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why? Because the thing that men get the most pleasure out of is looking at beauty.

240
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And the proof of that is in all of the online and media industries

241
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
that attract the eyes of men towards female beauty in the worst ways.

242
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And those industries make billions, if not trillions of dollars,

243
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
all because of these that men have.

244
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You know that, right?

245
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Like the proof, there's trillions of dollars of proof of something Allah has said.

246
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay?

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
On the flip side, Allah put a desire in women not to,

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
even though they want to look at beauty,

249
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
but they have a much stronger desire than looking,

250
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
what's the stronger desire for them?

251
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
To look beautiful.

252
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And there are trillions of dollars of investment in the makeup industry,

253
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
the fashion industry, the modeling industry,

254
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
the advertising industries across the planet

255
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
that are evidence to that fact that Allah mentions in Surah An-Nur.

256
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He mentions, these are facts,

257
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that human beings are living evidence of it every day.

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Economies, entire gigantic economies are evidence of this.

259
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
If you know people that work in social media

260
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and they work in social media advertising,

261
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
they know about Google Trends and the social media trend, video trends,

262
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
you know what I'm talking about.

263
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

264
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Now, having said that, the thing that men desire the most,

265
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
they have to control it if they have to keep the light in their heart.

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So men were told what?

267
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Lower your eyes.

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Women were told, and when women are told lower your eyes,

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
that's way easier for women.

270
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's like, whatever.

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
One in 10,000 men, they're like, oh.

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Otherwise, men, it's not one in 10,000 women.

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Women don't have major fit now when they're walking in an area

274
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
where they don't have a lot of money.

275
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They don't have a lot of money.

276
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
They don't have a lot of money.

277
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
They don't have a lot of money.

278
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Women don't have major fit now when they're walking in an airport.

279
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Everyone in a thousand men.

280
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Sometimes, some use of light type, you know, situation.

281
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They're like, oh, okay.

282
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But men,

283
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
As tak fir la, as tak fir la, as tak fir la, as tak fir la, as tak fir la.

284
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Different problem.

285
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Different, but what is the hardest thing for a female?

286
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
As hard it is for a man to lower his eyes.

287
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You know what's equally hard for her?

288
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Not to look pretty.

289
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's the hardest thing for her.

290
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It is so hard for her.

291
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you want to understand how hard it is for her,

292
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
it's as hard as it is for you to what?

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Lower your eyes.

294
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You know how every second you have to fight that?

295
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Every minute, you're like, alhamdulillah.

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I finished the lower eyes problem.

297
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Now I used to have that problem last year.

298
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I no longer have that problem anymore.

299
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's on autopilot.

300
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Is it ever on autopilot?

301
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
No, you have to guard it every single time.

302
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Guess what women have to go through?

303
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The desire to look beautiful doesn't go away.

304
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
They see another woman with beautifully hair done.

305
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
They're like, she's got nothing on my hair.

306
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
My hair is so much nicer under the sejab, though.

307
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And every time they see a woman with beautiful hair,

308
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
with her looks,

309
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and they're like, oh my God,

310
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I can show this so much better than she can.

311
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
She didn't even know.

312
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And it's killing them because it's all hidden.

313
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's hidden all the time.

314
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And it's like, I look so ugly.

315
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I look so ugly right now.

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And they get to, they're not even that pretty.

317
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And people think they're pretty.

318
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
People don't even know.

319
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm so much prettier.

320
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And there's this deep down inside struggle.

321
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And Allah says, yeah, you're going to control that one.

322
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You're going to control that one.

323
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
In order to what?

324
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
To keep the light in your heart.

325
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
To keep the light in your heart.

326
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The strongest impulse of men

327
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
that will destroy the state of their heart is that.

328
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And the strongest impulse for women

329
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that will destroy the state of their heart is that

330
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
this was about protecting their hearts.

331
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's actually what it was.

332
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's the Quran.

333
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We say, oh, it's far, it's far.

334
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Hold on.

335
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How did the Quran talk about it?

336
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Why is it in surah al-Nur?

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Why isn't the surah that protects the Nur inside the heart?

338
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why is it there?

339
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why is it talked about like this?

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Anyway, that's not my subject, but I'm just saying.

341
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But imagine, if that's, for some people,

342
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
they can't wish, how can they wish for meeting with Allah

343
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
when their desire, their other priorities

344
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
became more important.

345
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And you know what happens then?

346
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
If I took me in on a bit of the kitabi, what I could for a bit of it.

347
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
My desire to look, or my desire on the female side

348
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
to look beautiful was too strong.

349
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I couldn't control it.

350
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Now I'm going to say, you know what?

351
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Just because I don't do it doesn't mean I'm not a good believer.

352
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm really spiritual, you know.

353
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And I'm going to make lots of Instagram posts about

354
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
how I fast on Monday and Thursday

355
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and how I do tahajjud and how I do this and how I do that.

356
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And you know, who are you telling this to? Instagram?

357
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Who needs to hear this?

358
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Who needs to hear Allah SWT?

359
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Do I need to broadcast? How many enough did I pray?

360
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
How much I fasted? What sadaqa I did?

361
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What zikr I did?

362
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What naa, this is just you know something deep inside.

363
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You know that you're doing something that's not okay

364
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and you're trying to tell yourself,

365
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
but at least I'm doing so much other good.

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't judge me. Don't judge me.

367
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I said don't judge me.

368
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Nobody's judging you, but actually deep down inside

369
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
you can't help but also judge yourself.

370
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
بَلِ الْإِنْسَانُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيْعَ

371
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
A human being has full view of their own selves.

372
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No one has to judge you.

373
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You have to judge yourself.

374
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And you should judge yourself.

375
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And this new nonsense,

376
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
be merciful to yourself.

377
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Give yourself room to be human.

378
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's okay.

379
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's okay.

380
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That it's okay is so, the Quran's expression for that is

381
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
سَوْوَلَتْ لَكُمْ عَنْفُسُكُمْ عَمْرَى

382
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You made something convenient for yourselves.

383
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You said brothers made something convenient for themselves.

384
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's okay.

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Obviously, Dad doesn't love us.

386
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's okay if we just take one, we're not killing all the brothers,

387
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
we're just killing one of them.

388
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And we're going to be good after that.

389
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
سَوْوَلَتْ لَكُمْ عَنْفُسُكُمْ عَمْرَى

390
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You know, this is actually something that we have to really,

391
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
really learn about.

392
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
قَدَّ تَقْدِيمُ الْأَيدْ

393
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What is it that we are prioritizing?

394
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Is it that impulse that is a bigger priority than the word of Allah?

395
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
For men or for women?

396
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What is keeping me from praying?

397
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What's keeping me from giving up the haram money that I'm making?

398
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What's keeping me?

399
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What's keeping me from lying?

400
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What's keeping me from giving the money that I owe?

401
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
To I borrowed somebody's money, I didn't give it back.

402
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
What's keeping me from giving back that money?

403
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Something else became a priority over the word of Allah

404
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and those are the kinds of people who will never wish to meet with Allah.

405
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
They can't. How can they?

406
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
How can they?

407
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
وَدَا يَتَمَنَّا وُنَّا

408
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
وُعَبَدَنْ بِمَا قَدَّمَدْ اَيْدِيمِ

409
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
By the way, those kinds of people,

410
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
when they have that, it's called cognitive dissonance,

411
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
meaning they're believers, but they prioritize the wrong thing

412
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and they know they're violating the word of Allah.

413
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You know what they do then?

414
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The Quran is so accurate.

415
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You know what they do?

416
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
They talk a lot about the mercy of Allah.

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Those people talk a lot about how Allah forgives,

418
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
how Allah is merciful, how Allah is so loving,

419
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
how Allah is so kind, how Allah knows what you're going through.

420
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Allah is for... Why?

421
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Because there's another side to your relationship with Allah

422
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
that they don't want to deal with.

423
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You know what that side is?

424
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You're going to stand in front of Allah.

425
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You're going to explain yourself what you did, what you did.

426
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I don't want to deal with that part of it.

427
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I want to deal with Allah is my friend.

428
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
What did I say?

429
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
قُلْ يَا يُهَلَّتِنْهَا دُوْ إِنْزَعَنْتُمْ

430
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
أَنَّكُمْ أَوْ لِيَا أُولِ اللَّهِ

431
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
مِنْ دُونِ النَّاسْ بَتَمَنَّا وُلْمَوتِنْ كُدُمْ صَدِقْرِينْ

432
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Why do they think they're friends with Allah?

433
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Because if you're friends, Allah is always going to be okay with me.

434
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm going to be saved.

435
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Allah is merciful.

436
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Allah is loving.

437
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Allah is guaranteeing me Jannah.

438
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That's because the wrong priorities.

439
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's the wrong priorities that say, I'm going to look at one dimension of my relationship with God, not the other.

440
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Not the other.

441
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And understand from this the Christian concept of God is God is love.

442
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Right?

443
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
For the Israelites, the God is the savior of the Israelites.

444
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
He's the God of Israel.

445
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Actually, he's the God of Israel.

446
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
For Muslims, Allah is many names at the same time.

447
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So he loves us more than we can love ourselves.

448
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
He can judge us more than anybody else can judge us.

449
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He can hold us responsible, accountable more than anybody else can.

450
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's not one relationship.

451
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's multiple relationships.

452
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We don't get to pick one of them and say, I'm going to ignore the others because of our own issues.

453
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So what we do is we, because we have our own issues, we hold on to some names of Allah and forget other names of Allah.

454
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And that's exactly what they did in Awliya.

455
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We did not do it without people.

456
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We hope that death will come to the truthful.

457
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
We hope that it will never come to them.

458
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And Allah knows who the wrongdoers are.

459
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Allah knows the wrong you're doing.

460
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Allah knows fully well.

461
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You see how interrogative that is?

462
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What a precise surgical response that is from Allah.

463
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Now, this is a scary picture.

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But okay.

465
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Thank you, Lean.

466
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Okay, let's see why that's scary.

467
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Here's what's coming up in the next episode and this deeper look of Surat Al-Jumu'ah.

468
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
A'mal means to do something and fi'il also means to do something.

469
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But when you do something without thinking about it, it's a fi'il.

470
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So any action can be a fi'il.

471
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Breathing right now for me is a fi'il.

472
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
When I open my eyes and I see you guys, that's a fi'il.

473
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But if I choose one person to stare at, then that would be a amal.

474
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Because it's a conscious act.

475
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So amal includes intent.

476
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Fi'il does not include intent necessarily, but amal absolutely includes intent.

477
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So Allah is saying, He will inform you of the things you did intently, knowingly, consciously.

478
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Okay?

479
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Now we're coming to the most exciting part before the break.

480
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I need five minutes, guys.

481
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Is that okay?

482
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Five minutes.

483
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Okay.

484
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We've finished two sections of the Surah today.

485
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And I'm going to give you a review of Section 1.

486
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Section 1 was like this.

487
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Everything in the skies and the earth does to speed.

488
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You sabbihulillahimafi al-samawati wumafil ard.

489
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You remember that?

490
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Then He was the king.

491
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Al-malik, then al-Quddus, then al-Azeez, then al-Hakeem.

492
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Then Allah said, He sent to you.
