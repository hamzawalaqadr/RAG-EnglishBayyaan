0	7520	What does Allah say is an ayah in the Quran? History is an ayah. The mountain is an ayah.
7520	12800	The sky is an ayah. The animal is an ayah. My body is an ayah. What's going on inside
12800	20560	my chest is an ayah. All lived experience is a set of what? Ayat. And each one of them
20560	32320	becomes valuable because they are ayat of the king. Allah is so powerful he doesn't have to become
32320	38080	visible in how he exerts his power. Lotiful limayasha. He's subtle in how he does things,
38080	44880	delicate in how he does things, nearly unnoticed in how he does things. You know? And some things
44880	49440	is very obvious and some things is very delicate and invisible and that's actually one of the great
49440	57200	manifestations of the might of Allah Azza wa Jad. Now monuments and wealth. You know Allah says
57200	58800	about himself, Allah says,
61200	69600	We wanted to show Ibrahim A.S. the symbols of Allah's kingdom. Show him the signs of Allah's kingdom.
69600	71920	Allah asks the question to the disbelievers,
72400	80880	Do they have any signs of their empire? I'd like to see what portion of the empire do they have?
80880	85120	What control do they have? And if they had something they wouldn't give it to anybody else.
85120	89920	I was also thinking about how symbols of kingdoms are really important. You remember the story of
89920	95440	Yusuf A.S. when the cup was taken? Why was the cup important? It could have been any cup like
95440	98720	from a water cooler. It wouldn't have been a problem. It was the king's cup.
102880	108720	Because now that represents something very high value because it's associated with the kingdom.
109520	116480	So you know why this is an important thing for Quran students? The cup is a symbol of the kingdom
116480	124720	which is what gives it a lot of value, isn't it? Now that means the word for symbol in Arabic is
124720	132320	Aya. I'll say that again. The word for symbol is what? Aya. So it has value because it's an
132320	141280	Aya of the kingdom. What does Allah say is an Aya in the Quran? History is an Aya. The mountain is an
141280	147840	Aya. The sky is an Aya. The animal is an Aya. My body is an Aya. What's going on inside my chest is an
147840	155840	Aya. All lived experience is a set of what? Ayaat. And each one of them becomes valuable
156640	164560	because they are Ayaat of the king. So there are two kinds of Ayaats in the Quran. There are Ayaat
164560	170720	all around us and there are Ayaat of his revelation. But they both go, they are valuable because they
170720	177600	are Ayaat of the king. Just like the king of the cup of the king and the surah. Allah says
177840	189600	If you owned the treasures of Allah's Rahma, if you had any authority over them, you would have held
189600	194480	them back. Meaning Allah's kingdom is so vast. You know when you see a prosperous kingdom,
194480	201680	everybody's living well. You know some nations in the world are so wealthy that they just give money
201680	207680	to just everybody. Just wealth upon wealth. Nobody's poor and everybody's living large
207680	212160	because the kingdom has just too much to give. They just give and give and give. Some small
212160	216800	nations in the world that have massive natural resources and things like that. They do that.
217920	224000	So the idea is a kingdom that has the ability to give is more generous and just in the way that Allah
224000	228640	provides it is to all of his creation is a manifestation of Allah's kingdom. Okay.
229200	234960	It's also interesting again symbols of kingdom. I'm highlighting this because it's one of the most
234960	240720	important things that tell us about a kingdom. Allah even mentions a woman who was a queen.
241840	247440	Who was that? Sabah, you know Shiva. What does he say about her?
247440	254480	Inni wajattu imraatan tamlikuhum. I found a woman that rules over them. You know and what did he
254560	259600	say about her? He said wa utiyat bin kulli shay'in walaha ashun'a'zim. She has all kinds of things
259600	266560	and she has a great throne. What was the symbol of her kingdom? So you notice a theme now in the
266560	271040	Quran when Allah mentions kingdom. One of the things you notice about kingdoms are its symbols,
271920	279520	the marks of that kingdom. Okay. The right to rule. Who is the rightful king? In the story of
279680	284880	Talut and Jalut, the Israelites came to their prophet and said we need a king because we need to fight
284880	289120	in the path of Allah. Who will be the rightful king? Their prophet told them
293680	299840	The sign of him being the legitimate king is this cart will come back. That's a long story but
299840	305200	it's a really fun story actually in Jewish history that Allah refers to in the Quran because
305200	311520	the Quran is actually very full of Jewish history. There's lots of accounts of Jewish history in the
311520	317120	Quran and there's a lot of interplay between the Old Testament and the Quran. Right. So but anyway,
317120	321360	I won't go there but I will tell you one thing about Allah SWT. I told you kings
322240	328800	all often have to claim why they are the rightful king and they have to be declared the rightful
328800	334480	king and there has to be some kind of inauguration ceremony that makes it official that this is the
335200	340480	rightful king. You understand? And if that doesn't happen then they haven't earned their right to the
340480	345440	throne or if somebody challenges their right to the throne. Is there anyone that's going to
345440	349120	challenge Allah's right to his absh? Allah says,
352960	361360	How great, how high Allah is the rightful king. Meaning originally Allah has the ultimate right
361360	366720	of kingdom. He didn't get it from somewhere and no one can take it from him. That is originally his.
368400	373840	Then of course another piece of his important symbolism that has to do with kingship
374400	381040	is the history of a kingdom. Like for example, a great empire always talks about its monuments
381040	386320	and what they did in the past and their victories and their great ancestors and all that kind of
386320	395280	stuff. Allah says we had given them great empire. This idea of reference to going back. Every nation
395840	401920	teaches their children about its history. The empire must teach about the history because they
401920	407200	have to know what greatness they came from, what they belong to. And of course every nation tries to
407200	415680	tell their children and their next generations a soft version of their history. A stronger version
416000	421200	even if they have bad chapters in their history or embarrassing moments in their history or losses
421200	426080	in their history. They'll try to cover that part and highlight the juicy good parts in their history.
426080	430560	So you get the history you learn in school. It doesn't matter which country you come from.
430560	436000	The history you learn from in school is different from actual history because it's more propaganda
436000	441840	than history, actual, right? But history is a really important part of understanding kingdom.
442480	450160	Of course, has Allah in the Quran described the history of his kingdom? He has actually
450720	454960	from the very beginning. How he created the skies and the earth. How he brought Adam
454960	459040	alayhi salam to this world and how he has ruled over humanity from the beginning.
460320	466560	And it's centralized power. A kingdom cannot be considered a kingdom if power isn't centralized.
466640	472480	And of course Allah mentions biyadihi malakutukundi shayt. In his hand alone is the kingdom of everything.
473040	477680	It's ability to protect those in its realm. I love this ayah. Actually this is all one ayah.
478240	483440	How can you be a kingdom if you can't protect your people? You can't. Well, who are you Jeeb?
484160	489840	He's the one who offers protection. And then how can you protect your people? Not only should you
489840	494560	be able to protect your people, when you go after the enemy, the enemy cannot protect themselves.
497520	503200	And when this kingdom attacks, nobody can fight back. They can't withstand.
504000	509440	The ability to put down rebellion. Like you know in the case of Dhul-Qarnayn who was a king.
510480	515600	In his story, Allah Azza wa Jalla mentions that when he saw people that he was going to rule,
515600	519760	he said whoever does wrong, we're going to punish them. We're going to deal with them.
521120	524560	Allah himself then describes himself how he deals with rebellions.
526960	534160	Do they own the kingdom of the skies and the earth and whatever's in between?
534160	537360	Are they going to try to climb up through the ranks of the skies?
542480	547600	How many armies have there been that I've already annihilated of people who thought that they can
547600	553120	compete with me? Like Allah has put down rebellions in history before. We call them ruins of ancient
553120	559680	nations. That's Allah putting down rebellions. The ability to take care of its subjects like
559680	564080	You know the ayah?
566880	569440	Every day, everybody's asking him for something.
573040	577360	You know the king used to have a court and people used to walk in, oh great king, I haven't had
577360	581280	a chicken sandwich for five days, please give me a chicken sandwich. And they would come and beg
581280	586560	the king and the king would give them this land and give them this chicken sandwich or whatever you
586560	592000	give them. You know people come and beg the king and the king gives and then the king is running out
592000	598560	of money. He's running out the budget is bad. Now the king is not giving, the king is taking. He's like
598560	604880	oh collect tax, we already collect the tax, collect tax again. This you know change the season,
604880	610080	collect the tax again, take more from the people. So actually people think the king is the one that
610080	616240	gives, in this world the king does mostly what? Taking. The king does more taking than giving.
624400	630000	My heart is begging him for the next beat. My eyes are begging him for the next moment of moisture
630000	636880	in the eyes so they don't dry out. My veins are begging him to remain you know to keep blood
636880	643920	coursing through them. Every cell is begging him. Every every atom is begging him for its existence
643920	649280	constantly begging across all of existence and every day he's responding to those needs.
651680	656800	So this is the ability of him to take care of his subjects but of course a kingdom is known by its laws.
657920	665200	Any empire, any government is known by its unique laws. Like I don't get enough of mentioning this
665200	672080	example because I'm traumatized by the example. I went to Singapore one time and Singapore is
672080	678000	a really interesting country. You can't chew gum in Singapore on the street. You get arrested.
679120	683360	Yeah, can't chew gum. Don't do it up, don't do it. Just don't do it. Okay.
684320	690400	Anyway so what happened was it was summer, it was very moist so I had some bug spray. You know the
690400	697040	bug spray? I had a little bit of bug spray with me and a cream and when we landed the plane in
697040	700240	Singapore you know the flight attendant that says you can take your seatbelt off blah blah blah.
701200	705520	And welcome to Singapore. If you are found in possession of any illegal drugs you will be given
705520	713680	the death penalty. Enjoy your stay in Singapore. I took my bug spray. One of my employees was working
713760	724000	with me. I was like you carry this. A kingdom is known by its what? Laws. A government is known by
724000	732400	its laws. It's unique laws. Right? Does Allah also give us laws? Yeah. And a king like even the story
732400	737040	of kingdoms in the Quran like Yusuf A.S. wanted to he was a minister but he wasn't the king.
738000	743200	He wasn't the king so he wanted to keep his brother but his brother didn't have the proper paperwork.
743760	750080	He didn't have a visa for the kingdom. He didn't he didn't have any citizenship or anything. He was
750080	756560	actually a he was visitor visa you know refugee status so he couldn't keep him so he had to come
756560	764240	up with a way of getting him arrested and Allah says there was no way for him to keep him in the law
764240	770160	of the king because according to the law he couldn't keep his brother right and but the law is not
770160	776080	being made by Yusuf A.S. The law is being made by who? The king. That's the higher authority.
777600	784080	Kings also engage in war. Kingdoms engage in war and when they engage in war
785600	788800	Sheba makes a commentary about kings and what they do. She says
791920	794960	when kings come into a town they violate that town
795760	800640	and they take the noble people of that town and humiliate them.
802000	807360	They do that. In fact they engage in oppression basically. Allah the king of kings he also does
807360	813200	war but he never goes after anyone who is not what?
814240	817280	He's never the only people.
817840	825040	Is anyone going to be destroyed except the wrongdoers? Except the criminals?
825600	832000	No one but the criminals. When kings take over do only criminals get killed or civilians
832720	837760	stand by innocent people? Everybody gets killed. In fact if you were loyal to the previous government
837760	844640	you get killed. As-sulullah A.S. takes over Makkah. What's the policy? Kill everyone?
845600	849920	Kill all the people who fought you at Badr? If you meet someone who met you in battle before
850480	856320	take their head off? Is that the policy? No. I will say to you what my brother Yusuf said to his
856320	859920	brother. That the thiriba aleikum wa-l-yawm no harm will come on you today.
861440	868160	Allah is a different kind of king and he sends his messengers to execute Allah's style of kingdom.
868720	872160	Not the style of kingdom that happens in the earth but a heavenly kingdom.
872800	880320	Okay. Anyway so I'm gonna have to stop here. There's so much to do but I will leave you with
880320	886640	one juicy thing because I can do the juicy stuff. The next name of Allah we're gonna study is what?
887920	899440	Al-Quddus. Al-Quddus has two layers of study. The two layers of study are what does the word
899440	904480	mean in Arabic and how is it used in the Arabic language and how is it used in the Quran? So Arabic
904480	911120	and the Quran that's one layer of study but the other layer of study is actually this word is very
911120	918000	important in Biblical studies. So in the study of the Bible in the Hebrew Bible this word is really
918000	924400	really important and we're gonna have to look at why it was important to them also. Why is it important
924400	930720	to study that or know that because the Quran is actually speaking to multiple audiences and one
930720	937920	of its audiences is actually Jewish scholarship. But you may not know that now you know. One of the
937920	945680	direct audiences of the Quran is who? Not just the regular Jews even. Jewish scholarship. It was
945680	951680	actually communicating with them directly and a lot of the language in the Quran we understand it
951680	958480	from the Muslim perspective but when they heard it they heard it from a background they already had.
958480	963840	You understand? So if we understand the background that they had and then hear what the Quran is
963840	969920	saying it gives us deeper perspective on what's being said. But since we talked about politics
969920	978000	today I will leave you with the following concept. In kingdoms in the world there have there's always
978000	985120	been this idea that when a king takes power that he must have done something wrong to make that happen.
985760	992640	He must have killed somebody. He must have bribed. There's some corruption behind the scenes because
992640	998080	you don't move up unless you get your hands dirty. You have to have some blood on your hands to get
998080	1005280	there right? Either you came and you you know you know assassinated the the the current king
1005360	1010160	and you took power that way you seized power or you tried to climb up the ranks by way of
1010720	1016800	treachery and lying and cheating and scheming basically politics right? And that's how you
1016800	1021440	made it all the way to becoming kings. Scheming, scheming, scheming until you get to the top.
1021440	1026640	So when you think of people with power you think of corruption. It's been the history of the world
1026640	1032880	right? So power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely right? That's always been the
1032880	1038880	history of the world. So what and kings know that, rulers know that. So what they do then is they say
1038880	1044480	well we don't we can't keep our power if everybody thinks we're corrupt because eventually people
1044480	1050400	will rebel. They're not going to stay under our government. We have to find a way of making ourselves
1050400	1058480	look good no matter how dirty we are. So kings since ancient times came up with a formula.
1059440	1066880	We are going to use religion to make ourselves look good. So in ancient Egypt they're going to
1066880	1074000	have the priests and the the monks and the sages. They're going to say the gods have told us this
1074000	1080560	is the king. And since the people follow the religion now it's their religious obligation to
1080560	1087200	acknowledge the king. The Roman Empire once it adopts Christianity the Catholic Church is going
1087280	1095040	to endorse the king. The pope has an awkward conversation at the inaugural ceremony that you
1095040	1101520	may have seen the United Kingdom recently. Who's becoming loyal to who? It's a little confusing.
1102160	1110800	But the idea is this is a kingdom that is endorsed by God himself through the church or through the
1110880	1119520	priesthood or through the temple. This happened in ancient Indian kingdoms, Buddhist kingdoms,
1120240	1125120	the Chinese emperors. They'll have some sages or somebody that acknowledges them endorses them
1125120	1131040	because they get the religious people that follow the religious leadership. When the religious
1131040	1135760	leadership endorses the king then it becomes the religious thing to do to follow the king. And then
1135840	1141440	in many of these kingdoms they have prayers for the ruler. They'll pray for the rule. You know
1141440	1146240	God saved the queen, God saved the king. Right? They'll have those kinds of things. So what happens
1146240	1151520	is there's the world of politics and there's the world of religion and the religious people they're
1151520	1156480	considered holy. They're considered, I'll say that again, they're considered what? Holy. And the word
1156560	1165920	for holy people is mukaddas. The word is what? Mukaddas. So kingdoms stay stable because they
1165920	1173360	use the mukaddas class to declare themselves pure because they themselves are corrupt. They need
1173360	1180800	the mukaddas class to become legitimate. You understand? And these mukaddas class, these sacred
1180800	1187520	people, these holy people, these saints, these people, they're actually also behind the scenes,
1187520	1192560	what did they say? Hey, we're going to endorse you but we're going to need a sizable donation,
1192560	1203280	vis-a-bili, you know vis-a-bili us. You understand? Behind the scenes it's a backdoor deal. So actually
1203280	1209760	it's not just one is corrupt. The truth is what? Both of them are corrupt. What is this Sura going
1209760	1215600	to do? It's actually going to highlight the corruption on the mukaddas side. It's going to do that too.
1215600	1221600	But what is Allah telling us by these two names together? Al-Malik, Al-Quddus, Allah is the ultimate
1221600	1227040	king. Human beings when they think of a king, they think of someone who is dirty, corrupt. And then
1227040	1234240	they need to be cleansed by some other religious entity. And Allah says no, Allah is ultimate king
1234240	1240240	and Allah is ultimately pure all in one. And what did that teach the Muslims in their
1240240	1247040	understanding of the world? It taught them that in this religion, it's not that is a different world
1247040	1252000	and this is a different world. This is these people, these mukaddas people, these holy people,
1252000	1257680	they stay inside the monastery, they worship and pray, they think about God and the angels and
1257680	1262000	heaven and hell but they don't know what's happening in the real world. They don't know matters of
1262000	1267200	government, they just know matters of God. That's the mukaddas class. And then the kings know the
1267200	1272880	matters of politics and what's really happening in the world. So these are the pure people and these
1272880	1278400	are the people of the samawat and these are the people of the earth. You see?
1278400	1286480	You sabbihu lillahi, wa fith samawati, wa fith al-al-lil, al-malik, al-Quddus. It's incredible.
1286480	1291920	Like how everything is tying together now and Allah is teaching us actually in this religion
1291920	1298240	to become holier, to become pure. It doesn't mean you don't know what's happening in the real world
1299040	1304000	and just because you're engaged in politics and the real world doesn't mean you have to become dirty.
1304720	1310640	Both of those things coexist because our God is both al-malik and al-Quddus all in one.
1311520	1316320	You know this idea, leave to God, what is to God, leave to Caesar, what is to Caesar?
1317040	1324720	Allah is al-malik and al-Quddus, you see? So it's these few words, they're so profound in the
1326080	1331360	social philosophy, the political philosophy, the outlook that it creates and it makes
1331360	1337200	sophisticated believers. Now these people are revolutionary. Every religion before this
1337200	1343360	basically used religion as a tool to advance power. The holy right, the divine right of kings
1343360	1349840	and the Quran comes along and says, no, purity only belongs to Allah and absolute rule only belongs
1349840	1354400	to Allah. Everyone besides him is going to be imperfect. Everyone is going to be imperfect,
1354400	1361360	subhanAllah, al-malik, al-Quddus. I hope you guys enjoyed that video clip. My team and I have been
