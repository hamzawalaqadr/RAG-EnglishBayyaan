1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
What does Allah say is an ayah in the Quran? History is an ayah. The mountain is an ayah.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,800
The sky is an ayah. The animal is an ayah. My body is an ayah. What's going on inside

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,560
my chest is an ayah. All lived experience is a set of what? Ayat. And each one of them

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:32,320
becomes valuable because they are ayat of the king. Allah is so powerful he doesn't have to become

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,080
visible in how he exerts his power. Lotiful limayasha. He's subtle in how he does things,

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,880
delicate in how he does things, nearly unnoticed in how he does things. You know? And some things

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,440
is very obvious and some things is very delicate and invisible and that's actually one of the great

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,200
manifestations of the might of Allah Azza wa Jad. Now monuments and wealth. You know Allah says

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,800
about himself, Allah says,

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:09,600
We wanted to show Ibrahim A.S. the symbols of Allah's kingdom. Show him the signs of Allah's kingdom.

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,920
Allah asks the question to the disbelievers,

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,880
Do they have any signs of their empire? I'd like to see what portion of the empire do they have?

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,120
What control do they have? And if they had something they wouldn't give it to anybody else.

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,920
I was also thinking about how symbols of kingdoms are really important. You remember the story of

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,440
Yusuf A.S. when the cup was taken? Why was the cup important? It could have been any cup like

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,720
from a water cooler. It wouldn't have been a problem. It was the king's cup.

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,720
Because now that represents something very high value because it's associated with the kingdom.

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,480
So you know why this is an important thing for Quran students? The cup is a symbol of the kingdom

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:04,720
which is what gives it a lot of value, isn't it? Now that means the word for symbol in Arabic is

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:12,320
Aya. I'll say that again. The word for symbol is what? Aya. So it has value because it's an

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:21,280
Aya of the kingdom. What does Allah say is an Aya in the Quran? History is an Aya. The mountain is an

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,840
Aya. The sky is an Aya. The animal is an Aya. My body is an Aya. What's going on inside my chest is an

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Aya. All lived experience is a set of what? Ayaat. And each one of them becomes valuable

24
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,560
because they are Ayaat of the king. So there are two kinds of Ayaats in the Quran. There are Ayaat

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,720
all around us and there are Ayaat of his revelation. But they both go, they are valuable because they

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,600
are Ayaat of the king. Just like the king of the cup of the king and the surah. Allah says

27
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:09,600
If you owned the treasures of Allah's Rahma, if you had any authority over them, you would have held

28
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,480
them back. Meaning Allah's kingdom is so vast. You know when you see a prosperous kingdom,

29
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,680
everybody's living well. You know some nations in the world are so wealthy that they just give money

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,680
to just everybody. Just wealth upon wealth. Nobody's poor and everybody's living large

31
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,160
because the kingdom has just too much to give. They just give and give and give. Some small

32
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,800
nations in the world that have massive natural resources and things like that. They do that.

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,000
So the idea is a kingdom that has the ability to give is more generous and just in the way that Allah

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,640
provides it is to all of his creation is a manifestation of Allah's kingdom. Okay.

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,960
It's also interesting again symbols of kingdom. I'm highlighting this because it's one of the most

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,720
important things that tell us about a kingdom. Allah even mentions a woman who was a queen.

37
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,440
Who was that? Sabah, you know Shiva. What does he say about her?

38
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:14,480
Inni wajattu imraatan tamlikuhum. I found a woman that rules over them. You know and what did he

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
say about her? He said wa utiyat bin kulli shay'in walaha ashun'a'zim. She has all kinds of things

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,560
and she has a great throne. What was the symbol of her kingdom? So you notice a theme now in the

41
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,040
Quran when Allah mentions kingdom. One of the things you notice about kingdoms are its symbols,

42
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:39,520
the marks of that kingdom. Okay. The right to rule. Who is the rightful king? In the story of

43
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,880
Talut and Jalut, the Israelites came to their prophet and said we need a king because we need to fight

44
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,120
in the path of Allah. Who will be the rightful king? Their prophet told them

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,840
The sign of him being the legitimate king is this cart will come back. That's a long story but

46
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,200
it's a really fun story actually in Jewish history that Allah refers to in the Quran because

47
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,520
the Quran is actually very full of Jewish history. There's lots of accounts of Jewish history in the

48
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,120
Quran and there's a lot of interplay between the Old Testament and the Quran. Right. So but anyway,

49
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
I won't go there but I will tell you one thing about Allah SWT. I told you kings

50
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,800
all often have to claim why they are the rightful king and they have to be declared the rightful

51
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,480
king and there has to be some kind of inauguration ceremony that makes it official that this is the

52
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,480
rightful king. You understand? And if that doesn't happen then they haven't earned their right to the

53
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,440
throne or if somebody challenges their right to the throne. Is there anyone that's going to

54
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,120
challenge Allah's right to his absh? Allah says,

55
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:01,360
How great, how high Allah is the rightful king. Meaning originally Allah has the ultimate right

56
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,720
of kingdom. He didn't get it from somewhere and no one can take it from him. That is originally his.

57
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,840
Then of course another piece of his important symbolism that has to do with kingship

58
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,040
is the history of a kingdom. Like for example, a great empire always talks about its monuments

59
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,320
and what they did in the past and their victories and their great ancestors and all that kind of

60
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:35,280
stuff. Allah says we had given them great empire. This idea of reference to going back. Every nation

61
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,920
teaches their children about its history. The empire must teach about the history because they

62
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,200
have to know what greatness they came from, what they belong to. And of course every nation tries to

63
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:55,680
tell their children and their next generations a soft version of their history. A stronger version

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,200
even if they have bad chapters in their history or embarrassing moments in their history or losses

65
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,080
in their history. They'll try to cover that part and highlight the juicy good parts in their history.

66
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,560
So you get the history you learn in school. It doesn't matter which country you come from.

67
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,000
The history you learn from in school is different from actual history because it's more propaganda

68
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,840
than history, actual, right? But history is a really important part of understanding kingdom.

69
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:30,160
Of course, has Allah in the Quran described the history of his kingdom? He has actually

70
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,960
from the very beginning. How he created the skies and the earth. How he brought Adam

71
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,040
alayhi salam to this world and how he has ruled over humanity from the beginning.

72
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,560
And it's centralized power. A kingdom cannot be considered a kingdom if power isn't centralized.

73
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,480
And of course Allah mentions biyadihi malakutukundi shayt. In his hand alone is the kingdom of everything.

74
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,680
It's ability to protect those in its realm. I love this ayah. Actually this is all one ayah.

75
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,440
How can you be a kingdom if you can't protect your people? You can't. Well, who are you Jeeb?

76
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,840
He's the one who offers protection. And then how can you protect your people? Not only should you

77
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,560
be able to protect your people, when you go after the enemy, the enemy cannot protect themselves.

78
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,200
And when this kingdom attacks, nobody can fight back. They can't withstand.

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,440
The ability to put down rebellion. Like you know in the case of Dhul-Qarnayn who was a king.

80
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,600
In his story, Allah Azza wa Jalla mentions that when he saw people that he was going to rule,

81
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,760
he said whoever does wrong, we're going to punish them. We're going to deal with them.

82
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,560
Allah himself then describes himself how he deals with rebellions.

83
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:54,160
Do they own the kingdom of the skies and the earth and whatever's in between?

84
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,360
Are they going to try to climb up through the ranks of the skies?

85
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,600
How many armies have there been that I've already annihilated of people who thought that they can

86
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,120
compete with me? Like Allah has put down rebellions in history before. We call them ruins of ancient

87
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,680
nations. That's Allah putting down rebellions. The ability to take care of its subjects like

88
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,080
You know the ayah?

89
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
Every day, everybody's asking him for something.

90
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,360
You know the king used to have a court and people used to walk in, oh great king, I haven't had

91
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,280
a chicken sandwich for five days, please give me a chicken sandwich. And they would come and beg

92
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,560
the king and the king would give them this land and give them this chicken sandwich or whatever you

93
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,000
give them. You know people come and beg the king and the king gives and then the king is running out

94
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,560
of money. He's running out the budget is bad. Now the king is not giving, the king is taking. He's like

95
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,880
oh collect tax, we already collect the tax, collect tax again. This you know change the season,

96
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,080
collect the tax again, take more from the people. So actually people think the king is the one that

97
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,240
gives, in this world the king does mostly what? Taking. The king does more taking than giving.

98
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,000
My heart is begging him for the next beat. My eyes are begging him for the next moment of moisture

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,880
in the eyes so they don't dry out. My veins are begging him to remain you know to keep blood

100
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,920
coursing through them. Every cell is begging him. Every every atom is begging him for its existence

101
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,280
constantly begging across all of existence and every day he's responding to those needs.

102
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,800
So this is the ability of him to take care of his subjects but of course a kingdom is known by its laws.

103
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,200
Any empire, any government is known by its unique laws. Like I don't get enough of mentioning this

104
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,080
example because I'm traumatized by the example. I went to Singapore one time and Singapore is

105
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,000
a really interesting country. You can't chew gum in Singapore on the street. You get arrested.

106
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,360
Yeah, can't chew gum. Don't do it up, don't do it. Just don't do it. Okay.

107
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,400
Anyway so what happened was it was summer, it was very moist so I had some bug spray. You know the

108
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:37,040
bug spray? I had a little bit of bug spray with me and a cream and when we landed the plane in

109
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,240
Singapore you know the flight attendant that says you can take your seatbelt off blah blah blah.

110
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,520
And welcome to Singapore. If you are found in possession of any illegal drugs you will be given

111
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:53,680
the death penalty. Enjoy your stay in Singapore. I took my bug spray. One of my employees was working

112
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:04,000
with me. I was like you carry this. A kingdom is known by its what? Laws. A government is known by

113
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,400
its laws. It's unique laws. Right? Does Allah also give us laws? Yeah. And a king like even the story

114
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,040
of kingdoms in the Quran like Yusuf A.S. wanted to he was a minister but he wasn't the king.

115
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,200
He wasn't the king so he wanted to keep his brother but his brother didn't have the proper paperwork.

116
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,080
He didn't have a visa for the kingdom. He didn't he didn't have any citizenship or anything. He was

117
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,560
actually a he was visitor visa you know refugee status so he couldn't keep him so he had to come

118
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,240
up with a way of getting him arrested and Allah says there was no way for him to keep him in the law

119
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,160
of the king because according to the law he couldn't keep his brother right and but the law is not

120
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,080
being made by Yusuf A.S. The law is being made by who? The king. That's the higher authority.

121
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,080
Kings also engage in war. Kingdoms engage in war and when they engage in war

122
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,800
Sheba makes a commentary about kings and what they do. She says

123
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,960
when kings come into a town they violate that town

124
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,640
and they take the noble people of that town and humiliate them.

125
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,360
They do that. In fact they engage in oppression basically. Allah the king of kings he also does

126
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,200
war but he never goes after anyone who is not what?

127
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,280
He's never the only people.

128
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:45,040
Is anyone going to be destroyed except the wrongdoers? Except the criminals?

129
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,000
No one but the criminals. When kings take over do only criminals get killed or civilians

130
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,760
stand by innocent people? Everybody gets killed. In fact if you were loyal to the previous government

131
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,640
you get killed. As-sulullah A.S. takes over Makkah. What's the policy? Kill everyone?

132
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,920
Kill all the people who fought you at Badr? If you meet someone who met you in battle before

133
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,320
take their head off? Is that the policy? No. I will say to you what my brother Yusuf said to his

134
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
brother. That the thiriba aleikum wa-l-yawm no harm will come on you today.

135
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,160
Allah is a different kind of king and he sends his messengers to execute Allah's style of kingdom.

136
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,160
Not the style of kingdom that happens in the earth but a heavenly kingdom.

137
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,320
Okay. Anyway so I'm gonna have to stop here. There's so much to do but I will leave you with

138
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,640
one juicy thing because I can do the juicy stuff. The next name of Allah we're gonna study is what?

139
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:59,440
Al-Quddus. Al-Quddus has two layers of study. The two layers of study are what does the word

140
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,480
mean in Arabic and how is it used in the Arabic language and how is it used in the Quran? So Arabic

141
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,120
and the Quran that's one layer of study but the other layer of study is actually this word is very

142
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,000
important in Biblical studies. So in the study of the Bible in the Hebrew Bible this word is really

143
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,400
really important and we're gonna have to look at why it was important to them also. Why is it important

144
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,720
to study that or know that because the Quran is actually speaking to multiple audiences and one

145
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,920
of its audiences is actually Jewish scholarship. But you may not know that now you know. One of the

146
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,680
direct audiences of the Quran is who? Not just the regular Jews even. Jewish scholarship. It was

147
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,680
actually communicating with them directly and a lot of the language in the Quran we understand it

148
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,480
from the Muslim perspective but when they heard it they heard it from a background they already had.

149
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,840
You understand? So if we understand the background that they had and then hear what the Quran is

150
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,920
saying it gives us deeper perspective on what's being said. But since we talked about politics

151
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:18,000
today I will leave you with the following concept. In kingdoms in the world there have there's always

152
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,120
been this idea that when a king takes power that he must have done something wrong to make that happen.

153
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:32,640
He must have killed somebody. He must have bribed. There's some corruption behind the scenes because

154
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,080
you don't move up unless you get your hands dirty. You have to have some blood on your hands to get

155
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:45,280
there right? Either you came and you you know you know assassinated the the the current king

156
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,160
and you took power that way you seized power or you tried to climb up the ranks by way of

157
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,800
treachery and lying and cheating and scheming basically politics right? And that's how you

158
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,440
made it all the way to becoming kings. Scheming, scheming, scheming until you get to the top.

159
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,640
So when you think of people with power you think of corruption. It's been the history of the world

160
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,880
right? So power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely right? That's always been the

161
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,880
history of the world. So what and kings know that, rulers know that. So what they do then is they say

162
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,480
well we don't we can't keep our power if everybody thinks we're corrupt because eventually people

163
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,400
will rebel. They're not going to stay under our government. We have to find a way of making ourselves

164
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:38,480
look good no matter how dirty we are. So kings since ancient times came up with a formula.

165
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,880
We are going to use religion to make ourselves look good. So in ancient Egypt they're going to

166
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,000
have the priests and the the monks and the sages. They're going to say the gods have told us this

167
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,560
is the king. And since the people follow the religion now it's their religious obligation to

168
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:07,200
acknowledge the king. The Roman Empire once it adopts Christianity the Catholic Church is going

169
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:15,040
to endorse the king. The pope has an awkward conversation at the inaugural ceremony that you

170
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,520
may have seen the United Kingdom recently. Who's becoming loyal to who? It's a little confusing.

171
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:30,800
But the idea is this is a kingdom that is endorsed by God himself through the church or through the

172
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:39,520
priesthood or through the temple. This happened in ancient Indian kingdoms, Buddhist kingdoms,

173
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,120
the Chinese emperors. They'll have some sages or somebody that acknowledges them endorses them

174
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,040
because they get the religious people that follow the religious leadership. When the religious

175
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,760
leadership endorses the king then it becomes the religious thing to do to follow the king. And then

176
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,440
in many of these kingdoms they have prayers for the ruler. They'll pray for the rule. You know

177
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,240
God saved the queen, God saved the king. Right? They'll have those kinds of things. So what happens

178
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,520
is there's the world of politics and there's the world of religion and the religious people they're

179
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,480
considered holy. They're considered, I'll say that again, they're considered what? Holy. And the word

180
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:25,920
for holy people is mukaddas. The word is what? Mukaddas. So kingdoms stay stable because they

181
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:33,360
use the mukaddas class to declare themselves pure because they themselves are corrupt. They need

182
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,800
the mukaddas class to become legitimate. You understand? And these mukaddas class, these sacred

183
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,520
people, these holy people, these saints, these people, they're actually also behind the scenes,

184
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,560
what did they say? Hey, we're going to endorse you but we're going to need a sizable donation,

185
00:19:52,560 --> 00:20:03,280
vis-a-bili, you know vis-a-bili us. You understand? Behind the scenes it's a backdoor deal. So actually

186
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,760
it's not just one is corrupt. The truth is what? Both of them are corrupt. What is this Sura going

187
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,600
to do? It's actually going to highlight the corruption on the mukaddas side. It's going to do that too.

188
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,600
But what is Allah telling us by these two names together? Al-Malik, Al-Quddus, Allah is the ultimate

189
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,040
king. Human beings when they think of a king, they think of someone who is dirty, corrupt. And then

190
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:34,240
they need to be cleansed by some other religious entity. And Allah says no, Allah is ultimate king

191
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,240
and Allah is ultimately pure all in one. And what did that teach the Muslims in their

192
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,040
understanding of the world? It taught them that in this religion, it's not that is a different world

193
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,000
and this is a different world. This is these people, these mukaddas people, these holy people,

194
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,680
they stay inside the monastery, they worship and pray, they think about God and the angels and

195
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,000
heaven and hell but they don't know what's happening in the real world. They don't know matters of

196
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,200
government, they just know matters of God. That's the mukaddas class. And then the kings know the

197
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,880
matters of politics and what's really happening in the world. So these are the pure people and these

198
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,400
are the people of the samawat and these are the people of the earth. You see?

199
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:26,480
You sabbihu lillahi, wa fith samawati, wa fith al-al-lil, al-malik, al-Quddus. It's incredible.

200
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,920
Like how everything is tying together now and Allah is teaching us actually in this religion

201
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,240
to become holier, to become pure. It doesn't mean you don't know what's happening in the real world

202
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,000
and just because you're engaged in politics and the real world doesn't mean you have to become dirty.

203
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,640
Both of those things coexist because our God is both al-malik and al-Quddus all in one.

204
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,320
You know this idea, leave to God, what is to God, leave to Caesar, what is to Caesar?

205
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:04,720
Allah is al-malik and al-Quddus, you see? So it's these few words, they're so profound in the

206
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,360
social philosophy, the political philosophy, the outlook that it creates and it makes

207
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,200
sophisticated believers. Now these people are revolutionary. Every religion before this

208
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,360
basically used religion as a tool to advance power. The holy right, the divine right of kings

209
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,840
and the Quran comes along and says, no, purity only belongs to Allah and absolute rule only belongs

210
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,400
to Allah. Everyone besides him is going to be imperfect. Everyone is going to be imperfect,

211
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,360
subhanAllah, al-malik, al-Quddus. I hope you guys enjoyed that video clip. My team and I have been
