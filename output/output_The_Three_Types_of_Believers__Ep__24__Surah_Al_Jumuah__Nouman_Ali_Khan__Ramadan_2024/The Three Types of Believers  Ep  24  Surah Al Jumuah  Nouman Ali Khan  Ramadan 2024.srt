1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The power of a gathering, when people are gathered together and they're hearing ideas.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If they're hearing powerful ideas, if they're hearing powerful and there's no more,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the world does not have more powerful ideas than the Quran.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's the word of God, that's the word of Allah Himself.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If they were hearing these ideas week after week after week after week,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you don't think those people become powerful?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So all three things now come together, the solution was given in one,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the problem was described in two, and the practical steps now.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What must you do? That's now coming in this section, this remarkable section.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So let's begin with ayah number nine.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ya ayyuhal ladheena amanoo idhanoodiya dis-salat min yaumil jumaa

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Those of you who believe, idhanoodiya dis-salat when the call is made for the prayer,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
min yaumil jumaa as part of the day of Friday, min tab'idiyya.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So you can translate this on the day of Friday,

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but you can also translate this as from part of the day of Friday.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Because we're not being asked to pray all Friday,

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we're being asked to pray only a part of the Friday, so min tab'idiyya.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
fas'awiladiklilahi then rush to the remembrance of Allah.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
wazarul bay'a and leave the sale.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That all of you is better for you if in fact you truly know.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's the ayah that we're going to discuss.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The first thing I want you to note here is ya ayyuhal ladheena amanoo.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Those of you who claim to believe.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This phrase you should remind, remember always when you leave this phrase in the Quran,

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
it actually includes three groups of people.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I started the series with this word, wrapping it up with this too.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Madina had three kinds of believers.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The strongest believers, the...

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, haven't been tested yet believers?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And then the hypocrites and the middle category is being pulled towards the hypocrites

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and Allah is pulling them towards iman, but on the outside they all claim to believe.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So when Allah says ya ayyuhal ladheena amanoo, all of them are being addressed together.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
All of them are being addressed together.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And he says,

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
When the call is made,

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll stop there for a moment before we get to the prayer part.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The call being made is referring to the azan, right?

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The azan.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The word azan is not used in the Quran in the meaning of the azan the way we use it.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Or did the muazzin give the azan?

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Was the azan of Jumran salamate?

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Or was the azan of Maghrib called?

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We use the word azan for the prayer call.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The Quran doesn't use that term.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The Quran uses the word nida.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Culturally we kind of became accustomed to using the word azan.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And what's the difference between azan and nida?

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So I want you to understand that.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Azan actually means announcement.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Azan means announcement.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Nida means a call.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Nida means a call.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay?

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's the difference between an announcement and a call?

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If I make an announcement, I just want you to know something.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
When I call, what am I doing?

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm saying come here.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's a demand.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
An announcement just gives information.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But a call makes a demand.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A call makes a demand.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So now the prayer the azan that we give is actually called a call.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Now let's go through quickly.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's just go through just the opening of the azan.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Every part of the azan is actually a call.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay?

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And you have to see the qunaya in the call.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Remember qunaya?

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Saying something without saying something?

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The first part of the azan is Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Isn't it?

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Allah is greater.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Allah is greater.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The wrong translation is Allah is the greatest.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That would be Allahu Gual Akbar.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is not Afdal Tafdeen.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There's no Lamat Tariq on it.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
There's no Lamat Tafdeen on it.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is Allahu Akbar, which means Allah is greater.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In that phrase, there is a call.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hey, you're fixing your car right now.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You heard Allahu Akbar.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Allah is greater than the need to fix your car.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're having a sandwich right now.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Allahu Akbar.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Allah is greater than your need to add more ketchup and go for another sandwich.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Go towards the salar.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're in the middle of studying for your exam right now.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You heard Allahu Akbar.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Allah is greater than the need for your review for this exam.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In other words, there's a necessary comparison with anything you're doing to the call.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's the first thing.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
When you say,

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When you testify to this, it is as if Allah is saying those who accept this message,

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
those who prove that they accept this message,

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
just like you're called to Islam, you're being called to the prayer.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Actually.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The testimony, because we're already Muslim.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why do we need to hear,

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ashadu-Allah-Lah-Lah-Lal-Allah.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We're like,

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, I am more Muslim family,

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
or somebody became Muslim two years ago was like,

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, I did that two years ago.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why are you saying it every prayer, bro?

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ashadu-Allah-Lah-Lal-Allah.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I took the Shahada in front of the machine.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Everybody gave me a high five minute to clear and I hug.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I was all hooked out for three hours.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then they left me alone and nobody talks to me now.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Right.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The new Muslim story.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why am I hearing the Shahada over and over again?

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's as if the claim, this testimony, you need to prove it.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You need to prove the ultimate proof that you accepted this faith is actually the prayer.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's actually the prayer.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Where do we get this idea from?

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's actually spelled out in the Quran too.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
In Surah Al-Qiyamah in Surah number 75 Allah says,

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Fala Sadaqat Walaa Salla.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He says he didn't accept the truth and he didn't pray.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He didn't accept the truth and he didn't pray.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What does that mean?

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Had he accepted the truth,

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm going to pray it.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You find in Surah Al-Bakr something really interesting.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You remember before the Ka'bah,

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the Muslims used to pray towards Jerusalem.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Right?

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They used to pray towards Jerusalem.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And then Allah changed the direction.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When Allah changed the direction back towards the Ka'bah,

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
some of the Jewish community started making fun of the Muslims.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, what happened?

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You had the wrong address the whole time?

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So what happened to all those prayers you were praying in the wrong direction?

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Those don't count, huh?

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Allah says, Allah responds to this criticism.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And he says,

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Wa Ma Kaan Allahu Wa Ma Kaan Allahu Di Uli A'i Maanakum.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Allah will not waste your iman.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But they weren't saying, Allah will not waste your iman.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They were saying, Allah will waste your prayer.

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But Allah said, Allah will not waste your iman.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You use the word iman instead of using the word prayer.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Teaching us that to Allah, iman and prayer are one and the same.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
When you hear,

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ashadu Alla Ila Allaha Illa Allah,

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Ashadu Alla Muhammad Ar-Rasulullah,

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that is iman, isn't it?

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And iman should translate immediately to me as what?

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Prayer.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Should translate as prayer.

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hayya' ala s-salaa,

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I mean you can't get, that's not even Ken'ayah.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Come pray now.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You get it?

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's go.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But Hayya' ala al-Falah is really cool.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hayya' ala al-Falah.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Come to success.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We're going to see the word success here too, soon.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's a really interesting word, Falah.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Falah and Arabic is to break something.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So break the earth, break a rock.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And the farmer breaks the soil

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and plants the seed.

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And when the farmer finally breaks it again,

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
is when he's plucking his crop, when it's already,

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and he's breaking the soil and he's taking out,

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
it's called the harvest season,

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
at that time he's called the muflih.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's when he's called the muflih.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And that season is Falah season.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Falah season.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And like, for example, in Palestine,

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
there are certain people, they're known as the farmers,

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and that's actually even a tribal region, al-Falahin.

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Right, al-Falah, in Palestine, al-Falahin,

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
like they're farmers.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And they have that farming tradition.

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now the idea of al-Falah is come towards something

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
that will lead you to harvest season.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're planting, every sula, you're planting a seed,

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and you're going to pull that seed out on judgment day.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And every sula you're planting a seed,

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and you're going to lead to some kind of success

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
in this life and in the next.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Inna sula tataanhaa al-fahshaa'i wal-munkah.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Allah is actually calling you towards success.

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Which is pretty amazing.

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The adhan saying, come be successful.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Come be successful.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
People ask, like, I go to university,

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
it's really hard to pray, can I not pray?

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Can I just pray later?

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Like, at the end of the semester, make the whole semester up during the summer.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And then you wonder why you didn't pass any of your tests.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and help other sign up, even sponsor students for bayinatv.com

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
so we can create worldwide communities of students

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and are insha'Allah ta'ala spreading that in their own circles.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Thanks so much.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Allah says, come succeed.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're like, no, I want to fail.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Ha, ya'al fadaah.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Then He says, qad qamat as-sadaah.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The prayer is already in the Qama even.

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Qad qamat as-sadaah.

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The prayer is stood.

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Come on, get up.

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And even standing is really remarkable

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
because standing should remind us of ya'ul mul standing.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Right?

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So the entire adhan is actually a call.

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I wanted to just give you an appreciation of this word,

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
how that's different from an announcement.

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Of course, we see it as an announcement now, as an announcement for prayer,

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
but actually we should see it as a call for prayer.

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So ya'ayu al-adheena amanu idha nudiya.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's go to the second word now.

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Actually, before it goes to the second word, nudiya is a passive verb.

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Passive verbs mean you don't know who did it.

228
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So it's not when the caller calls, nadaa munad in this sadaa.

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's actually nudiya when the call is made.

230
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
When the call is made.

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You know what that means?

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That means it's irrelevant who made the call.

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If it's bilal who gave the adhan, go.

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If it's Allah that gave the adhan, go.

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If it's Abu Bakr gave the adhan, go.

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If it's Abu Dahl Ghafari who gave the adhan, go.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If it's a new Muslim, you just became Muslim two days ago

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and gave the adhan, go.

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you're in a, you know, Baghledesi neighborhood

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and you're not Baghledesi and you heard the adhan from a Baghledesi, go.

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Does it matter where the adhan came from?

242
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No.

243
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The only thing that matters is your call to the prayer.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You know what that does?

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The people that are going to lead the prayer,

246
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
the people that are going to be the congregation,

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
where they're from, who they are, none of that matters now.

248
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
All that matters is the call was made.

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Now some people could say, I'm going to go attend a Juma.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like I went to, when I was in Rome, it was Juma one of the days I was there, it was Juma.

251
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So I had to find a masjid to go pray Juma.

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And the khudbah was in Arabic, which was really cool.

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And the rest of the khudbah was in Italian.

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That was so cool.

255
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Also, I felt like I was watching something on Netflix or something.

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It was pretty epic.

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But I didn't understand, I mean I just, Alhamdulillah, the Arabic part I understood.

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But like the Italian part, I didn't understand a word.

259
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But people are like, yeah, and I was like,

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
but it doesn't matter.

261
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There's many times, when I was in Malaysia, I'll go attend a Juma in a masjid

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
where the khudbah is going on in Bahasa Malaya.

263
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't understand the language, but I'm sitting and listening.

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There were times in New York, I'm late for Salah or I need to go to a masjid,

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
but that masjid is too far.

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And it was actually on 2nd and 11th Avenue, there was a Bangla Dish masjid.

267
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And they gave the khudbah since the 1920s, I think.

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They're giving khudbah in Bangla. They still give khudbah in Bangla.

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's like, oh, I sit there, Kim and I sit there, and I just sit there, and I listen to the khudbah.

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No problem. Why?

271
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Because it doesn't matter where the call is coming from.

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're going to go because there's Juma. That's it.

273
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is an incredible thing that Allah did.

274
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because what happened in many different religions

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
is that the religion actually became very ethnic.

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Like even in America, there's a black church, there's a Spanish church,

277
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
there's a Guatemalaj, there's a Cuban church, there's this church, there's that church.

278
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
For the Muslims, you could have, okay, there's an Albanian community here.

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But this is not an Albanian masjid, this is just a masjid.

280
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There's no restriction on anybody coming,

281
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and you shouldn't be feeling like you're out of place, you're in Allah's house.

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's it. Allah's house feels like Allah's house.

283
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And this is a remarkable thing that Allah captured in the word Nudia.

284
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This is one of the most powerful features of Islam.

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I met a young man when I was 20 at the time.

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is a long time ago. The year was 1875.

287
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And this was in Brooklyn.

288
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I go to pray Juma at the masjid in Bedford, Brooklyn.

289
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I go to Imam's Salaaj's masjid, I go there maybe an hour before the Juma.

290
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Just sit there and recite some Quran.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm going to be there and I see this guy sitting there.

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He's just just by himself.

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm going to make some friends with this guy. I go to start talking to him.

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And he says, yeah, it's my first time.

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I was like, really? What were you doing before?

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And he said, well, I was studying.

297
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
First, I was born in a Christian family, but I decided to start studying the Bible.

298
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And then when I started studying the Bible, I felt like we're not following the Bible in the church.

299
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And so I decided that I'm going to take the Bible more seriously.

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then I looked up who actually studies the Bible in its original language.

301
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I found out it's the Jewish community.

302
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And New York has a lot of synagogues and, you know, temples and things like that, Jewish temples and stuff.

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So I joined a synagogue and I learned Hebrew for over two years.

304
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And I studied the Bible and he started doing this when he was 16 years old.

305
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He was now 18, 19 years old.

306
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Right?

307
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And he just started studying the Bible and he goes and I've been in the Jewish community a long time,

308
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
but they made it clear to let me know that I'm not truly Jewish because I'm converting.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Because I'm not from the children of Israel.

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And they made sure that I understand that different.

311
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I understood that I'm a Gentile.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I got that.

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's in the Bible.

314
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's how it is.

315
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And then one day I just kind of passed by this place and they were praying and I just decided to just,

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I didn't know what it was, but I thought it looked a little bit like the Jewish prayer

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
because the Jews also have Qiyam and Rukour.

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They have some of these things.

319
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So he joined the prayer and the musted.

320
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And he didn't even know what he's doing.

321
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He just joined it.

322
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And then he looked around and he saw black people.

323
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He saw Arabs.

324
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He saw brown people.

325
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He saw white people.

326
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He saw every color you can find in one row.

327
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And they're all saying, said, I'm to each other and they're all hanging out together.

328
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They're eating together.

329
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And he's just like, I don't, I don't, I mean, I've seen this kind of diversity at a train station.

330
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh, why is there this much?

331
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What kind of church is the church?

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
At least you got to have some, at least some similar color.

333
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
These people are from different cultures and different languages.

334
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The thing that brought him to Islam was how it was actually just the call is made.

335
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Everybody showed it.

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Wa a'a sareena minhum lamma yalhaqubiya.

337
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And that itself is a demonstration of the power, the might of Islam.

338
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Allah being Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem, it shows inside, like in every house of Allah.

339
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And as the more the world globalizes, right?

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The more diversity you see in every house of Allah, it's such an incredible thing.

341
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't think we realize how powerful that is.

342
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We don't even realize what we're sitting on.

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's so, so powerful.

344
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
This thing is so powerful that actually the Jum'ah became dangerous.

345
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The Jum'ah became dangerous because if the Imams can teach the people to connect with the Quran

346
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and see the world around them through the word of Allah,

347
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
they might start pointing out things that are wrong in society and not accept them.

348
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Or start challenging some things in society that are wrong.

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So what happened, for example, when the British took over India,

350
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
they wanted to control, the first thing they did is they wanted to control

351
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and change the system of education so the Indian Muslims will no longer study Arabic.

352
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And they replaced Arabic with English education.

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And over a couple of generations, for example, what they did with the Muslims in Algeria

354
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and Morocco and Tunisia, other places, what the French did is,

355
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
now Algerian youth know more French than they know Arabic.

356
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So you don't have to attack the Quran.

357
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You don't have to do that.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You just have to make sure that when Yatlu alayhim, ayaatihi is happening,

359
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
they're just sounds.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
They just become Himmari, yahmelu asfara.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So they don't process anything.

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And that way, you can have Jum'ah without having Jum'ah.

363
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You understand?

364
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So what if thousands of them are gathered together and they hear something,

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
they can't make any sense of it?

366
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And then in other places, what happened is, then the instructions were given,

367
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
we will tell you what to say.

368
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We're going to tell you what to say in the Friday sermon.

369
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You're going to talk about how you have to wear leather socks,

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
or how long your beard is supposed to be, or how high your pants are supposed to be,

371
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
or the benefits of the day of Friday,

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
or some story of this or a story of that.

373
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Don't talk about the Quran.

374
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If we find out you're talking about this surah,

375
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
if we find out you're talking about that ayaat, it's not going to be good for you.

376
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So the sermon got controlled.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The sermon that was supposed to unfiltered connect people directly with the word of Allah

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
was now, it was too powerful.

379
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The Khubbah is too powerful.

380
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's too, you know, people are coming and it has this divine power

381
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
that you don't have to make an announcement.

382
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You know, when I'm coming here for this program,

383
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I have to announce it on social media.

384
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I have to let you guys know.

385
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And we have to make sure that other people find out and there has to be some,

386
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
the local community has to send emails and maybe send WhatsApp messages

387
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
or blackmail your neighbor or something.

388
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't know.

389
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But does anybody need an announcement to come to Juma?

390
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Is there a weekly please come to Friday prayer?

391
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
No.

392
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And the people who are knowledgeable come, the people who are not knowledgeable come,

393
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the people who understand the language come,

394
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
the people who don't understand the language come,

395
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
the taxi driver comes, the taxi customer comes,

396
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
the restaurant owner comes, the restaurant customer comes,

397
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
the boss comes, the employee comes, everybody shows up.

398
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
On their end, no announcement.

399
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Every week.

400
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Every, and you know, the power of a gathering.

401
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
When people are gathered together and they're hearing ideas,

402
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
if they're hearing powerful ideas, if they're hearing powerful,

403
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and there's no more, the world does not have more powerful ideas than the Quran.

404
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's the word of God.

405
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's the word of Allah Himself.

406
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
If they were hearing these ideas week after week after week after week,

407
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
you don't think those people become powerful?

408
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You don't think those people become independent thinkers?

409
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They become analytical?

410
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
They develop the mindset of Ibrahim A.S. who questions everything around him?

411
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
They don't develop that?

412
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There's something so powerful about,

413
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
إذا نودي لصلاة من يوم الجوعة as a part of the day of Friday.

414
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This is not just this, this, I could be discussing with you,

415
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
there are a hadith, you can look them up yourself.

416
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I was going to make that part of this lecture today.

417
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There are a hadith about the rewards of coming early on the day of Friday.

418
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You know them.

419
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Why is the day of Friday so blessed?

420
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You know that stuff.

421
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You've heard that stuff a bajillion times.

422
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So I don't have to teach you that stuff because you already know it,

423
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and you can easily look it up.

424
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I want to talk to you about the dimension of Jumu'ah that's been forgotten.

425
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The immense power of the Jumu'ah of the Baa.

426
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It is a weekly convention of the Muslim community, and it's open.

427
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
نوديا also means that it allotted not your being called,

428
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
but since the call is open, even a non-Muslim walking by can sit in and listen in.

429
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll tell you, I wish I could tell you this is made up, it's not made up.

430
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I was in the West Indies, okay, in Jamaica actually, in Jamaica.

431
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It was an Islamic convention in Jamaica.

432
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And I met the grand mufti of the Jamaican Muslim community.

433
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And he's an Indian fellow, and he, crazy story,

434
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
he was born in a Hindu family in Jamaica,

435
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and his family wanted him to learn Hinduism.

436
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So they sent him to the capital of Hinduism.

437
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Where did they send him?

438
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
They sent him to India.

439
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They sent him to India, and he had this address to go to, to go study,

440
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and the door down from the Hindus was the Muslims,

441
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and he went to the wrong door.

442
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And there was, he did.

443
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He got the wrong directions, and he went inside the wrong door,

444
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
and there was Juma going on, he sat in, and he came back a mufti,

445
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and he's the mufti of West Indies Muslim community.

446
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Because the Juma is what?

447
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Is it an open invitation?

448
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Is it remarkable what Juma does?

449
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's incredible what it does.

450
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Anybody can sit in.

451
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I had a friend, I won't name him because he'll get embarrassed.

452
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He's non-Muslim.

453
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I was travelling with him one time, and we were in a Muslim country,

454
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and I was about to go to Friday prayer, and he said,

455
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
can I come?

456
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I was like, yeah, you can come.

457
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Come on.

458
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So he comes with me, he goes, is everybody gonna notice?

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I was like, you're wearing, I'm wearing a t-shirt.

460
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I was like, oh no.

461
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's summer in the Arab world.

462
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Everybody wearing a t-shirt, bro.

463
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He's like, they all look normal.

464
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I was like, prayer's starting.

465
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Just, what do I gotta do?

466
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Just sit here like everybody else.

467
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So he sits like everybody else.

468
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We're just sitting quiet.

469
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There's a bus going on in Arabic.

470
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
He doesn't understand anything that's going on,

471
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
but he's sitting there, and he just notices people come in,

472
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and they sit down.

473
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Nobody looks at anybody else.

474
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The people just respectfully sit down and listen,

475
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and then they all get up to pray, and then he joins the prayer.

476
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And he's like, well, how am I gonna pray?

477
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
How am I gonna resist all of everybody, man?

478
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Just do what everybody else is doing.

479
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You'll be fine.

480
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay?

481
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It was okay.

482
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So he just prays with everybody.

483
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He hears the qir'a of turaqah, salah is done, we'll walk it out.

484
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I was like, so, how was that?

485
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
He goes, man, I gotta tell you.

486
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I've been to therapy.

487
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I've been with my bros.

488
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I've been to bars.

489
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I have never felt that much peace in my entire life.

490
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Straight.

491
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
He's just the first impression.

492
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I've never felt this.

493
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't know what it was, but I've never felt this much peace

494
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
in my entire life.

495
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Subhanallah.

496
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
There's something so powerful about that gathering,

497
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm telling you.

498
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There's the descent of angels over these gatherings,

499
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
especially on the day of Friday.

500
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We're living the word, we're living Surat al-Jumu'a, every Jumu'a.

501
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
We're living the word of Allah, every Jumu'a.

502
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
This is,

503
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Ifa nudiya dis-salati min yawm al-Jumu'a.

504
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's on the emphasis on the act as opposed to...

505
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Now, I was curious about the word the call.

506
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The call has been made.

507
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And I found another place in the Quran where nudu is used,

508
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and they were called.

509
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
They were called,

510
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
nudu an tilku wal jannah.

511
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
They were called, that's jannah.

512
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And here in this world, we're being called to jumu'a.

513
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And in the next life, we're being called to jannah.

514
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And the same word for call is being made.

515
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
As if there's a conflation over the two.

516
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Us rushing into this,

517
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
is insha'Allah turning into us rushing into that,

518
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
built by Allah's mercy.

519
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Here's what's coming up in the next episode

520
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and this deeper look of Surat al-Jumu'a.

521
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That's a great sunnah of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.

522
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But if somebody who's Arab or speaks Arabic,

523
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
starts talking about, you know, how we should help our young men and women

524
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
become more independent and become financially responsible

525
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
so they can get married early.

526
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But he says all of that in Arabic to a Turkish community.

527
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And he says all of that in Arabic to a Bangladeshi community.

528
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Did any of them hear anything about the ayat of Allah?

529
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
They didn't.

530
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That's actually what I'm shared with you is inspired by the ayat of the Quran.

531
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The Quran talks about these issues.

532
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You know, it talks about financial independence

533
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and how you have to become related to marriage.

534
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So this is an important issue that the community needs to hear

535
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
but now they can't hear because it's only being said in Arabic.

536
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And the problem with that is, Allah never said the Arabic language is sacred.

537
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The sacred words in the Arabic language are sacred.

538
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Quran is sacred, not Arabic.

539
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
When I say,

540
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
When I say,

541
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That's not more Islamic.
