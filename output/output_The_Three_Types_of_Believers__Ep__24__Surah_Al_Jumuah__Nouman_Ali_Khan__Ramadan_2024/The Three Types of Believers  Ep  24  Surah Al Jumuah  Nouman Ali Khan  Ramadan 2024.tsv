0	6000	The power of a gathering, when people are gathered together and they're hearing ideas.
6000	12000	If they're hearing powerful ideas, if they're hearing powerful and there's no more,
12000	16000	the world does not have more powerful ideas than the Quran.
16000	19000	That's the word of God, that's the word of Allah Himself.
19000	25000	If they were hearing these ideas week after week after week after week,
25000	28000	you don't think those people become powerful?
31000	38000	So all three things now come together, the solution was given in one,
38000	42000	the problem was described in two, and the practical steps now.
42000	46000	What must you do? That's now coming in this section, this remarkable section.
46000	48000	So let's begin with ayah number nine.
48000	52000	Ya ayyuhal ladheena amanoo idhanoodiya dis-salat min yaumil jumaa
52000	57000	Those of you who believe, idhanoodiya dis-salat when the call is made for the prayer,
58000	63000	min yaumil jumaa as part of the day of Friday, min tab'idiyya.
63000	67000	So you can translate this on the day of Friday,
67000	72000	but you can also translate this as from part of the day of Friday.
72000	74000	Because we're not being asked to pray all Friday,
74000	78000	we're being asked to pray only a part of the Friday, so min tab'idiyya.
78000	82000	fas'awiladiklilahi then rush to the remembrance of Allah.
83000	86000	wazarul bay'a and leave the sale.
86000	93000	That all of you is better for you if in fact you truly know.
93000	95000	That's the ayah that we're going to discuss.
95000	98000	The first thing I want you to note here is ya ayyuhal ladheena amanoo.
98000	100000	Those of you who claim to believe.
100000	105000	This phrase you should remind, remember always when you leave this phrase in the Quran,
105000	108000	it actually includes three groups of people.
108000	111000	I started the series with this word, wrapping it up with this too.
111000	114000	Madina had three kinds of believers.
114000	117000	The strongest believers, the...
117000	120000	Okay, haven't been tested yet believers?
120000	126000	And then the hypocrites and the middle category is being pulled towards the hypocrites
126000	131000	and Allah is pulling them towards iman, but on the outside they all claim to believe.
131000	136000	So when Allah says ya ayyuhal ladheena amanoo, all of them are being addressed together.
136000	138000	All of them are being addressed together.
138000	140000	And he says,
140000	145000	When the call is made,
145000	149000	I'll stop there for a moment before we get to the prayer part.
149000	153000	The call being made is referring to the azan, right?
153000	154000	The azan.
154000	158000	The word azan is not used in the Quran in the meaning of the azan the way we use it.
158000	161000	Or did the muazzin give the azan?
161000	164000	Was the azan of Jumran salamate?
164000	166000	Or was the azan of Maghrib called?
166000	168000	We use the word azan for the prayer call.
168000	170000	The Quran doesn't use that term.
170000	173000	The Quran uses the word nida.
173000	178000	Culturally we kind of became accustomed to using the word azan.
178000	180000	And what's the difference between azan and nida?
180000	182000	So I want you to understand that.
182000	184000	Azan actually means announcement.
184000	187000	Azan means announcement.
187000	189000	Nida means a call.
189000	191000	Nida means a call.
191000	192000	Okay?
192000	194000	What's the difference between an announcement and a call?
194000	198000	If I make an announcement, I just want you to know something.
198000	202000	When I call, what am I doing?
202000	204000	I'm saying come here.
204000	206000	There's a demand.
206000	209000	An announcement just gives information.
209000	212000	But a call makes a demand.
212000	213000	A call makes a demand.
213000	220000	So now the prayer the azan that we give is actually called a call.
220000	222000	Now let's go through quickly.
222000	225000	Let's just go through just the opening of the azan.
225000	228000	Every part of the azan is actually a call.
228000	230000	Okay?
230000	232000	And you have to see the qunaya in the call.
232000	234000	Remember qunaya?
234000	236000	Saying something without saying something?
236000	239000	The first part of the azan is Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.
239000	240000	Isn't it?
240000	241000	Allah is greater.
241000	242000	Allah is greater.
242000	245000	The wrong translation is Allah is the greatest.
245000	247000	That would be Allahu Gual Akbar.
247000	249000	This is not Afdal Tafdeen.
249000	251000	There's no Lamat Tariq on it.
251000	252000	There's no Lamat Tafdeen on it.
252000	255000	This is Allahu Akbar, which means Allah is greater.
255000	258000	In that phrase, there is a call.
258000	260000	Hey, you're fixing your car right now.
260000	261000	You heard Allahu Akbar.
261000	265000	Allah is greater than the need to fix your car.
265000	267000	You're having a sandwich right now.
267000	268000	Allahu Akbar.
268000	271000	Allah is greater than your need to add more ketchup and go for another sandwich.
271000	273000	Go towards the salar.
273000	276000	You're in the middle of studying for your exam right now.
276000	277000	You heard Allahu Akbar.
277000	281000	Allah is greater than the need for your review for this exam.
281000	287000	In other words, there's a necessary comparison with anything you're doing to the call.
287000	289000	That's the first thing.
289000	290000	When you say,
290000	303000	When you testify to this, it is as if Allah is saying those who accept this message,
303000	306000	those who prove that they accept this message,
306000	311000	just like you're called to Islam, you're being called to the prayer.
311000	312000	Actually.
312000	316000	The testimony, because we're already Muslim.
316000	317000	Why do we need to hear,
317000	318000	Ashadu-Allah-Lah-Lah-Lal-Allah.
318000	319000	We're like,
319000	321000	Yeah, I am more Muslim family,
321000	323000	or somebody became Muslim two years ago was like,
323000	325000	Yeah, I did that two years ago.
325000	327000	Why are you saying it every prayer, bro?
327000	329000	Ashadu-Allah-Lah-Lal-Allah.
329000	331000	I took the Shahada in front of the machine.
331000	334000	Everybody gave me a high five minute to clear and I hug.
334000	336000	I was all hooked out for three hours.
336000	339000	Then they left me alone and nobody talks to me now.
339000	340000	Right.
340000	342000	The new Muslim story.
342000	343000	Right.
343000	345000	Why am I hearing the Shahada over and over again?
345000	351000	It's as if the claim, this testimony, you need to prove it.
351000	357000	You need to prove the ultimate proof that you accepted this faith is actually the prayer.
357000	359000	It's actually the prayer.
359000	360000	Where do we get this idea from?
360000	362000	It's actually spelled out in the Quran too.
362000	364000	In Surah Al-Qiyamah in Surah number 75 Allah says,
364000	367000	Fala Sadaqat Walaa Salla.
367000	372000	He says he didn't accept the truth and he didn't pray.
372000	375000	He didn't accept the truth and he didn't pray.
375000	376000	What does that mean?
376000	378000	Had he accepted the truth,
378000	380000	I'm going to pray it.
380000	383000	You find in Surah Al-Bakr something really interesting.
383000	385000	You remember before the Ka'bah,
385000	388000	the Muslims used to pray towards Jerusalem.
388000	389000	Right?
389000	391000	They used to pray towards Jerusalem.
391000	393000	And then Allah changed the direction.
393000	396000	When Allah changed the direction back towards the Ka'bah,
396000	400000	some of the Jewish community started making fun of the Muslims.
400000	401000	Well, what happened?
401000	403000	You had the wrong address the whole time?
403000	406000	So what happened to all those prayers you were praying in the wrong direction?
406000	408000	Those don't count, huh?
408000	411000	Allah says, Allah responds to this criticism.
411000	412000	And he says,
412000	415000	Wa Ma Kaan Allahu Wa Ma Kaan Allahu Di Uli A'i Maanakum.
415000	418000	Allah will not waste your iman.
418000	422000	But they weren't saying, Allah will not waste your iman.
422000	425000	They were saying, Allah will waste your prayer.
425000	428000	But Allah said, Allah will not waste your iman.
428000	432000	You use the word iman instead of using the word prayer.
432000	436000	Teaching us that to Allah, iman and prayer are one and the same.
436000	437000	When you hear,
437000	439000	Ashadu Alla Ila Allaha Illa Allah,
439000	441000	Ashadu Alla Muhammad Ar-Rasulullah,
441000	443000	that is iman, isn't it?
443000	447000	And iman should translate immediately to me as what?
448000	449000	Prayer.
449000	451000	Should translate as prayer.
451000	453000	Hayya' ala s-salaa,
453000	455000	I mean you can't get, that's not even Ken'ayah.
455000	456000	Come pray now.
456000	458000	You get it?
458000	460000	Let's go.
460000	463000	But Hayya' ala al-Falah is really cool.
463000	465000	Hayya' ala al-Falah.
465000	467000	Come to success.
467000	470000	We're going to see the word success here too, soon.
470000	472000	It's a really interesting word, Falah.
472000	475000	Falah and Arabic is to break something.
475000	478000	So break the earth, break a rock.
478000	482000	And the farmer breaks the soil
482000	484000	and plants the seed.
484000	487000	And when the farmer finally breaks it again,
487000	490000	is when he's plucking his crop, when it's already,
490000	492000	and he's breaking the soil and he's taking out,
492000	494000	it's called the harvest season,
494000	496000	at that time he's called the muflih.
496000	498000	That's when he's called the muflih.
498000	501000	And that season is Falah season.
501000	503000	Falah season.
503000	506000	And like, for example, in Palestine,
506000	509000	there are certain people, they're known as the farmers,
509000	513000	and that's actually even a tribal region, al-Falahin.
513000	515000	Right, al-Falah, in Palestine, al-Falahin,
515000	517000	like they're farmers.
517000	519000	And they have that farming tradition.
519000	523000	Now the idea of al-Falah is come towards something
523000	526000	that will lead you to harvest season.
526000	529000	You're planting, every sula, you're planting a seed,
529000	532000	and you're going to pull that seed out on judgment day.
532000	534000	And every sula you're planting a seed,
534000	536000	and you're going to lead to some kind of success
536000	538000	in this life and in the next.
538000	541000	Inna sula tataanhaa al-fahshaa'i wal-munkah.
541000	544000	Allah is actually calling you towards success.
544000	546000	Which is pretty amazing.
546000	549000	The adhan saying, come be successful.
549000	551000	Come be successful.
551000	554000	People ask, like, I go to university,
554000	556000	it's really hard to pray, can I not pray?
556000	558000	Can I just pray later?
558000	562000	Like, at the end of the semester, make the whole semester up during the summer.
562000	567000	And then you wonder why you didn't pass any of your tests.
567000	570000	Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.
570000	573000	Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you
573000	576000	that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com
576000	579000	and help other sign up, even sponsor students for bayinatv.com
579000	582000	so we can create worldwide communities of students
582000	585000	that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran
585000	588000	and are insha'Allah ta'ala spreading that in their own circles.
588000	590000	Thanks so much.
590000	591000	Allah says, come succeed.
591000	593000	You're like, no, I want to fail.
593000	597000	Ha, ya'al fadaah.
597000	599000	Then He says, qad qamat as-sadaah.
599000	602000	The prayer is already in the Qama even.
602000	603000	Qad qamat as-sadaah.
603000	604000	The prayer is stood.
604000	606000	Come on, get up.
606000	608000	And even standing is really remarkable
608000	612000	because standing should remind us of ya'ul mul standing.
613000	615000	Right?
615000	618000	So the entire adhan is actually a call.
618000	621000	I wanted to just give you an appreciation of this word,
621000	623000	how that's different from an announcement.
623000	627000	Of course, we see it as an announcement now, as an announcement for prayer,
627000	629000	but actually we should see it as a call for prayer.
629000	632000	So ya'ayu al-adheena amanu idha nudiya.
632000	635000	Let's go to the second word now.
635000	638000	Actually, before it goes to the second word, nudiya is a passive verb.
638000	641000	Passive verbs mean you don't know who did it.
641000	645000	So it's not when the caller calls, nadaa munad in this sadaa.
645000	650000	It's actually nudiya when the call is made.
650000	652000	When the call is made.
652000	653000	You know what that means?
653000	656000	That means it's irrelevant who made the call.
656000	659000	If it's bilal who gave the adhan, go.
659000	661000	If it's Allah that gave the adhan, go.
661000	663000	If it's Abu Bakr gave the adhan, go.
663000	666000	If it's Abu Dahl Ghafari who gave the adhan, go.
666000	669000	If it's a new Muslim, you just became Muslim two days ago
669000	671000	and gave the adhan, go.
671000	676000	If you're in a, you know, Baghledesi neighborhood
676000	681000	and you're not Baghledesi and you heard the adhan from a Baghledesi, go.
681000	683000	Does it matter where the adhan came from?
683000	684000	No.
684000	687000	The only thing that matters is your call to the prayer.
687000	688000	You know what that does?
688000	691000	The people that are going to lead the prayer,
691000	695000	the people that are going to be the congregation,
695000	698000	where they're from, who they are, none of that matters now.
698000	701000	All that matters is the call was made.
701000	704000	Now some people could say, I'm going to go attend a Juma.
704000	709000	Like I went to, when I was in Rome, it was Juma one of the days I was there, it was Juma.
709000	711000	So I had to find a masjid to go pray Juma.
711000	713000	And the khudbah was in Arabic, which was really cool.
713000	716000	And the rest of the khudbah was in Italian.
716000	718000	That was so cool.
718000	722000	Also, I felt like I was watching something on Netflix or something.
722000	725000	It was pretty epic.
725000	728000	But I didn't understand, I mean I just, Alhamdulillah, the Arabic part I understood.
728000	731000	But like the Italian part, I didn't understand a word.
731000	735000	But people are like, yeah, and I was like,
736000	738000	but it doesn't matter.
738000	743000	There's many times, when I was in Malaysia, I'll go attend a Juma in a masjid
743000	745000	where the khudbah is going on in Bahasa Malaya.
745000	748000	I don't understand the language, but I'm sitting and listening.
748000	751000	There were times in New York, I'm late for Salah or I need to go to a masjid,
751000	752000	but that masjid is too far.
752000	755000	And it was actually on 2nd and 11th Avenue, there was a Bangla Dish masjid.
755000	757000	And they gave the khudbah since the 1920s, I think.
757000	760000	They're giving khudbah in Bangla. They still give khudbah in Bangla.
760000	763000	It's like, oh, I sit there, Kim and I sit there, and I just sit there, and I listen to the khudbah.
763000	765000	No problem. Why?
765000	768000	Because it doesn't matter where the call is coming from.
768000	771000	You're going to go because there's Juma. That's it.
771000	773000	This is an incredible thing that Allah did.
773000	779000	Because what happened in many different religions
779000	783000	is that the religion actually became very ethnic.
783000	787000	Like even in America, there's a black church, there's a Spanish church,
787000	792000	there's a Guatemalaj, there's a Cuban church, there's this church, there's that church.
792000	796000	For the Muslims, you could have, okay, there's an Albanian community here.
796000	800000	But this is not an Albanian masjid, this is just a masjid.
800000	804000	There's no restriction on anybody coming,
804000	808000	and you shouldn't be feeling like you're out of place, you're in Allah's house.
808000	811000	That's it. Allah's house feels like Allah's house.
811000	816000	And this is a remarkable thing that Allah captured in the word Nudia.
816000	820000	This is one of the most powerful features of Islam.
820000	825000	I met a young man when I was 20 at the time.
825000	828000	This is a long time ago. The year was 1875.
828000	831000	And this was in Brooklyn.
831000	836000	I go to pray Juma at the masjid in Bedford, Brooklyn.
836000	841000	I go to Imam's Salaaj's masjid, I go there maybe an hour before the Juma.
841000	844000	Just sit there and recite some Quran.
844000	847000	I'm going to be there and I see this guy sitting there.
847000	850000	He's just just by himself.
850000	853000	I'm going to make some friends with this guy. I go to start talking to him.
853000	855000	And he says, yeah, it's my first time.
855000	858000	I was like, really? What were you doing before?
858000	861000	And he said, well, I was studying.
861000	866000	First, I was born in a Christian family, but I decided to start studying the Bible.
866000	871000	And then when I started studying the Bible, I felt like we're not following the Bible in the church.
871000	876000	And so I decided that I'm going to take the Bible more seriously.
876000	880000	Then I looked up who actually studies the Bible in its original language.
880000	882000	And I found out it's the Jewish community.
882000	887000	And New York has a lot of synagogues and, you know, temples and things like that, Jewish temples and stuff.
887000	892000	So I joined a synagogue and I learned Hebrew for over two years.
892000	896000	And I studied the Bible and he started doing this when he was 16 years old.
896000	898000	He was now 18, 19 years old.
898000	899000	Right?
899000	904000	And he just started studying the Bible and he goes and I've been in the Jewish community a long time,
904000	909000	but they made it clear to let me know that I'm not truly Jewish because I'm converting.
909000	912000	Because I'm not from the children of Israel.
912000	915000	And they made sure that I understand that different.
915000	916000	I understood that I'm a Gentile.
916000	917000	I got that.
917000	918000	It's in the Bible.
918000	919000	That's how it is.
919000	926000	And then one day I just kind of passed by this place and they were praying and I just decided to just,
926000	929000	I didn't know what it was, but I thought it looked a little bit like the Jewish prayer
929000	931000	because the Jews also have Qiyam and Rukour.
931000	933000	They have some of these things.
933000	936000	So he joined the prayer and the musted.
936000	937000	And he didn't even know what he's doing.
937000	939000	He just joined it.
939000	941000	And then he looked around and he saw black people.
941000	942000	He saw Arabs.
942000	943000	He saw brown people.
943000	944000	He saw white people.
944000	949000	He saw every color you can find in one row.
949000	953000	And they're all saying, said, I'm to each other and they're all hanging out together.
953000	954000	They're eating together.
954000	962000	And he's just like, I don't, I don't, I mean, I've seen this kind of diversity at a train station.
962000	964000	Oh, why is there this much?
964000	967000	What kind of church is the church?
967000	970000	At least you got to have some, at least some similar color.
971000	974000	These people are from different cultures and different languages.
974000	981000	The thing that brought him to Islam was how it was actually just the call is made.
981000	982000	Everybody showed it.
982000	985000	Wa a'a sareena minhum lamma yalhaqubiya.
985000	989000	And that itself is a demonstration of the power, the might of Islam.
989000	995000	Allah being Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem, it shows inside, like in every house of Allah.
995000	999000	And as the more the world globalizes, right?
999000	1003000	The more diversity you see in every house of Allah, it's such an incredible thing.
1003000	1005000	I don't think we realize how powerful that is.
1005000	1007000	We don't even realize what we're sitting on.
1007000	1010000	It's so, so powerful.
1010000	1016000	This thing is so powerful that actually the Jum'ah became dangerous.
1017000	1026000	The Jum'ah became dangerous because if the Imams can teach the people to connect with the Quran
1026000	1029000	and see the world around them through the word of Allah,
1029000	1034000	they might start pointing out things that are wrong in society and not accept them.
1034000	1038000	Or start challenging some things in society that are wrong.
1038000	1041000	So what happened, for example, when the British took over India,
1042000	1046000	they wanted to control, the first thing they did is they wanted to control
1046000	1052000	and change the system of education so the Indian Muslims will no longer study Arabic.
1052000	1056000	And they replaced Arabic with English education.
1056000	1061000	And over a couple of generations, for example, what they did with the Muslims in Algeria
1061000	1065000	and Morocco and Tunisia, other places, what the French did is,
1065000	1071000	now Algerian youth know more French than they know Arabic.
1071000	1074000	So you don't have to attack the Quran.
1074000	1076000	You don't have to do that.
1076000	1080000	You just have to make sure that when Yatlu alayhim, ayaatihi is happening,
1080000	1083000	they're just sounds.
1083000	1086000	They just become Himmari, yahmelu asfara.
1086000	1089000	So they don't process anything.
1089000	1093000	And that way, you can have Jum'ah without having Jum'ah.
1093000	1094000	You understand?
1094000	1098000	So what if thousands of them are gathered together and they hear something,
1098000	1100000	they can't make any sense of it?
1100000	1103000	And then in other places, what happened is, then the instructions were given,
1103000	1106000	we will tell you what to say.
1106000	1109000	We're going to tell you what to say in the Friday sermon.
1109000	1113000	You're going to talk about how you have to wear leather socks,
1113000	1117000	or how long your beard is supposed to be, or how high your pants are supposed to be,
1117000	1122000	or the benefits of the day of Friday,
1122000	1125000	or some story of this or a story of that.
1125000	1127000	Don't talk about the Quran.
1127000	1129000	If we find out you're talking about this surah,
1129000	1134000	if we find out you're talking about that ayaat, it's not going to be good for you.
1134000	1138000	So the sermon got controlled.
1138000	1143000	The sermon that was supposed to unfiltered connect people directly with the word of Allah
1143000	1145000	was now, it was too powerful.
1145000	1147000	The Khubbah is too powerful.
1147000	1151000	It's too, you know, people are coming and it has this divine power
1151000	1153000	that you don't have to make an announcement.
1153000	1155000	You know, when I'm coming here for this program,
1155000	1157000	I have to announce it on social media.
1157000	1159000	I have to let you guys know.
1159000	1163000	And we have to make sure that other people find out and there has to be some,
1163000	1167000	the local community has to send emails and maybe send WhatsApp messages
1167000	1169000	or blackmail your neighbor or something.
1169000	1170000	I don't know.
1170000	1173000	But does anybody need an announcement to come to Juma?
1173000	1176000	Is there a weekly please come to Friday prayer?
1176000	1177000	No.
1177000	1182000	And the people who are knowledgeable come, the people who are not knowledgeable come,
1182000	1184000	the people who understand the language come,
1184000	1186000	the people who don't understand the language come,
1186000	1189000	the taxi driver comes, the taxi customer comes,
1189000	1192000	the restaurant owner comes, the restaurant customer comes,
1192000	1195000	the boss comes, the employee comes, everybody shows up.
1195000	1197000	On their end, no announcement.
1197000	1199000	Every week.
1199000	1202000	Every, and you know, the power of a gathering.
1202000	1206000	When people are gathered together and they're hearing ideas,
1206000	1210000	if they're hearing powerful ideas, if they're hearing powerful,
1210000	1216000	and there's no more, the world does not have more powerful ideas than the Quran.
1216000	1217000	That's the word of God.
1217000	1219000	That's the word of Allah Himself.
1219000	1225000	If they were hearing these ideas week after week after week after week,
1225000	1228000	you don't think those people become powerful?
1228000	1231000	You don't think those people become independent thinkers?
1231000	1232000	They become analytical?
1232000	1237000	They develop the mindset of Ibrahim A.S. who questions everything around him?
1237000	1239000	They don't develop that?
1239000	1241000	There's something so powerful about,
1241000	1247000	إذا نودي لصلاة من يوم الجوعة as a part of the day of Friday.
1247000	1249000	This is not just this, this, I could be discussing with you,
1249000	1251000	there are a hadith, you can look them up yourself.
1251000	1253000	I was going to make that part of this lecture today.
1253000	1257000	There are a hadith about the rewards of coming early on the day of Friday.
1257000	1258000	You know them.
1258000	1260000	Why is the day of Friday so blessed?
1260000	1261000	You know that stuff.
1261000	1263000	You've heard that stuff a bajillion times.
1263000	1266000	So I don't have to teach you that stuff because you already know it,
1266000	1267000	and you can easily look it up.
1267000	1271000	I want to talk to you about the dimension of Jumu'ah that's been forgotten.
1271000	1275000	The immense power of the Jumu'ah of the Baa.
1275000	1282000	It is a weekly convention of the Muslim community, and it's open.
1283000	1287000	نوديا also means that it allotted not your being called,
1287000	1292000	but since the call is open, even a non-Muslim walking by can sit in and listen in.
1292000	1298000	I'll tell you, I wish I could tell you this is made up, it's not made up.
1298000	1303000	I was in the West Indies, okay, in Jamaica actually, in Jamaica.
1303000	1305000	It was an Islamic convention in Jamaica.
1305000	1309000	And I met the grand mufti of the Jamaican Muslim community.
1310000	1315000	And he's an Indian fellow, and he, crazy story,
1315000	1320000	he was born in a Hindu family in Jamaica,
1320000	1323000	and his family wanted him to learn Hinduism.
1323000	1325000	So they sent him to the capital of Hinduism.
1325000	1327000	Where did they send him?
1327000	1328000	They sent him to India.
1328000	1333000	They sent him to India, and he had this address to go to, to go study,
1333000	1338000	and the door down from the Hindus was the Muslims,
1338000	1340000	and he went to the wrong door.
1340000	1343000	And there was, he did.
1343000	1348000	He got the wrong directions, and he went inside the wrong door,
1348000	1353000	and there was Juma going on, he sat in, and he came back a mufti,
1353000	1358000	and he's the mufti of West Indies Muslim community.
1359000	1363000	Because the Juma is what?
1363000	1365000	Is it an open invitation?
1365000	1368000	Is it remarkable what Juma does?
1368000	1370000	It's incredible what it does.
1370000	1372000	Anybody can sit in.
1372000	1374000	I had a friend, I won't name him because he'll get embarrassed.
1374000	1375000	He's non-Muslim.
1375000	1378000	I was travelling with him one time, and we were in a Muslim country,
1378000	1381000	and I was about to go to Friday prayer, and he said,
1381000	1382000	can I come?
1382000	1383000	I was like, yeah, you can come.
1383000	1384000	Come on.
1384000	1386000	So he comes with me, he goes, is everybody gonna notice?
1386000	1391000	I was like, you're wearing, I'm wearing a t-shirt.
1391000	1395000	I was like, oh no.
1395000	1398000	It's summer in the Arab world.
1398000	1400000	Everybody wearing a t-shirt, bro.
1400000	1403000	He's like, they all look normal.
1403000	1405000	I was like, prayer's starting.
1405000	1406000	Just, what do I gotta do?
1406000	1408000	Just sit here like everybody else.
1408000	1409000	So he sits like everybody else.
1409000	1410000	We're just sitting quiet.
1410000	1412000	There's a bus going on in Arabic.
1412000	1413000	He doesn't understand anything that's going on,
1413000	1415000	but he's sitting there, and he just notices people come in,
1415000	1416000	and they sit down.
1416000	1418000	Nobody looks at anybody else.
1418000	1420000	The people just respectfully sit down and listen,
1420000	1423000	and then they all get up to pray, and then he joins the prayer.
1423000	1425000	And he's like, well, how am I gonna pray?
1425000	1426000	How am I gonna resist all of everybody, man?
1426000	1428000	Just do what everybody else is doing.
1428000	1429000	You'll be fine.
1429000	1430000	Okay?
1430000	1431000	It was okay.
1431000	1433000	So he just prays with everybody.
1433000	1436000	He hears the qir'a of turaqah, salah is done, we'll walk it out.
1436000	1438000	I was like, so, how was that?
1438000	1441000	He goes, man, I gotta tell you.
1441000	1443000	I've been to therapy.
1443000	1445000	I've been with my bros.
1445000	1446000	I've been to bars.
1446000	1450000	I have never felt that much peace in my entire life.
1450000	1451000	Straight.
1451000	1453000	He's just the first impression.
1453000	1454000	I've never felt this.
1454000	1457000	I don't know what it was, but I've never felt this much peace
1457000	1458000	in my entire life.
1458000	1460000	Subhanallah.
1460000	1462000	There's something so powerful about that gathering,
1462000	1464000	I'm telling you.
1464000	1467000	There's the descent of angels over these gatherings,
1467000	1469000	especially on the day of Friday.
1469000	1473000	We're living the word, we're living Surat al-Jumu'a, every Jumu'a.
1473000	1476000	We're living the word of Allah, every Jumu'a.
1476000	1477000	This is,
1477000	1480000	Ifa nudiya dis-salati min yawm al-Jumu'a.
1480000	1483000	It's on the emphasis on the act as opposed to...
1483000	1486000	Now, I was curious about the word the call.
1486000	1488000	The call has been made.
1488000	1491000	And I found another place in the Quran where nudu is used,
1491000	1493000	and they were called.
1493000	1494000	They were called,
1494000	1496000	nudu an tilku wal jannah.
1496000	1499000	They were called, that's jannah.
1499000	1502000	And here in this world, we're being called to jumu'a.
1502000	1505000	And in the next life, we're being called to jannah.
1505000	1507000	And the same word for call is being made.
1507000	1510000	As if there's a conflation over the two.
1510000	1512000	Us rushing into this,
1512000	1514000	is insha'Allah turning into us rushing into that,
1514000	1516000	built by Allah's mercy.
1517000	1519000	Here's what's coming up in the next episode
1519000	1522000	and this deeper look of Surat al-Jumu'a.
1522000	1525000	That's a great sunnah of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.
1525000	1528000	But if somebody who's Arab or speaks Arabic,
1528000	1533000	starts talking about, you know, how we should help our young men and women
1533000	1537000	become more independent and become financially responsible
1537000	1540000	so they can get married early.
1540000	1544000	But he says all of that in Arabic to a Turkish community.
1544000	1547000	And he says all of that in Arabic to a Bangladeshi community.
1547000	1550000	Did any of them hear anything about the ayat of Allah?
1550000	1551000	They didn't.
1551000	1555000	That's actually what I'm shared with you is inspired by the ayat of the Quran.
1555000	1557000	The Quran talks about these issues.
1557000	1560000	You know, it talks about financial independence
1560000	1563000	and how you have to become related to marriage.
1563000	1566000	So this is an important issue that the community needs to hear
1566000	1569000	but now they can't hear because it's only being said in Arabic.
1569000	1575000	And the problem with that is, Allah never said the Arabic language is sacred.
1575000	1579000	The sacred words in the Arabic language are sacred.
1579000	1582000	Quran is sacred, not Arabic.
1582000	1583000	When I say,
1583000	1584000	When I say,
1584000	1586000	That's not more Islamic.
