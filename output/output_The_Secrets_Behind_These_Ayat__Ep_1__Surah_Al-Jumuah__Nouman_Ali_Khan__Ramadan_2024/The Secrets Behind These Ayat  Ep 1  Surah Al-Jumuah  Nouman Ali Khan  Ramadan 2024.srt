1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're just just imagine for a moment every time you enter a surah, you're entering into one of Allah's palaces.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This surah from Allah is a gift sent from above the seven heavens to humanity

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and you're entering something that the world did not have access to it.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This came from way way above and it came as a gift to humanity.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll take a deep look at Surat Al-Jumu'ah as deep as I can do at least

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and there's still endless oceans left after whatever I'm able to do.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But whatever I try to do, I will try to simplify as much as possible.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's how humanity was sent down. There's a mindset that's taught in the Zayat.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You know the Quran is not just information, it's a mindset. What is priority?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So what Allah says, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
declares the perfection of Allah. Is there a special stress on the earth?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You understand. So you'll find in most of these surahs wherever Tasbih has mentioned

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
there's a special stress on the earth.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And what's really cool is Allah will mention that special stress on the earth

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and immediately in the next ayah

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Surat Al-Jumu'ah

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Peace be upon you.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Alhamdulillah, Lord of the worlds.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Peace be upon the Sadaqah, the messengers, his family and companions.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We've been waiting for him to come to Yuma-ddin.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Allah has made us from them, from those who believe and do righteous deeds

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and are in the right path and are patient and secure, Lord of the worlds.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'd like to first express to you how excited I am and how happy I am to see so many of you

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and I know that many of you have driven long distances to come and attend this program.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Insha'Allah Ta'ala, I pray to Allah that he counts all of this as ibadah for him

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and that he includes us among that hadith that was mentioned by the Imam.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Khayru kumman ta'alam al-Qur'anah wa'alamahu.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The best of you are the ones who learn the Quran and then teach it.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So what I'm going to start with is an introduction just so you all have an idea

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
how these lectures are going to go, how these discussions are going to go

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and what the plan is for them.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
For this entire week, if those of you that are committed to coming the entire week with me,

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
we're going to be studying Surah al-Jumu'at.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So we're going to be just doing one Surah of the Quran and it's only 11 ayat.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not long at all.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So it's only 11 ayat, but it's going to take us a whole week to study that Surah.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Somebody asked me on the way here, actually a volunteer asked me on the way here,

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
are you going to be like very high level or are you going to talk to the rest of us?

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I need to address that question.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
My job is to try to study the Quran as deeply as I can

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and address some of the hardest questions I can address.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In my own investigation with my team, with other researchers and scholars.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And then that's the easy part of my job.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The hard part of my job is to learn all of whatever I can learn

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and then to simplify it so that human beings can understand it.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because scholars and students, they speak some kind of alien language

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
that the rest of us don't understand.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So I need to make sure that I explain things to you in a way

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
that makes sense to you, that you can grasp.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Some concepts are difficult, they're more complicated,

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but I'm going to do my best to keep things as simple as possible.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So there's two different things.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
One, you want to talk about complicated things,

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but two, you want to talk about them in simple language.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And you have to have that balance.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because sometimes people just talk about simple things,

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that's not healthy because life is complicated.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There are some complicated things we need to talk about.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then what happens is when people know,

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
people have more knowledge than they start using more complicated language

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to talk about that, you know, university professor language,

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and then nobody understands.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then those discussions remain in certain circles in the society

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and everybody else doesn't get it.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And this is actually the problem that I felt myself

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and I feel that pain for you.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So what I try to do in Sha'Allah and these lectures is yes,

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
we will take a deep look at Surat al-Jumu'ah,

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
as deep as I can do at least.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And there's still endless oceans left after whatever I'm able to do.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But whatever I try to do, I will try to simplify as much as possible.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, having said that, I'm going to speak to you for about 40 minutes,

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
45 minutes at a time.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The moment I see some of you traveling into the spiritual world,

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
some of you do this in very creative ways.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Some of you look like you're just really concentrating on the material,

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
like, you know, other people fight it.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They fight it by agreeing with me a lot.

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Like even if I'm not saying anything, they're like,

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
like slowly declining.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I've seen the brothers do this a lot,

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
like they'll be sitting in the masjid floor,

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
they're sitting, for instance, sitting like this,

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and they're sitting like this, and they're sitting like this.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And eventually, you know.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, but 40 minutes at a time, then I'm going to give you guys a break.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I know there's lots of sisters, lots of brothers here.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So what I'm going to try to do in those breaks,

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the breaks will be five to seven minutes long.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I believe Maghrib is around 9.20, so we have about two hours before Maghrib.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Tomorrow onwards, I'll start exactly at seven o'clock,

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
because I want to make the most of the time we have.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So seven, maybe five to 10 minute break in those breaks,

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
you can come up to me or I can go in that middle area so I can hear from brothers and sisters.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We can have some conversations, take whatever questions.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The breaks are dedicated for questions and discussions and comments.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Those are the most valuable pictures can wait.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm here a whole week.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We'll figure out a system and we'll do all the pictures you need to do.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No problem. I have no problem with it.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But in the breaks, I'd rather just focus on conversations.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is what I'm going to do, but now let me tell you what I expect from you.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This week, I want you to use your imagination.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you walked into a historical palace, an ancient palace,

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
when you walk in, people walk in with their cameras,

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and they're making video of every door and every decoration

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and the ceiling and the windows and all that stuff, right?

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Or the artwork on the wall or the calligraphy and things like that, right?

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Tourists are just, wow, this is amazing, that kind of thing, right?

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Because this represents the work of a great king of the past.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Just imagine for a moment, every time you enter a sura,

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you're entering into one of Allah's palaces.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This sura from Allah is a gift sent from above the seven heavens to humanity.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're entering something that the world did not have access to it.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This came from way, way above.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And it came as a gift to humanity.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Tanzilum merrabil alameen.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What happens in the Quran, if you've even read the Quran in translation,

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you will know the Quran has a lot of repetition, right?

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The Quran talks about judgment day, and then it talks again about judgment day,

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and again about judgment day.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The Quran talks about one prophet, like Musa'a alayhi s-salam,

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and it'll talk about him again and again and again and again, right?

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So there are many subjects in the Quran that keep repeating.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And what happens to you and me is when we look at that and we say,

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
oh, I already know that part.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, I already read that before.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've seen that before.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Show me something new.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Where's the cool stuff?

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Where's the new stuff?

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Because we're always into something new, right?

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And now because of TikTok and Instagram and all this other stuff and YouTube reels,

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
now we're addicted to something new.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Like you can't, if you're watching one clip, one clip,

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
then you see an older clip.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I've already seen this.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You get annoyed if you see something you've already seen.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So we become addicted to newer forms of entertainment.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But the way I want you to think about this,

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the way I describe this to my students is every surah is like a palace designed by Allah.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And there's another palace designed by Allah and they may have similar bricks,

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
or they may have similar windows.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But does that make them the same palace?

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Are the doors being used exactly in the same way?

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Is the flow exactly the same?

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Is the exterior and the interior exactly the same?

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No, every bit of art has its own unique identity, doesn't it?

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Think of an easier example nowadays.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Forget about architecture.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Think about cars, right?

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There's one manufacturer, clearly a couple of big manufacturers in this town, right?

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And they have lots of different models.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And those models have a lot in common, don't they?

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But each model has its own unique identity too, doesn't it?

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It has its own features.

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Unique exterior, interior, the mechanics, the technology.

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There's some variation all the time.

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What I want you to think about when you study the Quran is you're not trying to study the entire Quran.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Just give yourself to one surah.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Really give yourself to one surah.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And this surah is super short.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's like not even two pages.

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's really, really short.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So what I want you to do this week is just the whole week,

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
read this surah over and over again.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Just before this lecture, after this lecture, just read the surah and ask yourself,

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
what is Allah saying here?

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What does He want from me here?

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What does this mean?

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ask whatever questions come to your mind.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Start documenting your questions about this surah.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The questions I want to discuss with you in this week,

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'll take some of your other questions too.

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I don't want to hear your, like, don't worry about the questions about nail polish or halal meat from McDonald's

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
or just, you know, those questions will be there before this program

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and those questions will be there after this program.

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But you know what?

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's surrender our questions to the Quran for a week.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm calling it Quran week because I want this to be a week of just Quran for you.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You just immerse yourself completely into it.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Now, we're going to start talking about surah al-Jum'ah because we are short on time.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
These slides are not there to make your life easy at all.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They are there to make my life easy.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, so this is you getting, you know how when you use an app, it's easy to follow,

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
but you don't see the programming code behind it.

188
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm showing you some of the code, not all of the code, some of the code,

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
but that's for me to navigate so you get some idea.

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If you, even if you take these pictures, you're not going to use them in your, like,

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you're never going to look at them again.

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But that's okay.

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I'm still going to walk.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This helps me organize my thoughts and everything I want to share with you.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Some of these things you can take a picture of, you might benefit from,

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
but most of the time it is complicated.

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So don't trust the slides.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You know those professors that put a slide on the screen and everybody's focused on the slide

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and nobody's listening to the professor?

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's what I don't want happening.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is for me as my aid.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What will help you is my explanation.

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's what's going to help you.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So don't turn this into a distraction for yourself.

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Regardless, in my study of the Quran, I've come to believe that the surahs of the Quran are in groups.

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
They are in groups.

207
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So, you know, there's 114 surahs in the Quran, right?

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And you'll see, for example, Surat al-Baqarah.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What's after Surat al-Baqarah, people?

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ali-Imran, what's after Ali-Imran?

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Nisa and what's after Nisa?

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Ma'ida.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So, Baqarah, Ali-Imran, Nisa and Ma'ida are four very large surahs.

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
All four of them were given to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, when he was in Medina.

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So, they're very large and they're all from Medina and they're all together.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So, those four surahs are a what?

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
They're a group.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And when you study them carefully, you will see there's very deep connections between the four surahs.

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They are together for a reason.

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
When you go further in the Quran, you look at Surat al-Alam and Surat al-A'raf, two very large Makkan surahs.

221
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So, there were four Maddini surahs and then two what?

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Makkan. Makkan surah means the Prophet got them when he was in Makkah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, right?

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Those two surahs are very, very large.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Makkan surahs are usually not that large.

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There are some relatively, but these are the largest ones.

226
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And these two are together and they're very closely related to each other.

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They become a group, just a group of two.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And then you see two very large Maddini surahs again.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Anfaal and Tawbah.

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And they're also deeply connected to each other.

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So, what that does is you're studying a surah, but you also have to figure out what neighborhood does it belong to?

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Which group does it belong to?

233
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Which other surah complements it?

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And what group of surahs came before?

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And how is the conversation proceeding?

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
In every book, many of you are university students or university graduated.

237
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
In any book, in any subject, there is a logic to the sequence.

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If you can't understand what the logic is to the sequence, you can't understand the book.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You can't make sense of it.

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But a lot of times in our study of the Quran, we think that this order of the Quran is just something that the Muslims decided to agree on.

241
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But this is actually not the real order of the Quran as intended by Allah.

242
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I strongly disagree with that philosophy.

243
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I believe Allah Himself said,

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
A book in which its ayat were stitched together.

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Stitch together when you stitch something.

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Every stitch is perfectly placed or no.

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Every stitch is exactly where it's supposed to be.

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And the word, the fact that even Allah called it Kitab.

249
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Kitab doesn't mean speech.

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Kitab means what?

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Book and book is not a Word document.

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A book is not a Google Doc.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
A book back in the day is something that was carved or scratched.

254
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
When you carve something or write something or scratch something, can you change the order anymore?

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No, so if Allah is calling the entire Quran a Kitab, this actually among many other evidences,

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
the book was intended to be in this order from Allah.

257
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
From Allah.

258
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Just like when you say,

259
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, Malik Yom Iddin, there's an order, right?

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And you cannot change that order.

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You cannot say,

262
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim first, Alhamdulillah, Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, second.

263
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You can't do that.

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's a set order.

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The same way there's an order within the ayat of the Quran,

266
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
there's an order to the entire Quran.

267
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And when you observe that order, you learn a lot.

268
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So we're going to go into every ayah of the Surah,

269
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
but first I want you to know what neighborhood does it belong to, right?

270
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And this is right next to another group of Surahs.

271
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So I'm going to start there.

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This is Surah number, by the way.

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Anybody know the Surah number?

274
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Very good.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
62.

276
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The group before this one is 50 to 56.

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Qaf Tawakya.

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's the previous group.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And that group is all Makki Surahs.

280
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
When I say Makki Surahs, what do I mean?

281
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Surahs given to the Prophet, S.A.W. in Makkah, right?

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
In the early period, the first 13 years.

283
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Those Surahs have a lot of commonalities.

284
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I've already covered a series of those Surahs.

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And in those Surahs, one of the things you learn is Allah is constantly warning those who don't believe.

286
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He's warning people who don't believe in the afterlife.

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He's warning people who don't believe in the Quran.

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He's giving them warning.

289
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So the people in Makkah who don't believe are the target audience,

290
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and particularly the wealthiest among them.

291
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So actually, it's also a mistake to think,

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh, the Quran was attacking everybody in Makkah.

293
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I was criticizing all these Makkah Mushriqin.

294
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It wasn't like that.

295
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Actually, the Quran, when it attacked, or when it was aggressive,

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it was aggressive with the elite of Makkah,

297
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the elite politicians, the multi-millionaires, etc.,

298
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
who were using their money and their influence to attack Islam.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Those were the ones it was coming after.

300
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They're called Al-Mutrafeen.

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They're called Mata'ana bihi az-wajam.

302
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And different phrases are used in the Quran to describe that group of people,

303
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and Allah goes after them directly.

304
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And you will study.

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If you study Quran carefully, especially Makkah in the Quran,

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
you will find Allah keeps highlighting,

307
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Have you seen the one who has this much money and he doesn't give?

308
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Have you seen the one who wastes his money like this?

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Have you seen the one who, you know,

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
spends to make sure that people don't listen to the Quran, etc.?

311
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
They say this, they say this.

312
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's not everybody who's saying this.

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
There's a group of people that have a lot of power and a lot of money,

314
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and they're using that power and influence and money

315
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to attack the mission of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

316
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and the Quran is responding to them.

317
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The huge population of Makkah, many of them,

318
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
they're just quietly watching what's happening.

319
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They're not on this side or that side, they're just spectators, you understand?

320
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And that's actually what happened when Islam won.

321
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Then many of them came to the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

322
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and said, What is this?

323
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Like, is this a new?

324
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I see that you guys broke all the idols.

325
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What's going on?

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Is there a party?

327
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And then the Quran said,

328
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If one of the Mushrikiin comes to you,

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
one of the idol worshipers comes to you,

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and says they want your protection, give them your protection

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
until they hear the speech of Allah, because they didn't know.

332
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Some of them didn't even know.

333
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We read the 23 years of the Seerah of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
from Revelation, and we think everybody knew what was happening.

335
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
No, some people were at home playing on their PlayStation,

336
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
they had no idea what's happening outside.

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And they finally got out to do the groceries, and they're like, What is this?

338
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The world had changed.

339
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So Allah says,

340
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's because these people had no idea.

341
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Give them their space.

342
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The same way that the Quran criticizes these Mushrikiin,

343
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
this group, 62, Surat Al-Jum'ah,

344
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
starts with Surah number 57, Surat Al-Hadeed,

345
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and it ends with Surah number 66.

346
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So 57 to 66, these are 10 Suras,

347
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and they're all Madani, what does that mean?

348
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Given to him in Madina, these are short Madani Suras,

349
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
one after the other, starting from 57, all the way to 66.

350
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And one of the things you will notice inside these Suras,

351
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
is that it is warning not the disbelievers,

352
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
it's actually warning the believers.

353
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's warning the believers.

354
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And I want you to understand why that happens.

355
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
When the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, started his mission in Makkah,

356
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
everybody believed.

357
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Everybody, actually everybody who believed in him,

358
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
was completely sincere, is what I meant to say.

359
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Everybody who believed in him was losing their family,

360
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
they were losing money, they were getting beat up,

361
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
only for believing in him.

362
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You get nothing from believing in the Prophet.

363
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You get nothing from it.

364
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You get beat up, you get insulted, you get attacked,

365
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
you get kicked out of your home.

366
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's what you get.

367
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If you're in Makkah and you believe in the Prophet,

368
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
because everybody, the elites, they call the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, insane.

369
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So if you join him, you are also what?

370
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're also insane.

371
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And they say that he's not loyal to his people.

372
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And so now you're not loyal to your people.

373
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So basically in the tribe, in tribal life,

374
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
if you're not loyal to your people, you lose your citizenship.

375
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's your citizenship.

376
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So if you join the Prophet, in a sense, you've lost your citizenship.

377
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We're not going to do business with you.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We're not going to marry with you.

379
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We're not going to sit and eat food with you.

380
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We're going to boycott you.

381
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
These are the kinds of things the Sahaba had to face when the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was in Makkah.

382
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So you know what that is?

383
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The only reason you will believe is because you are getting something greater than all of these problems.

384
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's called return on investment, right?

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's return on.

386
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If I'm going to lose my friends, I'm going to lose my family, I'm going to lose my money, I'm going to lose my house.

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What am I going to get?

388
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Why am I signing up for this?

389
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And I'm going to get beat up and I'm going to get humiliated and insulted.

390
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Well, you get Iman and Allah will reward you in the next life.

391
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And you get to be loyal to the Prophet.

392
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So the final messenger of God is here and he's standing for the truth.

393
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And you have the honor of standing next to him.

394
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's all you get.

395
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Good enough for you?

396
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, good enough for me.

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's an honor.

398
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They're getting beat up and they're happy.

399
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
They're getting beat up.

400
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
They're getting spit on and they're happy.

401
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
They're getting spit on.

402
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
These are the people.

403
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We call them a sabiqu ala ala walun.

404
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The people who came first, the people who came first.

405
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm going to take a few minutes to explain this to you because this is a really important concept.

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
When someone comes first to something,

407
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
then they lose friends and family.

408
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If you come from a family where everybody's a doctor

409
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and you decide I'm going to sell bicycles,

410
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you're the first one.

411
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm going to start a bicycle store.

412
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm going to have the most successful bicycle business in Europe.

413
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Your father will write you out of your will.

414
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Your mother will contact as many psychiatrists as possible.

415
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They'll even contact a local Imam.

416
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Maybe he can recite some Quran on you.

417
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Because you're doing something that nobody else in the family is doing.

418
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You understand?

419
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So when you break away and you do something else,

420
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
then everybody turns against you.

421
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What kind of support do you have when you do something like that?

422
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Do you have anybody to support you?

423
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
No.

424
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You have to have the strongest kind of personal will

425
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
that you're going to do this even if everybody thinks you're crazy.

426
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And some of these people, like one little boy says,

427
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm going to be a footballer.

428
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm going to win a World Cup.

429
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And then that kid turns into an actual football player

430
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
who eventually ends up winning the World Cup.

431
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And then they tell a historian, say, when did this begin?

432
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well, this began when I was a child.

433
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And there are other boys that say, I want to be a footballer.

434
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I want to win the World Cup.

435
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And their dad says, that's cute. Do your math homework.

436
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That's cute. Sign up for college. Get this job.

437
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So the dream starts getting crushed, doesn't it?

438
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But some people, they don't care what anybody says.

439
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
They fight everybody and they go after their dream

440
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and they even get there.

441
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
0.0001% of people, whatever that small percentage is.

442
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The point is, if you do something new, you lose everyone around you.

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The Sahaba, by believing in the Prophet's Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

444
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
we're doing something new, yes or no?

445
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
We're doing something new.

446
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Nobody did that in their family.

447
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Nobody did that in the tribe.

448
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Nobody's done that for thousands of years.

449
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What are you talking about? Are you crazy?

450
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And because they did that, they are the first comers.

451
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
These people, you know what we call them nowadays?

452
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We call them pioneers.

453
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
In American English, we call them trailblazers.

454
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
They set a new trend.

455
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
They do something nobody's ever done before.

456
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And when they do that, eventually they become heroes in society.

457
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Whether they're in business or in sports or anything.

458
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
When they do something new, everybody's like,

459
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
wow, this person did something so crazy and so new

460
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that nobody had even thought of and they start pioneering something

461
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and it takes over.

462
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And then there's a next wave of people we call them fans or followers.

463
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
In the beginning, that guy is alone or that woman's alone.

464
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But once they reach success, what happens?

465
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Lots and lots of people follow them.

466
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So they become trend setters.

467
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
In the beginning, they're crazy.

468
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Eventually, they're the one to follow.

469
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They're role models.

470
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The Prophet's wife by the time he gets to Medina,

471
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
the Sahaba are already there.

472
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
His loyal followers are already there.

473
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And now, even in Medina, some people are early to follow the Prophet's wife.

474
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And even in Medina, people are like, should we really?

475
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You think he's a prophet of God?

476
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You think an angel talks to him?

477
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's what you think.

478
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And so it would be difficult.

479
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
There are people in Medina that have Jewish background.

480
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
They could say to their family, well, your book is good enough for you.

481
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Moses is good enough for you.

482
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Thotara is good enough for you.

483
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Your rabbi gives such a great sermon every week.

484
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That's not good enough for you.

485
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Why are you becoming Muslim?

486
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What's the matter with you?

487
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
There could be Christian background.

488
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
There could be other background.

489
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And they're starting to accept Islam.

490
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And all their family is losing it.

491
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But as it starts growing, and by the time the Prophet gets to Medina,

492
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,000
actually a huge population of people living in Medina are ready to accept Islam.

493
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's no longer a sacrifice.

494
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Now, the people who follow Islam are not the minority.

495
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
In a sense, they are the powerful majority.

496
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So the world is very different in Medina than it was in Makkah.

497
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Now the Muslims are the winning team.

498
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
They're the winning team.

499
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Because they are the winning team, you then get three kinds of Muslims.

500
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is really important to understand this group of Suras.

501
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You get how many?

502
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Three kinds of Muslims.

503
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You only got one kind of Muslim in Makkah.

504
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Which kind?

505
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The pioneers.

506
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The ones who are ready to sacrifice everything.

507
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That's the only kind of Muslim you get in Makkah.

508
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
When the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam moves to Medina,

509
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
you get the pioneers.

510
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And the pioneers are from Makkah.

511
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And some of them are also from Medina.

512
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Asabikunal awwaluna min al muhajireena wal al-Ansar.

513
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The first and foremost who came from the muhajireen,

514
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and the first and foremost from the Ansar, meaning the people of Medina.

515
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That's group one.

516
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Then there's group two.

517
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
They accept Islam because it makes sense.

518
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Because it's a beautiful message.

519
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But they don't have to give up their family.

520
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
They don't have to give up their job.

521
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
They don't have to give up their home.

522
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Meaning they accept Islam intellectually.

523
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
They accept Islam emotionally.

524
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But it comes without any sacrifices.

525
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's not a major sacrifice.

526
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
By comparison, the pioneers, did they have to make major sacrifices?

527
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yeah.

528
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So is accepting Islam easier now in Medina?

529
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah.

530
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So a good number of people start coming into Islam.

531
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And it's easy.

532
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Sometimes an entire family accepts Islam.

533
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The whole family becomes Muslim.

534
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Easier and easier and easier.

535
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Then there's the third group of people.

536
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The third group of people says,

537
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We were doing pretty good before he got here.

538
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
People used to listen to us.

539
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
People used to follow us.

540
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Now all of a sudden everybody wants to become Muslim.

541
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If we want to stay relevant,

542
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
If we want to be a part of the society,

543
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
then we have to join the winning party.

544
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
We need to accept Islam because if we don't accept Islam,

545
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
everybody else is going to follow the trend.

546
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We're going to be left behind.

547
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Now they're not following Islam.

548
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
They're not coming to Islam because they are interested in Islam.

549
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Or they find it convincing.

550
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But they think it's a good political move.

551
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's a good social move to accept Islam.

552
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You understand.

553
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The Quran calls these people,

554
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Munafiqun, hypocrites.

555
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That's what he calls them.

556
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You get three kinds of Muslims in Medina.

557
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Let me ask you what they are.

558
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What's the first one?

559
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Pioneers.

560
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Then the average Muslims.

561
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
A couple call them the average Muslims.

562
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And the third one?

563
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
The Munafiqun.

564
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But there's a problem with the average Muslims.

565
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Let me tell you something.

566
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What happens with the average Muslims?

567
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The average Muslims came in with or without sacrifice?

568
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Generally without too much sacrifice.

569
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But pretty soon in Medina,

570
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
after a little bit of time,

571
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
is there going to be a need for sacrifice?

572
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah, because Makkah is not sitting still.

573
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The Makkahs are not happy about what happened.

574
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And within six months,

575
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
there's going to be preparation for war.

576
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Which means anybody who accepted Islam,

577
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
is potentially a member of the military.

578
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I just like the prayers.

579
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I thought it was really nice.

580
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The Fatiha sounds so nice.

581
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I just accepted Islam for so beautiful and spiritual.

582
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What is this?

583
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Fighting?

584
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't know how to fight.

585
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm a farmer.

586
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't know how to fight.

587
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
The only fight I ever had was with my wife.

588
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't know how to fight.

589
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
What do you mean?

590
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We're going to bother?

591
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
We're going to bother?

592
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And the people who came for political reasons,

593
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
remember the Munafiqoon?

594
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
They come to the regular Muslims and they say,

595
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
See what you signed up for?

596
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You see what happens?

597
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You miss the days of the past or what?

598
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And the Munafiqoon are trying to pull the average Muslim

599
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
towards their team.

600
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
They also make them into what?

601
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Munafiqoon.

602
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So there's actually Munafiqoon in two categories.

603
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They're two categories.

604
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Now, again, let's understand this picture again.

605
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Because there are three groups,

606
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I want you to use the analogy of if you have a lot of iman,

607
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
it's high temperature.

608
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
If you are basically Muslim, middle temperature.

609
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And if you have no iman,

610
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
or your hypocrite is cold temperature.

611
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
In Makkah, was the average temperature high, middle or low?

612
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It was high.

613
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But in Medina, is the overall temperature going down?

614
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah, so I'm not talking about one percent,

615
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
but overall as a community,

616
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
is the average iman, the overall iman, decreasing.

617
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It is, isn't it?

618
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
To address this problem,

619
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the overall iman is decreasing.

620
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Muslims needed to be given a wake-up call.

621
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Don't fall into being Munafiq.

622
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Don't let your iman die.

623
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You need to increase the temperature or not?

624
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Decrease the temperature.

625
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The goal of these ten surahs is to shake up the Muslims

626
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
to increase the temperature.

627
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
That's what's going on in these ten surahs.

628
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Surat al-Jumu'ah is one of those ten surahs.

629
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Okay?

630
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And that's the overall picture.

631
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I want you to understand the overall picture

632
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and the agenda of these surahs, and that's what that is.

633
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Is that clear to everybody?

634
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Okay?

635
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Now, let's go on.

636
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll skip some of this.

637
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Some things you should know.

638
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
These are some subtle things.

639
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
In the previous group,

640
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
let's see if anybody remembers which surah number to which surah number

641
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
was the previous group.

642
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
50 to 56.

643
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
This is Qaf to Waqya.

644
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Allah talked in every surah,

645
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
He said something or the other about the Quran.

646
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
He said something in every one of them.

647
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
He started with Qaf and Quran in Majid.

648
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Qaf, I swear by the Majestic Quran.

649
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Wa dhakir bil Quranima ya khafu wa'id.

650
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Remind with the Quran, whoever fears my threat.

651
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Remind through the Quran, whoever fears my threat.

652
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That's in surah Qaf number 50.

653
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
In 51, he says

654
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
fa warabbis sama'i wal ard innahu lahakun.

655
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Or innahu lahakun,

656
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
mithlama annakum tantikun.

657
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I swear by the master of the sky and the earth.

658
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It is meaning the Quran is the truth,

659
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
as true as your ability to speak.

660
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Though he's convincing people of the truth of the Quran.

661
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Then he says

662
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
wa dhakir fa ma anta bina'umati rabbika bika'idin wa la majnun.

663
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
In 52, he says,

664
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Remind people, because you are not a mind reader,

665
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and you're not insane like they say.

666
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Am yakuluna sha'irun.

667
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Are they saying he's making poetry?

668
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
He's a poet.

669
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yat rabbasubihi raybal manun.

670
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Let's see how the situation changes.

671
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Maybe somebody will come and kill him.

672
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Maybe his poetry will go out of fashion.

673
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It won't be viral anymore.

674
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Let's just see how things, let's wait and see.

675
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Not that we'll just believe in him yet.

676
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Let's wait and see.

677
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Am yakuluna taqawwalahu.

678
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Are they saying he just makes it up?

679
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But that you quinoon know they're not ready to be convinced.

680
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Fal yatubi hadithi mitnihi inkannu sadaqeen.

681
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Let them bring something even close to it.

682
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
If they're telling the truth.

683
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
What is that a challenge of? Produce something like what?

684
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Here's all the allegations.

685
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
This is what you think the Quran is.

686
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Okay, well, if it's poetry, give me your poetry.

687
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
If it's magic, show me some magic.

688
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
In Surah number 53, he says

689
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
wa ma antaqawwalahu.

690
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
He's not making this up from his own feelings.

691
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
He doesn't speak from his own feelings, his own emotions.

692
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In huwa illa wahyunuha.

693
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This is nothing but revelation that's being given to him.

694
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
In Surah, the Deqsura after Qamar, or after Najam Qamar,

695
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Allah says,

696
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
wa laqad yassarna al-Quran al-dhikri fa hal minwooddhikir.

697
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
We made the Quran easy for people to get reminder.

698
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
We made it easy for them to remember Allah.

699
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Then is there anyone who wants to benefit from that reminder?

700
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You know the famous words about the Quran in Surah Al-Rahman already.

701
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Surah number 55,

702
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
al-Rahmanu al-Rahman.

703
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The most loving, the most caring one.

704
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
He's the one who taught the Quran.

705
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Why do you not realize this is an act of love from Allah?

706
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And then, at the very end of this, in Surah number 56,

707
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
really interesting,

708
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
fa la'uqusimu bimawaqi an-nujum wa inna hulaqasamu allahu ta'alahu na'adhim,

709
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
inna hulaquranu al-karim.

710
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I swear by how the stars are placed in the galaxies.

711
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And that is an amazing oath.

712
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
This is a noble Quran.

713
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
This Quran.

714
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Allah compares the Quran's ayat to the stars in the galaxies.

715
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Which is a deep discussion, but for another time.

716
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I've already done the series on ad-waqya.

717
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But I will tell you this much.

718
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Allah says about the Quran in Surah Al-Baqya,

719
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
the last Surah before this group begins.

720
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
He says something special.

721
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
He says,

722
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
afa bihaathal hadithi an-tumbudheanoon.

723
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You want to play games and negotiate with this book,

724
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
with this speech?

725
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You want to do a negotiation?

726
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
We like this part, we don't like this part.

727
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
This is what you want to do.

728
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
wa ta-jaaluna risqakum annaqum duqadzeeboon.

729
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And you think that you can just keep your provisions, your rizq.

730
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Meaning, the real reason you want to play games with the Quran,

731
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
with this revelation, is because you don't want to lose out on your money,

732
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
or your assets, or your social power.

733
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So you want to take the parts of the Quran that allow you to keep your current assets

734
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and your business, and your politics, and your social standing, exactly how it is.

735
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And everything that challenges that, you want to put that aside.

736
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That's the negotiation you want to do.

737
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
This was important because in the coming Surahs, the group we're dealing with,

738
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Allah will talk a lot about the hypocrites.

739
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Now you understand why?

740
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And what do the hypocrites want to do?

741
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
They want to compromise the word of Allah.

742
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
They want to protect their assets.

743
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
They want to protect their political standing.

744
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
By the end of the last group, we were already mentally prepared for what's coming in this group.

745
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Something special that happens in this group, moving from the previous group,

746
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
is Allah doesn't just talk about the Quran, which He will, in practically every Surah.

747
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
He'll also mention something about the Quran from 57 to 66.

748
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But He'll add something.

749
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This time it's going to be about loyalty to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

750
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This is actually going to, the Prophet's going to keep coming up.

751
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
He'll treat the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

752
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And what the Prophet does for you, like in 57, he says Allah sent His ayat,

753
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
His revelations to His slave, meaning the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam,

754
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
so he can bring you out of darknesses into light.

755
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Allah didn't just mention the Quran, He mentioned the Prophet, His slave.

756
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
He highlights him.

757
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Then He will keep mentioning, oh, believe in His Messenger and believe in His book.

758
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You know?

759
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And He'll allow you to walk in light.

760
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So that now, it's not just in the previous group, it was a focus on the Quran.

761
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And now there's a focus on the Quran and the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

762
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
This is really important, especially for Medina.

763
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Why?

764
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Because people say, yeah, of course I believe in God.

765
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I believe in the afterlife.

766
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah.

767
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, why do I have to go to war?

768
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Just because He's saying it?

769
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I mean, He's just another man like us.

770
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Okay, fine, He's a Prophet, but we don't have to follow Him in everything.

771
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I mean, these guys are crazy.

772
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Look at these people.

773
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
They became homeless following Him.

774
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
They're living here on welfare in Medina, even though they had homes and families in Makkah.

775
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
These people are idiots.

776
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You want me to be like these idiots?

777
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Anubinu kama amanasufaha.

778
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
We should believe like these idiots believe.

779
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's in the Quran.

780
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That's what they said.

781
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
In other words, their loyalty to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, made them bankrupt.

782
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Their loyalty ruined their life.

783
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So they're trying to question.

784
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You should follow the Prophet.

785
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Pray with Him.

786
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
That's fine.

787
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Listen to some inspirational speeches.

788
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That's good.

789
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But if He's asking you for bigger sacrifices, come on.

790
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We're not crazy.

791
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
That's too much.

792
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That's too extreme.

793
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
We're not going to take that route.

794
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You understand?

795
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So now it was important to highlight loyalty to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, in these surahs.

796
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay, now, actually, I want to skip this part.

797
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I want to show you this diagram.

798
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't know if it's going to make any sense to you, but I'm going to try.

799
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So on the left side, it says, this bih.

800
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You guys know what this bih has?

801
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Anyone know what this bih has?

802
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Saying Subhanallah.

803
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
What does Subhanallah mean?

804
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We'll have a discussion today about it, but after this introduction today, the only thing we will get done is

805
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
ayah number one, hopefully.

806
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Hopefully.

807
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Okay, so that's as far as we can go today.

808
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But anyway, this bih means to declare Allah as perfect.

809
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So when you say Subhanallah, you are saying, I declare that Allah is perfect or Allah is flawless.

810
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Flawless.

811
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
When you say something about Allah or you believe about Allah, that anything that would take away from His perfection,

812
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
you have removed it from your mind.

813
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
That would be the bih.

814
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay, so in a sense, you can say, you know what detox is?

815
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Right?

816
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You detox your concept of God from any impurities.

817
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
That's called this bih.

818
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That's actually, so removing all the negative.

819
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Removing all the negative.

820
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That's this bih.

821
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Hound is something else.

822
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Hound is adding all the positive.

823
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
This bih removes all the negative and Hound adds all the positive.

824
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That's the two sides of it.

825
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You cannot add Hound without first doing what?

826
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Tasbih.

827
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You're gonna do Tasbih first.

828
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But you can't just do Tasbih because just because you say Allah is perfect, He doesn't have any flaws.

829
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You still haven't said anything good about Him.

830
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You just didn't say anything bad about Him.

831
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That's not good enough.

832
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So there's Subhanallah, but there's also what?

833
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Alhamdulillah, they go together.

834
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Al-Ad-Dukr'an.

835
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Fasabbih bih-Hamdi Rabbika.

836
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Meaning do Tasbih with the Hound of your Rabb.

837
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Meaning first remove all the negative, detox your concepts of God to make them pure, and then add the positive.

838
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You understand?

839
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,000
These surahs, the ones that are marked in green, meaning 57 Hadid, 59 Hasher, 61 Mumtahana, 62,

840
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
or Saf, sorry 61 Saf, 62 Jumu'an, 64 Ta'abun.

841
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
These are the ones that begin with Tasbih.

842
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So half of them begin with Tasbih.

843
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
That's an important observation.

844
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Tasbih is one of the main themes in this group.

845
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So half of them get it.

846
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Another thing that keeps coming up in these surahs is in fact spending.

847
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Spending keeps coming up one way or the other.

848
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,000
In 57, 58, 59, skip 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65.

849
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Spending, spending, spending, spending, spending.

850
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The last one is interesting.

851
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
In 65, it's actually spending on in family matters.

852
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Spending not related to battle, but in family matters.

853
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Hypocrisy, which I mentioned to you is the problem.

854
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Where does it come up?

855
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
How does it come up?

856
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Where does it come up?

857
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Every one of them.

858
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Every one of them.

859
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And then the last ones, I changed the color a little bit.

860
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Not because I ran out of ink, but because it is being talked about more indirectly.

861
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It's there, but not as direct as the other surahs.

862
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Then of course, this is really interesting.

863
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Two things that seem like they have nothing to do with each other.

864
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What are the last two items?

865
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Family and what?

866
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Prophetic war.

867
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You would think, okay, what the prophet moved to Medina, so now there's the Quraysh

868
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that are going to attack.

869
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
There's going to be wars, but that is going to happen.

870
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Uhud is going to happen.

871
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
These are the battles and the life of the prophet and many small battles in between.

872
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So there's war matters.

873
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And of course, when you talk about war, there's a goal.

874
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Once we win, we will establish government.

875
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And when we establish government, these will be the laws.

876
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
This is how we will deal with murderers.

877
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This is how we will deal with thieves.

878
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
This is how we will deal with criminals, war criminals.

879
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
This is how we will establish justice.

880
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Like there's these big constitutional laws.

881
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You would think you would talk about those, but what the Qur'an does is he talks in these surahs about prophetic war.

882
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And then instead of talking about the constitutions that will come after winning the prophetic war, he talks about family law.

883
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
He talks about a lot about husband and wife, actually.

884
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Husband and wife is like surat al-Mujadala, all about husband and wife, all over it.

885
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Surat al-Taghabun, actually even before that, in surat al-Mumtahana, is about husband and wife.

886
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And then you get surat al-Munafiqun.

887
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And then he says,

888
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Don't you have money, you don't have children, you don't have children, that's about children and money.

889
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Don't let them distract you from Allah's remembrance.

890
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
In 64 he says,

891
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Your money and your spouses are a great test for you.

892
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Some people don't read a little too much right now.

893
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The moment I said,

894
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Your money and your spouses are a great test for you.

895
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah.

896
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Haqq, the Qur'an is Haqq.

897
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Surat number 65 is called at-Talaq, the surah of divorce.

898
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Surat al-Tahreem is a surah that begins and ends with actually the spousal relationship,

899
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
guidance on the spousal relation.

900
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And in the middle it says,

901
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Qohan fusakum ahli kumnaara, save yourselves and your families from the fire.

902
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The thing is, I said there seems to be a contrast.

903
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Why would war be mentioned side by side with what?

904
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Family law, family guidance, married life.

905
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
What is the connection between these two things?

906
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
This is actually where you appreciate the philosophy of the Qur'an, the wisdom of the Qur'an.

907
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Allah sent Adam, alayhi salam, to this earth.

908
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And there was three that came down to the earth together.

909
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Adam, Hawa and there was one more.

910
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Iblis, thank you very much.

911
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Alakoum.

912
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Iblis.

913
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And Allah says,

914
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Allah says,

915
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You will be enemies to each other.

916
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
He said, you will be enemies to each other.

917
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So there's three people, three individuals.

918
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Adam, Hawa and Iblis.

919
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And Allah says, you'll be enemies to each other.

920
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
What does that mean?

921
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You too will be enemy of that one?

922
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
No, that's not what that means.

923
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
If I say to three people, you will all be enemies to each other.

924
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
A will be enemy of B.

925
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
A will also be enemy of C.

926
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
B will be enemy of A and C.

927
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
C of A and B, you understand?

928
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's going to go.

929
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So, shaitan's job is to make sure that you become an enemy with who?

930
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The man becomes an enemy too.

931
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And then they become enemies of their children.

932
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And their children become enemies of each other.

933
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And animosity spreads.

934
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That's the whole, it started with man and wife.

935
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Allah is saying in the Qur'an, you solve that conflict.

936
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
You address that conflict.

937
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And you've created peace inside of a family.

938
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
If you've created peace inside of a family,

939
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
you're going to raise children in what?

940
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Peace.

941
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And those children, because they have learned peace,

942
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
will then create families that also have what?

943
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Peace.

944
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Peace will become viral.

945
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
But if you have conflict here,

946
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
then what will you pass down to coming generations?

947
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Conflict.

948
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You'll pass conflict down.

949
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Conflict, conflict.

950
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And you will be enemies to each other.

951
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Now, the Rasul S.A.W. is going to war for the sake of Allah.

952
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And as if Allah is saying,

953
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
if you don't win the battleground of the family,

954
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
then there's no purpose of this war.

955
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
The real victory, the real palace is actually,

956
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
the Book of Allah is implemented in the household.

957
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Now, I'll tell you something that you might think is shocking.

958
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's actually quite true.

959
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
If you think of all the laws that are mentioned in Islam,

960
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and the Quran,

961
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
the Quran is a book of proportions, by the way.

962
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Everything is in proportion.

963
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Like Allah created my body in proportion.

964
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
My fingers are a certain size.

965
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
My legs are a certain size.

966
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
My pinky is not the size of my leg.

967
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Alhamdulillah.

968
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Right?

969
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Everything is in proportion.

970
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Something is small.

971
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Something is big.

972
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Isn't that the case?

973
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Some bones are small.

974
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Some bones are big.

975
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Some nerves are longer.

976
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Some nerves are shorter.

977
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Isn't that the case?

978
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
The Quran, some subjects take up more space.

979
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Some subjects take less space.

980
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Isn't that the case?

981
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And Allah decided all of it.

982
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
This is a design from Allah Himself.

983
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It is designed, the vast majority of the laws mentioned in the Quran

984
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
are family laws.

985
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The vast majority.

986
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You would have number two, maybe financial laws.

987
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Those two take the main stage.

988
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Main space in the Quran.

989
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And within them, the marital relationship and inheritance,

990
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
top items.

991
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
They're top, top items.

992
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
When we don't know the Quran, and we don't study the Quran,

993
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
we have a different picture of where the focus is.

994
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You understand?

995
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
When you actually look and study what Allah is saying,

996
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
and how He's saying it, and where He's placing it.

997
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
One of the most amazing surahs in this series is Surah number 66.

998
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'll just tell you one thing about it because we got to keep moving.

999
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Surah number 66, Surah Tuttahrim.

1000
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It begins with the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

1001
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:32,000
being too influenced by some of his wives who were trying to be controlling.

1002
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
They were trying to be controlling over him.

1003
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Everybody has a right over everybody, but they were trying to make him

1004
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
make something Qalam that Allah didn't make Qalam.

1005
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And then you kind of like, I'll make it easy for you.

1006
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
If you love me, you won't go hang out with your friends ever again.

1007
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Or if you love me.

1008
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Or if you love me, you'll never get your sister,

1009
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and you'll never call your sister because you love me.

1010
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Well, I mean, I love you a little less now.

1011
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Because I still love my sister.

1012
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Husbands can do this, wives can do this.

1013
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You try to make a condition out of love of me.

1014
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You need to cut off a part of yourself.

1015
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
You need to cut out some people from your life.

1016
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You can't, you know, young men or young women, they love doing something.

1017
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
They love art.

1018
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Or they love some guy, love basketball.

1019
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
That is why he says, yeah, okay, no, no, go play basketball, go, go, go.

1020
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Well, why would you stay home?

1021
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I go once a year.

1022
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
No, no, go, go.

1023
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It's okay.

1024
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm fine.

1025
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
What she, she's not, she's saying go, but she's not saying go.

1026
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
She's saying, if you really loved me, you'd give that up.

1027
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You wouldn't go.

1028
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You understand?

1029
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So what happens over time, you build a resentment.

1030
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
If this person doesn't let me be who I am.

1031
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
They're controlling.

1032
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
They're controlling.

1033
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
They're using my love for them as a chain to stop me.

1034
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm not even doing something wrong.

1035
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I just wanted to say salam.

1036
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I just wanted to go see a friend.

1037
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I just wanted to say some people don't, you know, some, some mothers will tell their sons,

1038
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
if you love me, you will do, you will do this, this, this to your wife,

1039
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
or you will say this, this, this to your wife, or you won't talk to her,

1040
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
or you won't do, you'll punish her in this way.

1041
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Mom, go eat a sandwich.

1042
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
This is, this not your space.

1043
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yes, Snickers.

1044
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
That'll be good.

1045
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yeah.

1046
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
The point is, in the beginning, the Prophet was told, don't allow a family member to go beyond their rights,

1047
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
to step on your own rights.

1048
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Don't do that.

1049
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Cause if you do that, then your entire Oma will learn that from you.

1050
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And that will become okay.

1051
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
You are role model.

1052
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So, Allah, you said, this is in the beginning of what's your role?

1053
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
At the end of the Surah, Allah says,

1054
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Prophet, make jihad against the Kuffar, and make jihad against the hypocrites.

1055
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Whoa, now he's being talked to like he's the commander in chief,

1056
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
the general of the Muslim military, you understand?

1057
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And fight those who are trying to create espionage,

1058
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and trying to be traitors from inside, the spies within you, fight them,

1059
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
and fight the enemy outside.

1060
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So the commander in chief is being talked to as the general,

1061
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
and he's being told lead the war, isn't he?

1062
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But is that at the beginning of the Surah at the end?

1063
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
At the end?

1064
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
You would think, between a family issue,

1065
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and war,

1066
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
war for the sake of Allah,

1067
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
what should be in our mind?

1068
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
What is item number one in our head?

1069
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
War.

1070
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Jihad is a bit of law.

1071
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And it's all the way down at the end.

1072
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Why?

1073
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Because that's the first battle.

1074
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That's the priority.

1075
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
That's how humanity was sent down.

1076
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
There's a mindset that's taught in the Zayat.

1077
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
You know, the Quran is not just information, it's a mindset.

1078
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
What is priority?

1079
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Why are you even fighting?

1080
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
What's even the purpose?

1081
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
What's even the purpose?

1082
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You know, in Surat Muhammad, Surat Muhammad is a surah of fighting.

1083
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It's a surah, it's also called Surat Al-Qita, the surah of fighting.

1084
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It says,

1085
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Allah says,

1086
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
if you don't fight, you know what's going to happen?

1087
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You will cause corruption in the land,

1088
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
and you will cut family ties.

1089
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Allah says,

1090
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
the great tragedy of not fighting against the Mushrikun

1091
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
in Makkah, the prophetic war.

1092
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
You know what the real damage of that will be?

1093
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Family ties will be cut.

1094
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
That's what Quran says.

1095
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Remarkable.

1096
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
The thing, the reason I'm making a point to share this with you is,

1097
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
oftentimes we are afraid to talk about why the Prophet fought.

1098
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
What was he fighting for?

1099
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And what's even scarier is when people do talk about the subject,

1100
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
they don't talk about this.

1101
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Which is right there in the book staring at you.

1102
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's important to highlight what Quran, let the Quran speak for itself.

1103
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So this is the neighborhood in which Surat Al-Jumu'a belongs.

1104
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Now just a couple other quick, really subtle and beautiful points.

1105
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
The Tasbih of Allah.

1106
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Let me tell you a phrase so you understand what this all means.

1107
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I'll explain it first.

1108
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Sabbahalillahi ma'fi al-samawati wal-arth.

1109
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Sabbahalillahi ma'fi al-samawati wal-ma'fi al-arth.

1110
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Everything, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth,

1111
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
has always done Tasbih of Allah.

1112
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Hear me again in English.

1113
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Everything that's in the skies, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth,

1114
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
has always done Tasbih of Allah.

1115
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I used has always done.

1116
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yes? Let me use it again.

1117
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Everything, whatever is in the skies, whatever is in the earth,

1118
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
does and will always do Tasbih of Allah.

1119
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
What tense did I use now?

1120
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
The present and future.

1121
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Some of these surahs mentioned the Tasbih of Allah in the past.

1122
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So you find that in Surat Al-Hadeed.

1123
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
In the beginning of Surat Al-Hadeed, you find that in Surat Al-Hashal,

1124
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
you find that in Surat Al-Jumu'a.

1125
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Not Jumu'a, sorry, a Saf.

1126
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And there are three surahs in which the Tasbih has mentioned in the present and the future.

1127
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Everything in the skies and the earth does and will continue to do the Tasbih of Allah.

1128
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
That's mentioned in Surat Al-Hashal and in Jumu'a and in Taha'bun.

1129
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
One surah has both past and present. Which one?

1130
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Which number do you see past and present together?

1131
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Hashr. Hashr opens with the past, ends with the present.

1132
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Okay? But I'm not teaching you Surat Al-Hashr, so I won't tell you why that happens.

1133
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It's pretty cool though. I will tell you something else.

1134
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Every time Allah mentions Tasbih in the past, he mentions fighting.

1135
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
The surahs that begin with Tasbih in the past, they mention prophetic war.

1136
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
The surahs that mentioned Tasbih in the future, they don't mention what?

1137
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Prophetic war. And actually, there's lots to learn here,

1138
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
but one subtle thing I will tell you, the war that was administered to the Prophet,

1139
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
will become a thing of the past.

1140
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
This will be a historic war that will bring the victory of Islam

1141
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and cleanse the house of Allah that was built by Ibrahim, and it's actually meant to become a thing of the past.

1142
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And then Tasbih of Allah forever shall continue.

1143
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
So there's an association of the past with war actually in these surahs,

1144
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
with prophetic war particularly.

1145
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But then there's another really beautiful thing, and that's not happening in this surah,

1146
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
but you should note the perfection of the Quran. Listen to me carefully and tell me the difference.

1147
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth,

1148
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
declares the perfection of Allah. How many times did you hear whatever?

1149
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Good. I'll say it again. Whatever is in the skies and the earth declares the perfection of Allah.

1150
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
How many times did you hear whatever?

1151
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
There's only two places where Allah says whatever once.

1152
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Whatever is in the skies and the earth.

1153
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Everywhere else, He says whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth.

1154
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
He mentions ma twice.

1155
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Subh'Allah, ma fis-sama'u wa tih, wa ma fil-ardhi, ma is twice.

1156
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Other places,

1157
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Subh'Allah, ma fis-sama'u wa tih, wa ad-dhi, just once.

1158
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Now if I told you,

1159
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I know whatever you said and whatever you said and whatever you said,

1160
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and I say, I know whatever you said, you and you and you said,

1161
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
which one is more namble?

1162
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
The second one is more namble. You don't have to say whatever over and again.

1163
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Why are you doing that?

1164
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Because I'm going to come after you, then I'm going to come after you, then I'm going to come after you.

1165
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
There's extra emphasis on every whatever, you understand?

1166
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So when Allah says, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth,

1167
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
declares the perfection of Allah, is there a special stress on the earth?

1168
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You understand?

1169
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
So you'll find in most of these surahs, wherever Tasbih has mentioned,

1170
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
there's a special stress on the earth.

1171
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And what's really cool is Allah will mention that special stress on the earth,

1172
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and immediately in the next ayah, something about the peep us,

1173
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
whatever is happening in the earth will be mentioned, immediately after.

1174
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
There's only two places where that special whatever is on the earth is not mentioned,

1175
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
two places.

1176
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Those two places are Surat al-Hadeed at the beginning,

1177
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
and Surat al-Hashr at the end.

1178
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You sabbi'u lahumaf is samawati wal-arduwa wal-aziz al-hakim.

1179
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
What's amazing about those two places is they only talk about Allah.

1180
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
There's no mention of what's going on in the world.

1181
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
At the end of Surat al-Hashr, you find

1182
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
the earth, no special emphasis on the earth this time,

1183
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,000
because it was all about Allah, and there was no focus on the people of the earth at the end.

1184
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It's only about Allah.

1185
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Go to the beginning of Surat, and if you don't know the Arabic,

1186
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
these were all names of Allah, descriptions of Allah.

1187
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Now you go to the beginning of Surat al-Hadeed.

1188
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Allah is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six days,

1189
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
then He created the earth.

1190
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
He knows what is going on in the earth and what is coming out of it,

1191
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
and what is coming out of the heavens and what is going on in it.

1192
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
He is with you wherever you are.

1193
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And Allah is the One Who makes us see.

1194
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
He is the One Who has the heavens and the earth.

1195
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And if Allah makes things happen again, He will make the night in the fire,

1196
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and He will make the night in the night.

1197
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And He is the One Who knows the same things.

1198
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Allah is the One Who makes things happen.

1199
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
All of it is about Him.

1200
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah.

1201
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
There is no focus in the world.

1202
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Now just be, forget about worldly matters in this passage.

1203
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
The two places that talk about Allah uniquely,

1204
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the Ma is removed.

1205
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
This is just to show you every small detail in the Quran,

1206
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
every word in the Quran has a strategic location and a placement.

1207
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Right? But the one we are dealing with, is there a Ma?

1208
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You sabbi'u lillahi maafi's samawati.

1209
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Maafi lillahi, surat al-jamu'a, there is two Ma's.

1210
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Now, I know my introduction is going to take super long,

1211
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
but should I give you a break now?

1212
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I don't really care about your feelings.

1213
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Surat al-Suf is the surah right before this one.

1214
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
In my study of the Quran, it's important to know what neighborhood a surah belongs to, remember?

1215
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And one of the, so one is what group does it belong to?

1216
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And the other, the other is, who's the immediate neighbor?

1217
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
What's the surah right before and what's the surah right after?

1218
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
So the surah right before, the surah we're about to study, is surat al-Suf.

1219
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Surat al-Suf.

1220
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So the surah begins with, everything has declared the perfection of Allah,

1221
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
sabbaha, the past tense.

1222
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:00,000
This surah is going to begin, every surah declares and will continue to declare the perfection of Allah.

1223
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Between the past, present and future, doesn't that cover all time?

1224
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So they already complement each other because it kind of together, they cover all time.

1225
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And the this was happening since ever and is happening now and will continue to happen forever.

1226
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So all three tenses get covered.

1227
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
In this, in the last surah Allah mentions, what did he send the messenger with?

1228
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
He sent him with guidance.

1229
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
What did he send in with?

1230
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
In this surah we're going to learn, who was he sent to?

1231
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Who was he sent to?

1232
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
There we're going to learn, what was his overall objective?

1233
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
He can make this deen victorious.

1234
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Here, that's the overall of the macro objective.

1235
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You understand macro and micro?

1236
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
That's the macro objective.

1237
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
What's the micro objective?

1238
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Every individual needs to be purified.

1239
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Every individual needs to be transformed.

1240
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
That's going to be in this surah.

1241
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
You find in just two reactions.

1242
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Especially in Makkah, there were two reactions to the Prophet.

1243
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Some people, they were all mushrikun before, they were all mushrikun.

1244
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Some of them, when the Quran came, they hated the Prophet a lot.

1245
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And some of them, when the Quran came, they left their misguidance and accepted Islam.

1246
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
The people who hated the Prophet are mentioned in surah As-Saf,

1247
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
wa laukariha al-mushrikun.

1248
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And the people who came towards Islam and left their shirk,

1249
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
wa inkaanu min qabdu lafiql al-alim mubin are mentioned in this surah.

1250
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
In surah As-Saf, Allah mentioned Musa spoke to his people.

1251
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Who were his people?

1252
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Good, Bani Israel.

1253
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Isa spoke to Bani Israel.

1254
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
And they both were speaking to people who already believed.

1255
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
They were already Muslim, but they weren't living up to Islam.

1256
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Even though they had a Prophet among them.

1257
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And both of these prophets came to which nation?

1258
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Bani Israel.

1259
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
In this surah, you're going to find the example of those who were given the Torah

1260
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
as a responsibility and they did not carry this responsibility.

1261
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Do you see a continuity?

1262
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Musa is the beginning of the Torah.

1263
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Isa is the conclusion of the Torah.

1264
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And now, alladina hummilu tawrat in the next surah.

1265
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,000
So you see, you can see there's a continuity of messaging from one surah to the next surah.

1266
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Allah mentions there, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.

1267
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Allahul-Ayyah delqawwal fasiteen.

1268
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Allahul-Ayyah delqawwal lalimeen.

1269
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
This is mentioned two times in surah As-Saf.

1270
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And in this surah, you'll also find,

1271
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Allahul-Ayyah delqawwal lalimeen.

1272
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Allah does not guide misguide or does not guide the wrongdoing people.

1273
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,000
One of the most amazing contrasts in surah As-Saf, when Allah was encouraging the Muslims

1274
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
to engage in prophetic war when the war was coming towards them,

1275
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
He says,

1276
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
He says,

1277
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Should I tell you of a business deal that will save you?

1278
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Should I tell you of a business deal that will what?

1279
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Save you.

1280
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And Allah mentions tijara again in this surah.

1281
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
He says, when the Prophet, peace be upon him, was standing giving khudba,

1282
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
there was some trade show going on, some caravan.

1283
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You know, nowadays you can buy, you know, clothes and groceries and things like that.

1284
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You can buy them from the mall or from the grocery store.

1285
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And the day they didn't have grocery stores like that,

1286
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,000
people used to bring the items and stop and then they set up a whole camp for your shopping,

1287
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
like a fair, like a market, right?

1288
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Set up a market and then briefly they're there.

1289
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
If you want to catch the best deals, come early and then get out.

1290
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,000
So the Jumar of khudba was going on, Salat al Jumar was going on and this trade fair came.

1291
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And people heard the bells and the, you know, the dancers and the singing songs and all that stuff

1292
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
that they set up to make noise, to attract their customers and a bunch of people left Salat al Jumar

1293
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
and went there.

1294
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Now the good thing nowadays is you don't have to leave the masjid to go to the entertainment.

1295
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
You could just, you don't have to get up.

1296
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It comes to you.

1297
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
You don't have to go to it.

1298
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
But anyway, Allah says,

1299
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
When they saw that trade,

1300
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
they saw something entertaining, they ran towards it.

1301
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
They left you standing there.

1302
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Allah mentions you will fight in the last path and you will spend with your money and your own selves.

1303
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
You'll spend your own life.

1304
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
That would be the ultimate trade.

1305
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And in this Surah, Allah will say that the death that you are running away from, it will catch you.

1306
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
There's no way that you'll escape.

1307
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
In the Mouta,

1308
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
LaDhi Taferruna Minhu.

1309
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:45,000
One of my most interesting, most favorite comparisons of these two Surahs is actually about Jesus.

1310
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
So if you don't know, the followers of Jesus are called the Hawariyun.

1311
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
The Bible calls them the disciples.

1312
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
The disciples of Jesus.

1313
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
They weren't many.

1314
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
They were very few.

1315
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And after whatever happened in his mission, they were all spread out.

1316
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Like, they didn't win the battle.

1317
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
You understand?

1318
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
They were dispersed because they were so few.

1319
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And it took a couple of centuries before the Christianity or the some version of following Jesus made a comeback.

1320
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But for a long time, it was just dispersed in the early mission of Jesus.

1321
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:37,000
By contrast, in this Surah, Allah says that Allah sent this messenger among people that had no education before, the Arabs.

1322
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And there are others who haven't joined them yet, who are coming.

1323
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Who's he talking about?

1324
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Others who haven't joined them yet.

1325
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Hey, he's talking about us.

1326
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
He's talking about us.

1327
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:01,000
He's talking about Islam going to Europe, Islam going to Africa, Islam going to Asia, Islam reaching Australia, Islam going everywhere.

1328
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's going to go everywhere.

1329
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And the numbers are going to what?

1330
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And is it going to be many centuries of Islam disappearing and then it will appear?

1331
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
No, no, no.

1332
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
From the very beginning, Islam keeps spreading and spreading it.

1333
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
This is the Fadl of Allah.

1334
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
That's the favor of Allah.

1335
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
He gives it to whoever he wants.

1336
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
That is not how things played out in the mission of Jesus.

1337
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
But this is how things are going to happen in the mission of Muhammad.

1338
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So, Allah, you guys seen, I mean, don't answer this publicly isn't people might stare at you.

1339
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
You guys seen the Hollywood side in LA on the mountain?

1340
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yeah, it's okay.

1341
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I was in an island in Malaysia, Kotakina, Peru, some time ago.

1342
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And this is like, you fly out of Kuala Lumpur a couple of hours, you're going over the ocean and you landed this remote island.

1343
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It's like a vacation island thing.

1344
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I was just on the plane.

1345
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I was just looking out at the sea and I was thinking,

1346
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
how did Islam gear?

1347
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Like this is so far.

1348
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And there's so much water in between.

1349
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Like Allah's word just went everywhere.

1350
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And then I land in Kotakina, Peru and we're driving and it was a good hour and a half drive.

1351
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And I see a mountain.

1352
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And on the mountain, there's a calligraphy giant sign that says Allah.

1353
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Like the Hollywood side, except not to join them.

1354
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It was as a...

1355
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I was just baffled like, look at this.

1356
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
These people want to just, they're driving and they're like, oh yeah, I should remember Allah.

1357
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
You know?

1358
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:59,000
To me, this Acharina Minhum, the blessing Allah gave to this online, the way that it spread,

1359
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
is one of the most amazing miracles of this religion.

1360
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
One of the most amazing things.

1361
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Finally, I'm going to share a quick comparison with you about Surat Al-Jumu'a and Surat Al-Munafiq.

1362
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
At the end of Surat Al-Jumu'a, Allah says the people left the Prophet standing.

1363
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
He was giving khutbah and the people left.

1364
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
People walked away to that trade.

1365
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Right?

1366
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And the beginning of Surat Al-Munafiq, when some people come to the Prophet.

1367
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So look at the imagery.

1368
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
At the end of one Surat, people are walking away from the Prophet.

1369
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
In the beginning of the next one, people are coming to the Prophet and they're both wrong.

1370
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
They're both wrong.

1371
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
The ones who walked away got distracted and the ones who come are hypocrites trying to impress him.

1372
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
They're coming for ingenuine reasons.

1373
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
So, Al-Jumu'a says he gives people revelation.

1374
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
He teaches people revelation so he can purify them.

1375
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And then there are people who hear this revelation but it doesn't purify them.

1376
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
They take their faith as a shield to hide their real dirtiness.

1377
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So they're believers on the outside but really not believers on the inside.

1378
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And that's highlighted in Surat Al-Munafiq.

1379
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Allah says the people before us, they were given the responsibility of the Torah but they didn't carry it.

1380
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
They were burdened but they didn't carry it.

1381
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
This Surah says, hypocrites, they believed then they disbelieved.

1382
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
You know why that's important?

1383
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,000
When Allah talks about the Israelites in the Quran, he's actually not really only talking about the Israelites.

1384
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
This is really important.

1385
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
When he's talking about the Israelites, who do you think he's talking about?

1386
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
He's talking about us.

1387
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
This is a really important principle of the Quran. It happens over and over again.

1388
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
They were talked about.

1389
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
By the way, the word used for them will be indisputably, method, their example.

1390
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
When is a teacher given example? When is a parent given example?

1391
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
The example is given to benefit the student.

1392
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
The example is not the goal.

1393
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
The example is just a means to learn the lesson for you.

1394
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So when Allah says, muthel for them, it's because, look at what a lesson is about but he's like,

1395
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
No, he said that because you look like that, homie.

1396
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
That's why he's saying it.

1397
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
There's a direct correlation being made.

1398
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So I'll quickly run to the end of this.

1399
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Allah says in Surat Al-Jumu'ah, he says, fas'aw ila dikr illa, rush to the remembrance of Allah.

1400
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:38,000
In Surat Al-Mulafiq, he flips it and says, don't let your money and kids distract you from the remembrance of Allah.

1401
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,000
In Surat Al-Jumu'ah, he says, remember Allah a lot so you can succeed.

1402
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I'll say that again. Remember Allah a lot so you can what?

1403
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Succeed. Okay, okay. What's the opposite of succeed?

1404
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
He says, wama yafa'al dalika fa'u laika humul khasirun in the next Surat.

1405
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And whoever gets distracted from remembering Allah, those are the people that have failed.

1406
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
One Surah says, remember Allah to succeed.

1407
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
The other says, you get distracted and you will what?

1408
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Fail. You see a connection?

1409
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And I wanted to illustrate this to you so you understand how Surahs move in like there's a structure, there's a method, there's a continuity.

1410
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And this is your concluding comment and I'll give you guys a good, you've earned a good 10 minute break.

1411
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Mashallah, you've been very good. So I'm going to give you your first 10 minute break soon.

1412
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
These are the three sections of Surat Al-Juva'ah.

1413
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
It's 11 ayat, but it's going to be broken up into three sections.

1414
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And hopefully today we can do one ayah from the first section.

1415
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Hopefully. I don't think it's going to happen now, but this is what we're going to go through.

1416
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And at the whenever we reach the end of a section, I'll give you an overview of that section.

1417
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Then we'll get to the end of the second section and an overview.

1418
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Then the third one, then an overview of the entire Surah.

1419
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And this is sort of my method in giving these lectures on the Surahs and Shah-i-Llutada.

1420
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
So with that, I'm going to give you guys your first 10 minute break.

1421
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And within 10 minutes, I'll be back here talking again.

1422
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Jazakumul Alaykum.
