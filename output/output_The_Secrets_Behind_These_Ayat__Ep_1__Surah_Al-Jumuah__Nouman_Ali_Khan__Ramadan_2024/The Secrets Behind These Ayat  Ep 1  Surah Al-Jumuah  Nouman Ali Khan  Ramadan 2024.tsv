0	9000	We're just just imagine for a moment every time you enter a surah, you're entering into one of Allah's palaces.
9000	15000	This surah from Allah is a gift sent from above the seven heavens to humanity
15000	20000	and you're entering something that the world did not have access to it.
20000	26000	This came from way way above and it came as a gift to humanity.
27000	32000	We'll take a deep look at Surat Al-Jumu'ah as deep as I can do at least
32000	37000	and there's still endless oceans left after whatever I'm able to do.
37000	41000	But whatever I try to do, I will try to simplify as much as possible.
41000	46000	That's how humanity was sent down. There's a mindset that's taught in the Zayat.
46000	51000	You know the Quran is not just information, it's a mindset. What is priority?
51000	57000	So what Allah says, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth
57000	62000	declares the perfection of Allah. Is there a special stress on the earth?
62000	67000	You understand. So you'll find in most of these surahs wherever Tasbih has mentioned
67000	70000	there's a special stress on the earth.
70000	74000	And what's really cool is Allah will mention that special stress on the earth
74000	76000	and immediately in the next ayah
76000	79000	Surat Al-Jumu'ah
80000	82000	Peace be upon you.
84000	86000	Alhamdulillah, Lord of the worlds.
86000	90000	Peace be upon the Sadaqah, the messengers, his family and companions.
90000	93000	We've been waiting for him to come to Yuma-ddin.
93000	96000	Allah has made us from them, from those who believe and do righteous deeds
96000	100000	and are in the right path and are patient and secure, Lord of the worlds.
101000	107000	I'd like to first express to you how excited I am and how happy I am to see so many of you
107000	112000	and I know that many of you have driven long distances to come and attend this program.
112000	118000	Insha'Allah Ta'ala, I pray to Allah that he counts all of this as ibadah for him
118000	122000	and that he includes us among that hadith that was mentioned by the Imam.
122000	124000	Khayru kumman ta'alam al-Qur'anah wa'alamahu.
124000	128000	The best of you are the ones who learn the Quran and then teach it.
128000	134000	So what I'm going to start with is an introduction just so you all have an idea
134000	138000	how these lectures are going to go, how these discussions are going to go
138000	140000	and what the plan is for them.
140000	146000	For this entire week, if those of you that are committed to coming the entire week with me,
146000	149000	we're going to be studying Surah al-Jumu'at.
149000	154000	So we're going to be just doing one Surah of the Quran and it's only 11 ayat.
154000	156000	It's not long at all.
156000	162000	So it's only 11 ayat, but it's going to take us a whole week to study that Surah.
162000	165000	Somebody asked me on the way here, actually a volunteer asked me on the way here,
165000	170000	are you going to be like very high level or are you going to talk to the rest of us?
170000	173000	So I need to address that question.
173000	179000	My job is to try to study the Quran as deeply as I can
179000	183000	and address some of the hardest questions I can address.
183000	188000	In my own investigation with my team, with other researchers and scholars.
188000	191000	And then that's the easy part of my job.
191000	195000	The hard part of my job is to learn all of whatever I can learn
195000	199000	and then to simplify it so that human beings can understand it.
199000	204000	Because scholars and students, they speak some kind of alien language
204000	206000	that the rest of us don't understand.
206000	211000	So I need to make sure that I explain things to you in a way
211000	214000	that makes sense to you, that you can grasp.
214000	217000	Some concepts are difficult, they're more complicated,
217000	220000	but I'm going to do my best to keep things as simple as possible.
220000	222000	So there's two different things.
222000	226000	One, you want to talk about complicated things,
226000	230000	but two, you want to talk about them in simple language.
230000	232000	And you have to have that balance.
232000	235000	Because sometimes people just talk about simple things,
235000	238000	that's not healthy because life is complicated.
238000	241000	There are some complicated things we need to talk about.
241000	243000	And then what happens is when people know,
243000	247000	people have more knowledge than they start using more complicated language
247000	250000	to talk about that, you know, university professor language,
250000	252000	and then nobody understands.
252000	256000	And then those discussions remain in certain circles in the society
256000	258000	and everybody else doesn't get it.
258000	262000	And this is actually the problem that I felt myself
262000	264000	and I feel that pain for you.
264000	267000	So what I try to do in Sha'Allah and these lectures is yes,
267000	270000	we will take a deep look at Surat al-Jumu'ah,
270000	272000	as deep as I can do at least.
272000	277000	And there's still endless oceans left after whatever I'm able to do.
277000	281000	But whatever I try to do, I will try to simplify as much as possible.
281000	287000	Now, having said that, I'm going to speak to you for about 40 minutes,
287000	289000	45 minutes at a time.
289000	293000	The moment I see some of you traveling into the spiritual world,
293000	298000	some of you do this in very creative ways.
298000	302000	Some of you look like you're just really concentrating on the material,
302000	307000	like, you know, other people fight it.
307000	309000	They fight it by agreeing with me a lot.
309000	311000	Like even if I'm not saying anything, they're like,
311000	316000	like slowly declining.
316000	318000	I've seen the brothers do this a lot,
318000	320000	like they'll be sitting in the masjid floor,
320000	322000	they're sitting, for instance, sitting like this,
322000	325000	and they're sitting like this, and they're sitting like this.
325000	330000	And eventually, you know.
330000	334000	So, but 40 minutes at a time, then I'm going to give you guys a break.
334000	336000	I know there's lots of sisters, lots of brothers here.
336000	338000	So what I'm going to try to do in those breaks,
338000	340000	the breaks will be five to seven minutes long.
340000	345000	I believe Maghrib is around 9.20, so we have about two hours before Maghrib.
345000	348000	Tomorrow onwards, I'll start exactly at seven o'clock,
348000	351000	because I want to make the most of the time we have.
351000	354000	So seven, maybe five to 10 minute break in those breaks,
354000	358000	you can come up to me or I can go in that middle area so I can hear from brothers and sisters.
358000	362000	We can have some conversations, take whatever questions.
362000	368000	The breaks are dedicated for questions and discussions and comments.
368000	371000	Those are the most valuable pictures can wait.
371000	373000	I'm here a whole week.
373000	377000	We'll figure out a system and we'll do all the pictures you need to do.
377000	379000	No problem. I have no problem with it.
379000	383000	But in the breaks, I'd rather just focus on conversations.
383000	387000	This is what I'm going to do, but now let me tell you what I expect from you.
387000	391000	This week, I want you to use your imagination.
391000	399000	If you walked into a historical palace, an ancient palace,
399000	403000	when you walk in, people walk in with their cameras,
403000	409000	and they're making video of every door and every decoration
409000	412000	and the ceiling and the windows and all that stuff, right?
412000	417000	Or the artwork on the wall or the calligraphy and things like that, right?
417000	421000	Tourists are just, wow, this is amazing, that kind of thing, right?
421000	427000	Because this represents the work of a great king of the past.
427000	432000	Just imagine for a moment, every time you enter a sura,
432000	436000	you're entering into one of Allah's palaces.
436000	442000	This sura from Allah is a gift sent from above the seven heavens to humanity.
442000	447000	You're entering something that the world did not have access to it.
447000	450000	This came from way, way above.
450000	452000	And it came as a gift to humanity.
452000	454000	Tanzilum merrabil alameen.
454000	459000	What happens in the Quran, if you've even read the Quran in translation,
459000	463000	you will know the Quran has a lot of repetition, right?
463000	466000	The Quran talks about judgment day, and then it talks again about judgment day,
466000	468000	and again about judgment day.
468000	471000	The Quran talks about one prophet, like Musa'a alayhi s-salam,
471000	475000	and it'll talk about him again and again and again and again, right?
475000	478000	So there are many subjects in the Quran that keep repeating.
478000	481000	And what happens to you and me is when we look at that and we say,
481000	483000	oh, I already know that part.
483000	485000	Oh, I already read that before.
485000	486000	I've seen that before.
486000	488000	Show me something new.
488000	490000	Where's the cool stuff?
490000	491000	Where's the new stuff?
491000	494000	Because we're always into something new, right?
494000	499000	And now because of TikTok and Instagram and all this other stuff and YouTube reels,
499000	502000	now we're addicted to something new.
502000	505000	Like you can't, if you're watching one clip, one clip,
505000	506000	then you see an older clip.
506000	508000	I've already seen this.
508000	511000	You get annoyed if you see something you've already seen.
511000	516000	So we become addicted to newer forms of entertainment.
516000	518000	But the way I want you to think about this,
518000	526000	the way I describe this to my students is every surah is like a palace designed by Allah.
526000	532000	And there's another palace designed by Allah and they may have similar bricks,
532000	534000	or they may have similar windows.
534000	536000	But does that make them the same palace?
536000	537000	No.
537000	540000	Are the doors being used exactly in the same way?
540000	543000	Is the flow exactly the same?
543000	545000	Is the exterior and the interior exactly the same?
545000	550000	No, every bit of art has its own unique identity, doesn't it?
550000	552000	Think of an easier example nowadays.
552000	553000	Forget about architecture.
553000	555000	Think about cars, right?
555000	560000	There's one manufacturer, clearly a couple of big manufacturers in this town, right?
560000	563000	And they have lots of different models.
563000	566000	And those models have a lot in common, don't they?
566000	569000	But each model has its own unique identity too, doesn't it?
569000	571000	It has its own features.
571000	576000	Unique exterior, interior, the mechanics, the technology.
576000	578000	There's some variation all the time.
578000	583000	What I want you to think about when you study the Quran is you're not trying to study the entire Quran.
583000	586000	Just give yourself to one surah.
586000	588000	Really give yourself to one surah.
588000	590000	And this surah is super short.
590000	592000	It's like not even two pages.
592000	594000	It's really, really short.
594000	597000	So what I want you to do this week is just the whole week,
597000	600000	read this surah over and over again.
600000	605000	Just before this lecture, after this lecture, just read the surah and ask yourself,
605000	607000	what is Allah saying here?
607000	609000	What does He want from me here?
609000	610000	What does this mean?
610000	613000	Ask whatever questions come to your mind.
613000	616000	Start documenting your questions about this surah.
616000	618000	The questions I want to discuss with you in this week,
618000	620000	I'll take some of your other questions too.
620000	628000	But I don't want to hear your, like, don't worry about the questions about nail polish or halal meat from McDonald's
628000	634000	or just, you know, those questions will be there before this program
634000	637000	and those questions will be there after this program.
637000	638000	But you know what?
638000	641000	Let's surrender our questions to the Quran for a week.
641000	646000	I'm calling it Quran week because I want this to be a week of just Quran for you.
646000	650000	You just immerse yourself completely into it.
650000	655000	Now, we're going to start talking about surah al-Jum'ah because we are short on time.
655000	660000	These slides are not there to make your life easy at all.
660000	662000	They are there to make my life easy.
662000	668000	Okay, so this is you getting, you know how when you use an app, it's easy to follow,
668000	671000	but you don't see the programming code behind it.
671000	675000	I'm showing you some of the code, not all of the code, some of the code,
675000	678000	but that's for me to navigate so you get some idea.
678000	683000	If you, even if you take these pictures, you're not going to use them in your, like,
683000	684000	you're never going to look at them again.
684000	685000	But that's okay.
685000	686000	But I'm still going to walk.
686000	690000	This helps me organize my thoughts and everything I want to share with you.
690000	693000	Some of these things you can take a picture of, you might benefit from,
693000	695000	but most of the time it is complicated.
695000	697000	So don't trust the slides.
697000	701000	You know those professors that put a slide on the screen and everybody's focused on the slide
701000	703000	and nobody's listening to the professor?
703000	705000	That's what I don't want happening.
705000	707000	This is for me as my aid.
707000	710000	What will help you is my explanation.
710000	711000	That's what's going to help you.
711000	713000	So don't turn this into a distraction for yourself.
713000	721000	Regardless, in my study of the Quran, I've come to believe that the surahs of the Quran are in groups.
721000	723000	They are in groups.
723000	727000	So, you know, there's 114 surahs in the Quran, right?
727000	730000	And you'll see, for example, Surat al-Baqarah.
730000	732000	What's after Surat al-Baqarah, people?
732000	734000	Ali-Imran, what's after Ali-Imran?
734000	736000	Nisa and what's after Nisa?
736000	737000	Ma'ida.
737000	742000	So, Baqarah, Ali-Imran, Nisa and Ma'ida are four very large surahs.
742000	747000	All four of them were given to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, when he was in Medina.
747000	752000	So, they're very large and they're all from Medina and they're all together.
752000	754000	So, those four surahs are a what?
754000	755000	They're a group.
755000	760000	And when you study them carefully, you will see there's very deep connections between the four surahs.
760000	763000	They are together for a reason.
763000	771000	When you go further in the Quran, you look at Surat al-Alam and Surat al-A'raf, two very large Makkan surahs.
771000	775000	So, there were four Maddini surahs and then two what?
775000	779000	Makkan. Makkan surah means the Prophet got them when he was in Makkah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, right?
779000	781000	Those two surahs are very, very large.
781000	784000	Makkan surahs are usually not that large.
784000	787000	There are some relatively, but these are the largest ones.
787000	791000	And these two are together and they're very closely related to each other.
791000	793000	They become a group, just a group of two.
793000	798000	And then you see two very large Maddini surahs again.
798000	800000	Anfaal and Tawbah.
800000	803000	And they're also deeply connected to each other.
803000	810000	So, what that does is you're studying a surah, but you also have to figure out what neighborhood does it belong to?
810000	812000	Which group does it belong to?
812000	815000	Which other surah complements it?
815000	817000	And what group of surahs came before?
817000	819000	And how is the conversation proceeding?
819000	824000	In every book, many of you are university students or university graduated.
824000	829000	In any book, in any subject, there is a logic to the sequence.
829000	835000	If you can't understand what the logic is to the sequence, you can't understand the book.
835000	836000	You can't make sense of it.
836000	845000	But a lot of times in our study of the Quran, we think that this order of the Quran is just something that the Muslims decided to agree on.
845000	850000	But this is actually not the real order of the Quran as intended by Allah.
850000	853000	I strongly disagree with that philosophy.
853000	855000	I believe Allah Himself said,
857000	862000	A book in which its ayat were stitched together.
862000	864000	Stitch together when you stitch something.
864000	867000	Every stitch is perfectly placed or no.
867000	870000	Every stitch is exactly where it's supposed to be.
870000	873000	And the word, the fact that even Allah called it Kitab.
873000	875000	Kitab doesn't mean speech.
875000	877000	Kitab means what?
877000	880000	Book and book is not a Word document.
880000	882000	A book is not a Google Doc.
882000	886000	A book back in the day is something that was carved or scratched.
886000	892000	When you carve something or write something or scratch something, can you change the order anymore?
892000	898000	No, so if Allah is calling the entire Quran a Kitab, this actually among many other evidences,
898000	902000	the book was intended to be in this order from Allah.
902000	903000	From Allah.
903000	905000	Just like when you say,
906000	910000	Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, Malik Yom Iddin, there's an order, right?
910000	912000	And you cannot change that order.
912000	913000	You cannot say,
913000	916000	Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim first, Alhamdulillah, Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, second.
916000	917000	You can't do that.
917000	918000	There's a set order.
918000	922000	The same way there's an order within the ayat of the Quran,
922000	924000	there's an order to the entire Quran.
924000	928000	And when you observe that order, you learn a lot.
928000	930000	So we're going to go into every ayah of the Surah,
930000	934000	but first I want you to know what neighborhood does it belong to, right?
934000	938000	And this is right next to another group of Surahs.
938000	939000	So I'm going to start there.
939000	941000	This is Surah number, by the way.
941000	942000	Anybody know the Surah number?
942000	943000	Very good.
943000	944000	62.
944000	947000	The group before this one is 50 to 56.
947000	949000	Qaf Tawakya.
949000	951000	That's the previous group.
951000	954000	And that group is all Makki Surahs.
954000	956000	When I say Makki Surahs, what do I mean?
956000	960000	Surahs given to the Prophet, S.A.W. in Makkah, right?
960000	962000	In the early period, the first 13 years.
962000	965000	Those Surahs have a lot of commonalities.
965000	968000	I've already covered a series of those Surahs.
968000	973000	And in those Surahs, one of the things you learn is Allah is constantly warning those who don't believe.
973000	976000	He's warning people who don't believe in the afterlife.
976000	978000	He's warning people who don't believe in the Quran.
978000	979000	He's giving them warning.
979000	983000	So the people in Makkah who don't believe are the target audience,
983000	987000	and particularly the wealthiest among them.
987000	990000	So actually, it's also a mistake to think,
990000	993000	Oh, the Quran was attacking everybody in Makkah.
993000	995000	I was criticizing all these Makkah Mushriqin.
995000	996000	It wasn't like that.
996000	1000000	Actually, the Quran, when it attacked, or when it was aggressive,
1000000	1004000	it was aggressive with the elite of Makkah,
1004000	1008000	the elite politicians, the multi-millionaires, etc.,
1008000	1012000	who were using their money and their influence to attack Islam.
1012000	1014000	Those were the ones it was coming after.
1014000	1016000	They're called Al-Mutrafeen.
1016000	1017000	They're called Mata'ana bihi az-wajam.
1017000	1021000	And different phrases are used in the Quran to describe that group of people,
1021000	1023000	and Allah goes after them directly.
1023000	1024000	And you will study.
1024000	1026000	If you study Quran carefully, especially Makkah in the Quran,
1026000	1029000	you will find Allah keeps highlighting,
1029000	1032000	Have you seen the one who has this much money and he doesn't give?
1032000	1034000	Have you seen the one who wastes his money like this?
1034000	1036000	Have you seen the one who, you know,
1036000	1039000	spends to make sure that people don't listen to the Quran, etc.?
1039000	1041000	They say this, they say this.
1041000	1043000	It's not everybody who's saying this.
1043000	1046000	There's a group of people that have a lot of power and a lot of money,
1046000	1049000	and they're using that power and influence and money
1049000	1052000	to attack the mission of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
1052000	1054000	and the Quran is responding to them.
1054000	1057000	The huge population of Makkah, many of them,
1057000	1060000	they're just quietly watching what's happening.
1060000	1064000	They're not on this side or that side, they're just spectators, you understand?
1064000	1067000	And that's actually what happened when Islam won.
1067000	1070000	Then many of them came to the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
1070000	1072000	and said, What is this?
1072000	1074000	Like, is this a new?
1074000	1076000	I see that you guys broke all the idols.
1076000	1079000	What's going on?
1079000	1081000	Is there a party?
1081000	1083000	And then the Quran said,
1083000	1088000	If one of the Mushrikiin comes to you,
1088000	1091000	one of the idol worshipers comes to you,
1091000	1094000	and says they want your protection, give them your protection
1094000	1097000	until they hear the speech of Allah, because they didn't know.
1097000	1099000	Some of them didn't even know.
1099000	1103000	We read the 23 years of the Seerah of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
1103000	1107000	from Revelation, and we think everybody knew what was happening.
1107000	1109000	No, some people were at home playing on their PlayStation,
1109000	1112000	they had no idea what's happening outside.
1112000	1116000	And they finally got out to do the groceries, and they're like, What is this?
1116000	1119000	The world had changed.
1119000	1120000	So Allah says,
1120000	1123000	That's because these people had no idea.
1123000	1125000	Give them their space.
1125000	1132000	The same way that the Quran criticizes these Mushrikiin,
1132000	1135000	this group, 62, Surat Al-Jum'ah,
1135000	1139000	starts with Surah number 57, Surat Al-Hadeed,
1139000	1142000	and it ends with Surah number 66.
1142000	1146000	So 57 to 66, these are 10 Suras,
1146000	1150000	and they're all Madani, what does that mean?
1150000	1154000	Given to him in Madina, these are short Madani Suras,
1154000	1158000	one after the other, starting from 57, all the way to 66.
1158000	1161000	And one of the things you will notice inside these Suras,
1161000	1165000	is that it is warning not the disbelievers,
1165000	1169000	it's actually warning the believers.
1169000	1170000	It's warning the believers.
1170000	1173000	And I want you to understand why that happens.
1173000	1178000	When the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, started his mission in Makkah,
1178000	1180000	everybody believed.
1180000	1183000	Everybody, actually everybody who believed in him,
1183000	1186000	was completely sincere, is what I meant to say.
1186000	1190000	Everybody who believed in him was losing their family,
1190000	1193000	they were losing money, they were getting beat up,
1193000	1195000	only for believing in him.
1195000	1198000	You get nothing from believing in the Prophet.
1198000	1199000	You get nothing from it.
1199000	1203000	You get beat up, you get insulted, you get attacked,
1203000	1205000	you get kicked out of your home.
1205000	1206000	That's what you get.
1206000	1208000	If you're in Makkah and you believe in the Prophet,
1208000	1214000	because everybody, the elites, they call the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, insane.
1214000	1217000	So if you join him, you are also what?
1217000	1219000	You're also insane.
1219000	1223000	And they say that he's not loyal to his people.
1223000	1226000	And so now you're not loyal to your people.
1226000	1229000	So basically in the tribe, in tribal life,
1229000	1233000	if you're not loyal to your people, you lose your citizenship.
1233000	1234000	That's your citizenship.
1234000	1238000	So if you join the Prophet, in a sense, you've lost your citizenship.
1238000	1240000	We're not going to do business with you.
1240000	1242000	We're not going to marry with you.
1242000	1244000	We're not going to sit and eat food with you.
1244000	1245000	We're going to boycott you.
1245000	1250000	These are the kinds of things the Sahaba had to face when the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was in Makkah.
1250000	1251000	So you know what that is?
1251000	1259000	The only reason you will believe is because you are getting something greater than all of these problems.
1259000	1262000	It's called return on investment, right?
1262000	1263000	It's return on.
1263000	1268000	If I'm going to lose my friends, I'm going to lose my family, I'm going to lose my money, I'm going to lose my house.
1268000	1270000	What am I going to get?
1270000	1272000	Why am I signing up for this?
1272000	1276000	And I'm going to get beat up and I'm going to get humiliated and insulted.
1276000	1281000	Well, you get Iman and Allah will reward you in the next life.
1281000	1283000	And you get to be loyal to the Prophet.
1283000	1287000	So the final messenger of God is here and he's standing for the truth.
1287000	1290000	And you have the honor of standing next to him.
1290000	1292000	That's all you get.
1292000	1293000	Good enough for you?
1293000	1294000	Yeah, good enough for me.
1294000	1295000	It's an honor.
1295000	1297000	They're getting beat up and they're happy.
1297000	1298000	They're getting beat up.
1298000	1300000	They're getting spit on and they're happy.
1300000	1301000	They're getting spit on.
1301000	1303000	These are the people.
1303000	1305000	We call them a sabiqu ala ala walun.
1305000	1308000	The people who came first, the people who came first.
1308000	1312000	I'm going to take a few minutes to explain this to you because this is a really important concept.
1312000	1317000	When someone comes first to something,
1318000	1322000	then they lose friends and family.
1322000	1326000	If you come from a family where everybody's a doctor
1326000	1330000	and you decide I'm going to sell bicycles,
1330000	1333000	you're the first one.
1333000	1335000	I'm going to start a bicycle store.
1335000	1339000	I'm going to have the most successful bicycle business in Europe.
1339000	1343000	Your father will write you out of your will.
1343000	1347000	Your mother will contact as many psychiatrists as possible.
1347000	1349000	They'll even contact a local Imam.
1349000	1354000	Maybe he can recite some Quran on you.
1354000	1357000	Because you're doing something that nobody else in the family is doing.
1357000	1359000	You understand?
1359000	1362000	So when you break away and you do something else,
1362000	1366000	then everybody turns against you.
1366000	1370000	What kind of support do you have when you do something like that?
1370000	1372000	Do you have anybody to support you?
1372000	1373000	No.
1373000	1377000	You have to have the strongest kind of personal will
1377000	1382000	that you're going to do this even if everybody thinks you're crazy.
1382000	1386000	And some of these people, like one little boy says,
1386000	1389000	I'm going to be a footballer.
1389000	1392000	I'm going to win a World Cup.
1392000	1399000	And then that kid turns into an actual football player
1399000	1401000	who eventually ends up winning the World Cup.
1401000	1404000	And then they tell a historian, say, when did this begin?
1404000	1407000	Well, this began when I was a child.
1407000	1410000	And there are other boys that say, I want to be a footballer.
1410000	1411000	I want to win the World Cup.
1411000	1415000	And their dad says, that's cute. Do your math homework.
1415000	1418000	That's cute. Sign up for college. Get this job.
1418000	1422000	So the dream starts getting crushed, doesn't it?
1422000	1425000	But some people, they don't care what anybody says.
1425000	1427000	They fight everybody and they go after their dream
1427000	1429000	and they even get there.
1429000	1434000	0.0001% of people, whatever that small percentage is.
1434000	1440000	The point is, if you do something new, you lose everyone around you.
1440000	1442000	The Sahaba, by believing in the Prophet's Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
1442000	1445000	we're doing something new, yes or no?
1445000	1447000	We're doing something new.
1447000	1449000	Nobody did that in their family.
1449000	1451000	Nobody did that in the tribe.
1451000	1452000	Nobody's done that for thousands of years.
1452000	1455000	What are you talking about? Are you crazy?
1455000	1461000	And because they did that, they are the first comers.
1461000	1464000	These people, you know what we call them nowadays?
1464000	1466000	We call them pioneers.
1466000	1468000	In American English, we call them trailblazers.
1468000	1470000	They set a new trend.
1470000	1472000	They do something nobody's ever done before.
1472000	1476000	And when they do that, eventually they become heroes in society.
1476000	1480000	Whether they're in business or in sports or anything.
1480000	1482000	When they do something new, everybody's like,
1482000	1485000	wow, this person did something so crazy and so new
1485000	1489000	that nobody had even thought of and they start pioneering something
1489000	1491000	and it takes over.
1491000	1497000	And then there's a next wave of people we call them fans or followers.
1497000	1500000	In the beginning, that guy is alone or that woman's alone.
1500000	1503000	But once they reach success, what happens?
1503000	1507000	Lots and lots of people follow them.
1507000	1509000	So they become trend setters.
1509000	1511000	In the beginning, they're crazy.
1511000	1513000	Eventually, they're the one to follow.
1513000	1515000	They're role models.
1515000	1519000	The Prophet's wife by the time he gets to Medina,
1519000	1521000	the Sahaba are already there.
1521000	1524000	His loyal followers are already there.
1524000	1528000	And now, even in Medina, some people are early to follow the Prophet's wife.
1528000	1531000	And even in Medina, people are like, should we really?
1531000	1535000	You think he's a prophet of God?
1535000	1537000	You think an angel talks to him?
1537000	1539000	That's what you think.
1539000	1543000	And so it would be difficult.
1543000	1547000	There are people in Medina that have Jewish background.
1547000	1552000	They could say to their family, well, your book is good enough for you.
1552000	1554000	Moses is good enough for you.
1554000	1556000	Thotara is good enough for you.
1556000	1558000	Your rabbi gives such a great sermon every week.
1558000	1560000	That's not good enough for you.
1560000	1561000	Why are you becoming Muslim?
1561000	1562000	What's the matter with you?
1562000	1564000	There could be Christian background.
1564000	1565000	There could be other background.
1565000	1567000	And they're starting to accept Islam.
1567000	1569000	And all their family is losing it.
1569000	1573000	But as it starts growing, and by the time the Prophet gets to Medina,
1573000	1582000	actually a huge population of people living in Medina are ready to accept Islam.
1582000	1586000	It's no longer a sacrifice.
1586000	1589000	Now, the people who follow Islam are not the minority.
1589000	1592000	In a sense, they are the powerful majority.
1592000	1597000	So the world is very different in Medina than it was in Makkah.
1597000	1600000	Now the Muslims are the winning team.
1600000	1601000	They're the winning team.
1601000	1608000	Because they are the winning team, you then get three kinds of Muslims.
1608000	1612000	This is really important to understand this group of Suras.
1612000	1613000	You get how many?
1613000	1615000	Three kinds of Muslims.
1615000	1618000	You only got one kind of Muslim in Makkah.
1618000	1619000	Which kind?
1619000	1621000	The pioneers.
1621000	1623000	The ones who are ready to sacrifice everything.
1623000	1626000	That's the only kind of Muslim you get in Makkah.
1626000	1629000	When the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam moves to Medina,
1629000	1631000	you get the pioneers.
1631000	1633000	And the pioneers are from Makkah.
1633000	1635000	And some of them are also from Medina.
1635000	1638000	Asabikunal awwaluna min al muhajireena wal al-Ansar.
1638000	1641000	The first and foremost who came from the muhajireen,
1641000	1644000	and the first and foremost from the Ansar, meaning the people of Medina.
1644000	1646000	That's group one.
1646000	1647000	Then there's group two.
1647000	1650000	They accept Islam because it makes sense.
1650000	1653000	Because it's a beautiful message.
1653000	1656000	But they don't have to give up their family.
1656000	1658000	They don't have to give up their job.
1658000	1660000	They don't have to give up their home.
1660000	1663000	Meaning they accept Islam intellectually.
1663000	1666000	They accept Islam emotionally.
1666000	1669000	But it comes without any sacrifices.
1669000	1671000	It's not a major sacrifice.
1671000	1674000	By comparison, the pioneers, did they have to make major sacrifices?
1674000	1675000	Yeah.
1675000	1679000	So is accepting Islam easier now in Medina?
1679000	1680000	Yeah.
1680000	1683000	So a good number of people start coming into Islam.
1683000	1684000	And it's easy.
1684000	1686000	Sometimes an entire family accepts Islam.
1686000	1687000	The whole family becomes Muslim.
1687000	1689000	Easier and easier and easier.
1689000	1692000	Then there's the third group of people.
1692000	1695000	The third group of people says,
1695000	1700000	We were doing pretty good before he got here.
1700000	1702000	People used to listen to us.
1702000	1704000	People used to follow us.
1704000	1707000	Now all of a sudden everybody wants to become Muslim.
1707000	1710000	If we want to stay relevant,
1710000	1712000	If we want to be a part of the society,
1712000	1715000	then we have to join the winning party.
1715000	1719000	We need to accept Islam because if we don't accept Islam,
1719000	1721000	everybody else is going to follow the trend.
1721000	1723000	We're going to be left behind.
1723000	1725000	Now they're not following Islam.
1725000	1729000	They're not coming to Islam because they are interested in Islam.
1729000	1731000	Or they find it convincing.
1731000	1734000	But they think it's a good political move.
1734000	1737000	It's a good social move to accept Islam.
1737000	1738000	You understand.
1738000	1740000	The Quran calls these people,
1740000	1743000	Munafiqun, hypocrites.
1743000	1744000	That's what he calls them.
1744000	1748000	You get three kinds of Muslims in Medina.
1748000	1749000	Let me ask you what they are.
1749000	1751000	What's the first one?
1751000	1752000	Pioneers.
1752000	1754000	Then the average Muslims.
1754000	1756000	A couple call them the average Muslims.
1756000	1757000	And the third one?
1757000	1759000	The Munafiqun.
1759000	1761000	But there's a problem with the average Muslims.
1761000	1762000	Let me tell you something.
1762000	1764000	What happens with the average Muslims?
1764000	1768000	The average Muslims came in with or without sacrifice?
1768000	1771000	Generally without too much sacrifice.
1771000	1773000	But pretty soon in Medina,
1773000	1775000	after a little bit of time,
1775000	1778000	is there going to be a need for sacrifice?
1778000	1782000	Yeah, because Makkah is not sitting still.
1782000	1785000	The Makkahs are not happy about what happened.
1785000	1787000	And within six months,
1787000	1790000	there's going to be preparation for war.
1790000	1793000	Which means anybody who accepted Islam,
1793000	1796000	is potentially a member of the military.
1796000	1799000	I just like the prayers.
1799000	1800000	I thought it was really nice.
1800000	1802000	The Fatiha sounds so nice.
1802000	1807000	I just accepted Islam for so beautiful and spiritual.
1807000	1808000	What is this?
1808000	1809000	Fighting?
1809000	1810000	I don't know how to fight.
1810000	1812000	I'm a farmer.
1812000	1815000	I don't know how to fight.
1815000	1818000	The only fight I ever had was with my wife.
1818000	1820000	I don't know how to fight.
1820000	1821000	What do you mean?
1821000	1822000	We're going to bother?
1822000	1824000	We're going to bother?
1824000	1827000	And the people who came for political reasons,
1827000	1829000	remember the Munafiqoon?
1829000	1831000	They come to the regular Muslims and they say,
1831000	1833000	See what you signed up for?
1833000	1836000	You see what happens?
1836000	1839000	You miss the days of the past or what?
1839000	1843000	And the Munafiqoon are trying to pull the average Muslim
1843000	1845000	towards their team.
1845000	1848000	They also make them into what?
1848000	1849000	Munafiqoon.
1849000	1852000	So there's actually Munafiqoon in two categories.
1852000	1853000	They're two categories.
1853000	1857000	Now, again, let's understand this picture again.
1857000	1860000	Because there are three groups,
1860000	1864000	I want you to use the analogy of if you have a lot of iman,
1864000	1866000	it's high temperature.
1866000	1869000	If you are basically Muslim, middle temperature.
1869000	1871000	And if you have no iman,
1871000	1875000	or your hypocrite is cold temperature.
1875000	1880000	In Makkah, was the average temperature high, middle or low?
1880000	1882000	It was high.
1882000	1886000	But in Medina, is the overall temperature going down?
1886000	1888000	Yeah, so I'm not talking about one percent,
1888000	1890000	but overall as a community,
1890000	1895000	is the average iman, the overall iman, decreasing.
1895000	1897000	It is, isn't it?
1897000	1899000	To address this problem,
1899000	1902000	the overall iman is decreasing.
1902000	1906000	Muslims needed to be given a wake-up call.
1906000	1909000	Don't fall into being Munafiq.
1909000	1912000	Don't let your iman die.
1912000	1914000	You need to increase the temperature or not?
1914000	1916000	Decrease the temperature.
1916000	1921000	The goal of these ten surahs is to shake up the Muslims
1921000	1924000	to increase the temperature.
1924000	1926000	That's what's going on in these ten surahs.
1926000	1930000	Surat al-Jumu'ah is one of those ten surahs.
1930000	1931000	Okay?
1931000	1934000	And that's the overall picture.
1934000	1936000	I want you to understand the overall picture
1936000	1938000	and the agenda of these surahs, and that's what that is.
1938000	1939000	Is that clear to everybody?
1939000	1940000	Okay?
1940000	1942000	Now, let's go on.
1942000	1944000	I'll skip some of this.
1944000	1946000	Some things you should know.
1946000	1947000	These are some subtle things.
1947000	1949000	In the previous group,
1949000	1952000	let's see if anybody remembers which surah number to which surah number
1952000	1955000	was the previous group.
1955000	1958000	50 to 56.
1958000	1960000	This is Qaf to Waqya.
1960000	1962000	Allah talked in every surah,
1962000	1965000	He said something or the other about the Quran.
1965000	1967000	He said something in every one of them.
1967000	1970000	He started with Qaf and Quran in Majid.
1970000	1973000	Qaf, I swear by the Majestic Quran.
1973000	1975000	Wa dhakir bil Quranima ya khafu wa'id.
1975000	1978000	Remind with the Quran, whoever fears my threat.
1978000	1981000	Remind through the Quran, whoever fears my threat.
1981000	1983000	That's in surah Qaf number 50.
1983000	1985000	In 51, he says
1985000	1987000	fa warabbis sama'i wal ard innahu lahakun.
1987000	1989000	Or innahu lahakun,
1989000	1990000	mithlama annakum tantikun.
1990000	1992000	I swear by the master of the sky and the earth.
1992000	1994000	It is meaning the Quran is the truth,
1994000	1997000	as true as your ability to speak.
1997000	2000000	Though he's convincing people of the truth of the Quran.
2000000	2002000	Then he says
2002000	2006000	wa dhakir fa ma anta bina'umati rabbika bika'idin wa la majnun.
2006000	2008000	In 52, he says,
2008000	2011000	Remind people, because you are not a mind reader,
2011000	2013000	and you're not insane like they say.
2013000	2015000	Am yakuluna sha'irun.
2015000	2017000	Are they saying he's making poetry?
2017000	2018000	He's a poet.
2018000	2019000	Yat rabbasubihi raybal manun.
2019000	2021000	Let's see how the situation changes.
2021000	2023000	Maybe somebody will come and kill him.
2023000	2025000	Maybe his poetry will go out of fashion.
2025000	2027000	It won't be viral anymore.
2027000	2029000	Let's just see how things, let's wait and see.
2029000	2031000	Not that we'll just believe in him yet.
2031000	2032000	Let's wait and see.
2032000	2034000	Am yakuluna taqawwalahu.
2034000	2036000	Are they saying he just makes it up?
2036000	2038000	But that you quinoon know they're not ready to be convinced.
2038000	2041000	Fal yatubi hadithi mitnihi inkannu sadaqeen.
2041000	2043000	Let them bring something even close to it.
2043000	2045000	If they're telling the truth.
2045000	2048000	What is that a challenge of? Produce something like what?
2048000	2050000	Here's all the allegations.
2050000	2051000	This is what you think the Quran is.
2051000	2055000	Okay, well, if it's poetry, give me your poetry.
2055000	2058000	If it's magic, show me some magic.
2058000	2060000	In Surah number 53, he says
2060000	2061000	wa ma antaqawwalahu.
2061000	2064000	He's not making this up from his own feelings.
2064000	2067000	He doesn't speak from his own feelings, his own emotions.
2067000	2068000	In huwa illa wahyunuha.
2068000	2071000	This is nothing but revelation that's being given to him.
2071000	2075000	In Surah, the Deqsura after Qamar, or after Najam Qamar,
2075000	2076000	Allah says,
2076000	2079000	wa laqad yassarna al-Quran al-dhikri fa hal minwooddhikir.
2079000	2082000	We made the Quran easy for people to get reminder.
2082000	2085000	We made it easy for them to remember Allah.
2085000	2088000	Then is there anyone who wants to benefit from that reminder?
2088000	2091000	You know the famous words about the Quran in Surah Al-Rahman already.
2091000	2093000	Surah number 55,
2093000	2096000	al-Rahmanu al-Rahman.
2096000	2099000	The most loving, the most caring one.
2099000	2101000	He's the one who taught the Quran.
2101000	2104000	Why do you not realize this is an act of love from Allah?
2104000	2108000	And then, at the very end of this, in Surah number 56,
2108000	2110000	really interesting,
2110000	2114000	fa la'uqusimu bimawaqi an-nujum wa inna hulaqasamu allahu ta'alahu na'adhim,
2114000	2116000	inna hulaquranu al-karim.
2116000	2121000	I swear by how the stars are placed in the galaxies.
2121000	2123000	And that is an amazing oath.
2123000	2125000	This is a noble Quran.
2125000	2126000	This Quran.
2126000	2130000	Allah compares the Quran's ayat to the stars in the galaxies.
2130000	2133000	Which is a deep discussion, but for another time.
2133000	2135000	I've already done the series on ad-waqya.
2135000	2137000	But I will tell you this much.
2137000	2140000	Allah says about the Quran in Surah Al-Baqya,
2140000	2142000	the last Surah before this group begins.
2142000	2144000	He says something special.
2144000	2145000	He says,
2145000	2147000	afa bihaathal hadithi an-tumbudheanoon.
2147000	2152000	You want to play games and negotiate with this book,
2152000	2154000	with this speech?
2154000	2155000	You want to do a negotiation?
2155000	2157000	We like this part, we don't like this part.
2157000	2159000	This is what you want to do.
2159000	2162000	wa ta-jaaluna risqakum annaqum duqadzeeboon.
2162000	2167000	And you think that you can just keep your provisions, your rizq.
2167000	2171000	Meaning, the real reason you want to play games with the Quran,
2171000	2175000	with this revelation, is because you don't want to lose out on your money,
2175000	2178000	or your assets, or your social power.
2178000	2183000	So you want to take the parts of the Quran that allow you to keep your current assets
2183000	2188000	and your business, and your politics, and your social standing, exactly how it is.
2188000	2191000	And everything that challenges that, you want to put that aside.
2191000	2193000	That's the negotiation you want to do.
2193000	2198000	This was important because in the coming Surahs, the group we're dealing with,
2198000	2201000	Allah will talk a lot about the hypocrites.
2201000	2202000	Now you understand why?
2202000	2204000	And what do the hypocrites want to do?
2204000	2206000	They want to compromise the word of Allah.
2206000	2209000	They want to protect their assets.
2209000	2211000	They want to protect their political standing.
2211000	2217000	By the end of the last group, we were already mentally prepared for what's coming in this group.
2217000	2222000	Something special that happens in this group, moving from the previous group,
2222000	2226000	is Allah doesn't just talk about the Quran, which He will, in practically every Surah.
2226000	2230000	He'll also mention something about the Quran from 57 to 66.
2230000	2231000	But He'll add something.
2231000	2236000	This time it's going to be about loyalty to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
2236000	2239000	This is actually going to, the Prophet's going to keep coming up.
2239000	2240000	He'll treat the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
2240000	2245000	And what the Prophet does for you, like in 57, he says Allah sent His ayat,
2245000	2249000	His revelations to His slave, meaning the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam,
2249000	2252000	so he can bring you out of darknesses into light.
2252000	2255000	Allah didn't just mention the Quran, He mentioned the Prophet, His slave.
2255000	2257000	He highlights him.
2257000	2262000	Then He will keep mentioning, oh, believe in His Messenger and believe in His book.
2262000	2263000	You know?
2263000	2272000	And He'll allow you to walk in light.
2272000	2276000	So that now, it's not just in the previous group, it was a focus on the Quran.
2276000	2281000	And now there's a focus on the Quran and the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
2281000	2284000	This is really important, especially for Medina.
2284000	2285000	Why?
2285000	2288000	Because people say, yeah, of course I believe in God.
2288000	2290000	I believe in the afterlife.
2290000	2292000	Yeah.
2292000	2294000	Oh, why do I have to go to war?
2294000	2297000	Just because He's saying it?
2297000	2300000	I mean, He's just another man like us.
2300000	2305000	Okay, fine, He's a Prophet, but we don't have to follow Him in everything.
2305000	2307000	I mean, these guys are crazy.
2307000	2308000	Look at these people.
2308000	2310000	They became homeless following Him.
2310000	2317000	They're living here on welfare in Medina, even though they had homes and families in Makkah.
2317000	2319000	These people are idiots.
2319000	2321000	You want me to be like these idiots?
2321000	2323000	Anubinu kama amanasufaha.
2323000	2326000	We should believe like these idiots believe.
2326000	2327000	It's in the Quran.
2327000	2329000	That's what they said.
2329000	2334000	In other words, their loyalty to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, made them bankrupt.
2334000	2337000	Their loyalty ruined their life.
2337000	2339000	So they're trying to question.
2339000	2341000	You should follow the Prophet.
2341000	2342000	Pray with Him.
2342000	2343000	That's fine.
2343000	2345000	Listen to some inspirational speeches.
2345000	2346000	That's good.
2346000	2350000	But if He's asking you for bigger sacrifices, come on.
2350000	2351000	We're not crazy.
2351000	2353000	That's too much.
2353000	2354000	That's too extreme.
2354000	2356000	We're not going to take that route.
2356000	2357000	You understand?
2357000	2363000	So now it was important to highlight loyalty to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, in these surahs.
2363000	2369000	Okay, now, actually, I want to skip this part.
2369000	2370000	I want to show you this diagram.
2370000	2376000	I don't know if it's going to make any sense to you, but I'm going to try.
2376000	2379000	So on the left side, it says, this bih.
2379000	2381000	You guys know what this bih has?
2381000	2383000	Anyone know what this bih has?
2383000	2384000	Saying Subhanallah.
2384000	2385000	What does Subhanallah mean?
2385000	2390000	We'll have a discussion today about it, but after this introduction today, the only thing we will get done is
2390000	2392000	ayah number one, hopefully.
2392000	2393000	Hopefully.
2393000	2396000	Okay, so that's as far as we can go today.
2396000	2402000	But anyway, this bih means to declare Allah as perfect.
2402000	2409000	So when you say Subhanallah, you are saying, I declare that Allah is perfect or Allah is flawless.
2409000	2410000	Flawless.
2410000	2418000	When you say something about Allah or you believe about Allah, that anything that would take away from His perfection,
2418000	2421000	you have removed it from your mind.
2421000	2423000	That would be the bih.
2423000	2428000	Okay, so in a sense, you can say, you know what detox is?
2428000	2429000	Right?
2429000	2434000	You detox your concept of God from any impurities.
2434000	2436000	That's called this bih.
2436000	2439000	That's actually, so removing all the negative.
2439000	2441000	Removing all the negative.
2441000	2443000	That's this bih.
2443000	2445000	Hound is something else.
2445000	2448000	Hound is adding all the positive.
2448000	2454000	This bih removes all the negative and Hound adds all the positive.
2454000	2456000	That's the two sides of it.
2456000	2460000	You cannot add Hound without first doing what?
2460000	2461000	Tasbih.
2461000	2463000	You're gonna do Tasbih first.
2463000	2470000	But you can't just do Tasbih because just because you say Allah is perfect, He doesn't have any flaws.
2470000	2472000	You still haven't said anything good about Him.
2472000	2474000	You just didn't say anything bad about Him.
2474000	2476000	That's not good enough.
2476000	2479000	So there's Subhanallah, but there's also what?
2479000	2481000	Alhamdulillah, they go together.
2481000	2482000	Al-Ad-Dukr'an.
2482000	2485000	Fasabbih bih-Hamdi Rabbika.
2485000	2489000	Meaning do Tasbih with the Hound of your Rabb.
2489000	2496000	Meaning first remove all the negative, detox your concepts of God to make them pure, and then add the positive.
2496000	2497000	You understand?
2497000	2505000	These surahs, the ones that are marked in green, meaning 57 Hadid, 59 Hasher, 61 Mumtahana, 62,
2505000	2509000	or Saf, sorry 61 Saf, 62 Jumu'an, 64 Ta'abun.
2509000	2513000	These are the ones that begin with Tasbih.
2513000	2517000	So half of them begin with Tasbih.
2517000	2519000	That's an important observation.
2519000	2522000	Tasbih is one of the main themes in this group.
2522000	2524000	So half of them get it.
2524000	2530000	Another thing that keeps coming up in these surahs is in fact spending.
2530000	2534000	Spending keeps coming up one way or the other.
2534000	2541000	In 57, 58, 59, skip 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65.
2541000	2544000	Spending, spending, spending, spending, spending.
2544000	2546000	The last one is interesting.
2546000	2552000	In 65, it's actually spending on in family matters.
2552000	2555000	Spending not related to battle, but in family matters.
2555000	2558000	Hypocrisy, which I mentioned to you is the problem.
2558000	2559000	Where does it come up?
2559000	2560000	How does it come up?
2560000	2562000	Where does it come up?
2562000	2563000	Every one of them.
2563000	2564000	Every one of them.
2564000	2567000	And then the last ones, I changed the color a little bit.
2567000	2573000	Not because I ran out of ink, but because it is being talked about more indirectly.
2573000	2577000	It's there, but not as direct as the other surahs.
2577000	2581000	Then of course, this is really interesting.
2581000	2584000	Two things that seem like they have nothing to do with each other.
2584000	2585000	What are the last two items?
2585000	2587000	Family and what?
2587000	2589000	Prophetic war.
2589000	2594000	You would think, okay, what the prophet moved to Medina, so now there's the Quraysh
2594000	2596000	that are going to attack.
2596000	2599000	There's going to be wars, but that is going to happen.
2599000	2600000	Uhud is going to happen.
2600000	2604000	These are the battles and the life of the prophet and many small battles in between.
2604000	2605000	So there's war matters.
2605000	2608000	And of course, when you talk about war, there's a goal.
2608000	2611000	Once we win, we will establish government.
2611000	2614000	And when we establish government, these will be the laws.
2614000	2617000	This is how we will deal with murderers.
2617000	2618000	This is how we will deal with thieves.
2618000	2622000	This is how we will deal with criminals, war criminals.
2622000	2624000	This is how we will establish justice.
2624000	2627000	Like there's these big constitutional laws.
2627000	2633000	You would think you would talk about those, but what the Qur'an does is he talks in these surahs about prophetic war.
2633000	2641000	And then instead of talking about the constitutions that will come after winning the prophetic war, he talks about family law.
2641000	2645000	He talks about a lot about husband and wife, actually.
2645000	2651000	Husband and wife is like surat al-Mujadala, all about husband and wife, all over it.
2651000	2659000	Surat al-Taghabun, actually even before that, in surat al-Mumtahana, is about husband and wife.
2659000	2663000	And then you get surat al-Munafiqun.
2663000	2664000	And then he says,
2664000	2668000	Don't you have money, you don't have children, you don't have children, that's about children and money.
2668000	2671000	Don't let them distract you from Allah's remembrance.
2671000	2672000	In 64 he says,
2672000	2675000	Your money and your spouses are a great test for you.
2675000	2678000	Some people don't read a little too much right now.
2678000	2679000	The moment I said,
2679000	2682000	Your money and your spouses are a great test for you.
2684000	2685000	Yeah.
2686000	2688000	Haqq, the Qur'an is Haqq.
2693000	2698000	Surat number 65 is called at-Talaq, the surah of divorce.
2698000	2705000	Surat al-Tahreem is a surah that begins and ends with actually the spousal relationship,
2705000	2707000	guidance on the spousal relation.
2707000	2708000	And in the middle it says,
2708000	2712000	Qohan fusakum ahli kumnaara, save yourselves and your families from the fire.
2712000	2715000	The thing is, I said there seems to be a contrast.
2715000	2720000	Why would war be mentioned side by side with what?
2720000	2724000	Family law, family guidance, married life.
2724000	2726000	What is the connection between these two things?
2726000	2731000	This is actually where you appreciate the philosophy of the Qur'an, the wisdom of the Qur'an.
2731000	2735000	Allah sent Adam, alayhi salam, to this earth.
2735000	2739000	And there was three that came down to the earth together.
2739000	2742000	Adam, Hawa and there was one more.
2744000	2746000	Iblis, thank you very much.
2746000	2747000	Alakoum.
2749000	2750000	Iblis.
2750000	2751000	And Allah says,
2751000	2752000	Allah says,
2753000	2755000	You will be enemies to each other.
2755000	2757000	He said, you will be enemies to each other.
2757000	2760000	So there's three people, three individuals.
2760000	2763000	Adam, Hawa and Iblis.
2763000	2765000	And Allah says, you'll be enemies to each other.
2765000	2766000	What does that mean?
2766000	2768000	You too will be enemy of that one?
2768000	2769000	No, that's not what that means.
2769000	2772000	If I say to three people, you will all be enemies to each other.
2772000	2774000	A will be enemy of B.
2774000	2777000	A will also be enemy of C.
2777000	2779000	B will be enemy of A and C.
2779000	2781000	C of A and B, you understand?
2781000	2782000	It's going to go.
2782000	2787000	So, shaitan's job is to make sure that you become an enemy with who?
2788000	2790000	The man becomes an enemy too.
2791000	2793000	And then they become enemies of their children.
2793000	2795000	And their children become enemies of each other.
2795000	2797000	And animosity spreads.
2798000	2801000	That's the whole, it started with man and wife.
2801000	2806000	Allah is saying in the Qur'an, you solve that conflict.
2807000	2809000	You address that conflict.
2809000	2812000	And you've created peace inside of a family.
2813000	2815000	If you've created peace inside of a family,
2815000	2817000	you're going to raise children in what?
2817000	2818000	Peace.
2819000	2822000	And those children, because they have learned peace,
2822000	2825000	will then create families that also have what?
2825000	2826000	Peace.
2826000	2828000	Peace will become viral.
2828000	2831000	But if you have conflict here,
2831000	2835000	then what will you pass down to coming generations?
2835000	2836000	Conflict.
2837000	2838000	You'll pass conflict down.
2838000	2839000	Conflict, conflict.
2839000	2841000	And you will be enemies to each other.
2841000	2845000	Now, the Rasul S.A.W. is going to war for the sake of Allah.
2845000	2847000	And as if Allah is saying,
2847000	2851000	if you don't win the battleground of the family,
2851000	2854000	then there's no purpose of this war.
2854000	2857000	The real victory, the real palace is actually,
2857000	2860000	the Book of Allah is implemented in the household.
2860000	2863000	Now, I'll tell you something that you might think is shocking.
2863000	2865000	It's actually quite true.
2865000	2869000	If you think of all the laws that are mentioned in Islam,
2869000	2871000	and the Quran,
2871000	2873000	the Quran is a book of proportions, by the way.
2873000	2875000	Everything is in proportion.
2875000	2877000	Like Allah created my body in proportion.
2877000	2878000	My fingers are a certain size.
2878000	2880000	My legs are a certain size.
2880000	2882000	My pinky is not the size of my leg.
2882000	2883000	Alhamdulillah.
2883000	2884000	Right?
2884000	2885000	Everything is in proportion.
2885000	2886000	Something is small.
2886000	2887000	Something is big.
2887000	2888000	Isn't that the case?
2888000	2889000	Some bones are small.
2889000	2890000	Some bones are big.
2890000	2892000	Some nerves are longer.
2892000	2893000	Some nerves are shorter.
2893000	2894000	Isn't that the case?
2894000	2897000	The Quran, some subjects take up more space.
2897000	2899000	Some subjects take less space.
2899000	2901000	Isn't that the case?
2901000	2903000	And Allah decided all of it.
2903000	2905000	This is a design from Allah Himself.
2905000	2909000	It is designed, the vast majority of the laws mentioned in the Quran
2909000	2911000	are family laws.
2911000	2913000	The vast majority.
2913000	2917000	You would have number two, maybe financial laws.
2917000	2921000	Those two take the main stage.
2921000	2923000	Main space in the Quran.
2923000	2927000	And within them, the marital relationship and inheritance,
2927000	2929000	top items.
2929000	2931000	They're top, top items.
2931000	2936000	When we don't know the Quran, and we don't study the Quran,
2936000	2939000	we have a different picture of where the focus is.
2939000	2940000	You understand?
2940000	2944000	When you actually look and study what Allah is saying,
2944000	2947000	and how He's saying it, and where He's placing it.
2947000	2951000	One of the most amazing surahs in this series is Surah number 66.
2951000	2953000	I'll just tell you one thing about it because we got to keep moving.
2953000	2956000	Surah number 66, Surah Tuttahrim.
2956000	2962000	It begins with the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
2962000	2972000	being too influenced by some of his wives who were trying to be controlling.
2972000	2974000	They were trying to be controlling over him.
2974000	2978000	Everybody has a right over everybody, but they were trying to make him
2978000	2981000	make something Qalam that Allah didn't make Qalam.
2981000	2983000	And then you kind of like, I'll make it easy for you.
2983000	2987000	If you love me, you won't go hang out with your friends ever again.
2987000	2989000	Or if you love me.
2989000	2992000	Or if you love me, you'll never get your sister,
2992000	2996000	and you'll never call your sister because you love me.
2996000	3001000	Well, I mean, I love you a little less now.
3002000	3004000	Because I still love my sister.
3004000	3006000	Husbands can do this, wives can do this.
3006000	3009000	You try to make a condition out of love of me.
3009000	3012000	You need to cut off a part of yourself.
3012000	3015000	You need to cut out some people from your life.
3015000	3019000	You can't, you know, young men or young women, they love doing something.
3019000	3020000	They love art.
3020000	3023000	Or they love some guy, love basketball.
3023000	3028000	That is why he says, yeah, okay, no, no, go play basketball, go, go, go.
3028000	3030000	Well, why would you stay home?
3030000	3032000	I go once a year.
3032000	3033000	No, no, go, go.
3033000	3035000	It's okay.
3036000	3038000	I'm fine.
3041000	3044000	What she, she's not, she's saying go, but she's not saying go.
3044000	3047000	She's saying, if you really loved me, you'd give that up.
3047000	3049000	You wouldn't go.
3049000	3050000	You understand?
3050000	3053000	So what happens over time, you build a resentment.
3053000	3056000	If this person doesn't let me be who I am.
3056000	3057000	They're controlling.
3057000	3058000	They're controlling.
3058000	3062000	They're using my love for them as a chain to stop me.
3062000	3064000	I'm not even doing something wrong.
3064000	3067000	I just wanted to say salam.
3067000	3069000	I just wanted to go see a friend.
3069000	3074000	I just wanted to say some people don't, you know, some, some mothers will tell their sons,
3074000	3079000	if you love me, you will do, you will do this, this, this to your wife,
3079000	3082000	or you will say this, this, this to your wife, or you won't talk to her,
3082000	3085000	or you won't do, you'll punish her in this way.
3085000	3088000	Mom, go eat a sandwich.
3088000	3091000	This is, this not your space.
3091000	3093000	Yes, Snickers.
3093000	3094000	That'll be good.
3094000	3095000	Yeah.
3095000	3102000	The point is, in the beginning, the Prophet was told, don't allow a family member to go beyond their rights,
3102000	3104000	to step on your own rights.
3104000	3105000	Don't do that.
3105000	3108000	Cause if you do that, then your entire Oma will learn that from you.
3108000	3110000	And that will become okay.
3110000	3111000	You are role model.
3111000	3114000	So, Allah, you said, this is in the beginning of what's your role?
3115000	3119000	At the end of the Surah, Allah says,
3124000	3130000	Prophet, make jihad against the Kuffar, and make jihad against the hypocrites.
3130000	3135000	Whoa, now he's being talked to like he's the commander in chief,
3135000	3138000	the general of the Muslim military, you understand?
3139000	3142000	And fight those who are trying to create espionage,
3142000	3147000	and trying to be traitors from inside, the spies within you, fight them,
3147000	3149000	and fight the enemy outside.
3149000	3152000	So the commander in chief is being talked to as the general,
3152000	3155000	and he's being told lead the war, isn't he?
3155000	3159000	But is that at the beginning of the Surah at the end?
3159000	3161000	At the end?
3161000	3164000	You would think, between a family issue,
3164000	3167000	and war,
3167000	3169000	war for the sake of Allah,
3169000	3171000	what should be in our mind?
3171000	3173000	What is item number one in our head?
3173000	3174000	War.
3174000	3176000	Jihad is a bit of law.
3176000	3179000	And it's all the way down at the end.
3179000	3180000	Why?
3180000	3182000	Because that's the first battle.
3182000	3184000	That's the priority.
3184000	3186000	That's how humanity was sent down.
3186000	3189000	There's a mindset that's taught in the Zayat.
3189000	3192000	You know, the Quran is not just information, it's a mindset.
3192000	3193000	What is priority?
3193000	3195000	Why are you even fighting?
3195000	3197000	What's even the purpose?
3197000	3199000	What's even the purpose?
3199000	3203000	You know, in Surat Muhammad, Surat Muhammad is a surah of fighting.
3203000	3207000	It's a surah, it's also called Surat Al-Qita, the surah of fighting.
3207000	3208000	It says,
3208000	3212000	Allah says,
3212000	3214000	if you don't fight, you know what's going to happen?
3214000	3216000	You will cause corruption in the land,
3216000	3219000	and you will cut family ties.
3219000	3220000	Allah says,
3220000	3224000	the great tragedy of not fighting against the Mushrikun
3224000	3226000	in Makkah, the prophetic war.
3226000	3228000	You know what the real damage of that will be?
3228000	3230000	Family ties will be cut.
3230000	3231000	That's what Quran says.
3231000	3233000	Remarkable.
3233000	3236000	The thing, the reason I'm making a point to share this with you is,
3236000	3239000	oftentimes we are afraid to talk about why the Prophet fought.
3239000	3241000	What was he fighting for?
3241000	3245000	And what's even scarier is when people do talk about the subject,
3245000	3247000	they don't talk about this.
3247000	3250000	Which is right there in the book staring at you.
3250000	3255000	It's important to highlight what Quran, let the Quran speak for itself.
3255000	3258000	So this is the neighborhood in which Surat Al-Jumu'a belongs.
3258000	3263000	Now just a couple other quick, really subtle and beautiful points.
3263000	3266000	The Tasbih of Allah.
3266000	3269000	Let me tell you a phrase so you understand what this all means.
3269000	3271000	I'll explain it first.
3271000	3275000	Sabbahalillahi ma'fi al-samawati wal-arth.
3275000	3278000	Sabbahalillahi ma'fi al-samawati wal-ma'fi al-arth.
3278000	3282000	Everything, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth,
3282000	3285000	has always done Tasbih of Allah.
3285000	3287000	Hear me again in English.
3287000	3291000	Everything that's in the skies, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth,
3291000	3294000	has always done Tasbih of Allah.
3294000	3297000	I used has always done.
3297000	3299000	Yes? Let me use it again.
3299000	3302000	Everything, whatever is in the skies, whatever is in the earth,
3302000	3307000	does and will always do Tasbih of Allah.
3307000	3309000	What tense did I use now?
3309000	3312000	The present and future.
3312000	3318000	Some of these surahs mentioned the Tasbih of Allah in the past.
3318000	3321000	So you find that in Surat Al-Hadeed.
3321000	3325000	In the beginning of Surat Al-Hadeed, you find that in Surat Al-Hashal,
3325000	3327000	you find that in Surat Al-Jumu'a.
3327000	3331000	Not Jumu'a, sorry, a Saf.
3331000	3336000	And there are three surahs in which the Tasbih has mentioned in the present and the future.
3336000	3342000	Everything in the skies and the earth does and will continue to do the Tasbih of Allah.
3342000	3349000	That's mentioned in Surat Al-Hashal and in Jumu'a and in Taha'bun.
3349000	3352000	One surah has both past and present. Which one?
3352000	3356000	Which number do you see past and present together?
3356000	3360000	Hashr. Hashr opens with the past, ends with the present.
3360000	3364000	Okay? But I'm not teaching you Surat Al-Hashr, so I won't tell you why that happens.
3364000	3369000	It's pretty cool though. I will tell you something else.
3369000	3376000	Every time Allah mentions Tasbih in the past, he mentions fighting.
3376000	3382000	The surahs that begin with Tasbih in the past, they mention prophetic war.
3382000	3387000	The surahs that mentioned Tasbih in the future, they don't mention what?
3387000	3391000	Prophetic war. And actually, there's lots to learn here,
3391000	3396000	but one subtle thing I will tell you, the war that was administered to the Prophet,
3396000	3400000	will become a thing of the past.
3400000	3403000	This will be a historic war that will bring the victory of Islam
3403000	3410000	and cleanse the house of Allah that was built by Ibrahim, and it's actually meant to become a thing of the past.
3410000	3414000	And then Tasbih of Allah forever shall continue.
3414000	3419000	So there's an association of the past with war actually in these surahs,
3419000	3422000	with prophetic war particularly.
3422000	3426000	But then there's another really beautiful thing, and that's not happening in this surah,
3426000	3431000	but you should note the perfection of the Quran. Listen to me carefully and tell me the difference.
3431000	3438000	Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth,
3438000	3443000	declares the perfection of Allah. How many times did you hear whatever?
3443000	3448000	Good. I'll say it again. Whatever is in the skies and the earth declares the perfection of Allah.
3448000	3452000	How many times did you hear whatever?
3452000	3458000	There's only two places where Allah says whatever once.
3458000	3460000	Whatever is in the skies and the earth.
3460000	3464000	Everywhere else, He says whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth.
3464000	3466000	He mentions ma twice.
3466000	3469000	Subh'Allah, ma fis-sama'u wa tih, wa ma fil-ardhi, ma is twice.
3469000	3470000	Other places,
3470000	3474000	Subh'Allah, ma fis-sama'u wa tih, wa ad-dhi, just once.
3474000	3476000	Now if I told you,
3476000	3482000	I know whatever you said and whatever you said and whatever you said,
3482000	3486000	and I say, I know whatever you said, you and you and you said,
3486000	3489000	which one is more namble?
3489000	3493000	The second one is more namble. You don't have to say whatever over and again.
3493000	3494000	Why are you doing that?
3494000	3499000	Because I'm going to come after you, then I'm going to come after you, then I'm going to come after you.
3499000	3503000	There's extra emphasis on every whatever, you understand?
3503000	3509000	So when Allah says, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth,
3509000	3514000	declares the perfection of Allah, is there a special stress on the earth?
3514000	3516000	You understand?
3516000	3519000	So you'll find in most of these surahs, wherever Tasbih has mentioned,
3519000	3522000	there's a special stress on the earth.
3522000	3526000	And what's really cool is Allah will mention that special stress on the earth,
3526000	3530000	and immediately in the next ayah, something about the peep us,
3530000	3534000	whatever is happening in the earth will be mentioned, immediately after.
3534000	3539000	There's only two places where that special whatever is on the earth is not mentioned,
3539000	3540000	two places.
3540000	3544000	Those two places are Surat al-Hadeed at the beginning,
3544000	3546000	and Surat al-Hashr at the end.
3546000	3549000	You sabbi'u lahumaf is samawati wal-arduwa wal-aziz al-hakim.
3549000	3555000	What's amazing about those two places is they only talk about Allah.
3555000	3558000	There's no mention of what's going on in the world.
3558000	3561000	At the end of Surat al-Hashr, you find
3588000	3593000	the earth, no special emphasis on the earth this time,
3593000	3599000	because it was all about Allah, and there was no focus on the people of the earth at the end.
3599000	3600000	It's only about Allah.
3600000	3603000	Go to the beginning of Surat, and if you don't know the Arabic,
3603000	3606000	these were all names of Allah, descriptions of Allah.
3606000	3608000	Now you go to the beginning of Surat al-Hadeed.
3618000	3623000	Allah is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six days,
3623000	3624000	then He created the earth.
3624000	3627000	He knows what is going on in the earth and what is coming out of it,
3627000	3629000	and what is coming out of the heavens and what is going on in it.
3629000	3631000	He is with you wherever you are.
3631000	3633000	And Allah is the One Who makes us see.
3633000	3635000	He is the One Who has the heavens and the earth.
3635000	3638000	And if Allah makes things happen again, He will make the night in the fire,
3638000	3640000	and He will make the night in the night.
3640000	3642000	And He is the One Who knows the same things.
3642000	3644000	Allah is the One Who makes things happen.
3644000	3646000	All of it is about Him.
3646000	3649000	So Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah.
3649000	3651000	There is no focus in the world.
3651000	3655000	Now just be, forget about worldly matters in this passage.
3655000	3657000	The two places that talk about Allah uniquely,
3657000	3658000	the Ma is removed.
3658000	3661000	This is just to show you every small detail in the Quran,
3661000	3665000	every word in the Quran has a strategic location and a placement.
3665000	3668000	Right? But the one we are dealing with, is there a Ma?
3668000	3671000	You sabbi'u lillahi maafi's samawati.
3671000	3675000	Maafi lillahi, surat al-jamu'a, there is two Ma's.
3675000	3679000	Now, I know my introduction is going to take super long,
3679000	3681000	but should I give you a break now?
3681000	3684000	I don't really care about your feelings.
3684000	3687000	Surat al-Suf is the surah right before this one.
3687000	3692000	In my study of the Quran, it's important to know what neighborhood a surah belongs to, remember?
3692000	3696000	And one of the, so one is what group does it belong to?
3696000	3700000	And the other, the other is, who's the immediate neighbor?
3700000	3703000	What's the surah right before and what's the surah right after?
3703000	3707000	So the surah right before, the surah we're about to study, is surat al-Suf.
3707000	3708000	Surat al-Suf.
3708000	3712000	So the surah begins with, everything has declared the perfection of Allah,
3712000	3713000	sabbaha, the past tense.
3713000	3720000	This surah is going to begin, every surah declares and will continue to declare the perfection of Allah.
3720000	3724000	Between the past, present and future, doesn't that cover all time?
3724000	3729000	So they already complement each other because it kind of together, they cover all time.
3729000	3736000	And the this was happening since ever and is happening now and will continue to happen forever.
3736000	3738000	So all three tenses get covered.
3738000	3744000	In this, in the last surah Allah mentions, what did he send the messenger with?
3744000	3746000	He sent him with guidance.
3746000	3748000	What did he send in with?
3748000	3753000	In this surah we're going to learn, who was he sent to?
3753000	3756000	Who was he sent to?
3757000	3761000	There we're going to learn, what was his overall objective?
3761000	3766000	He can make this deen victorious.
3766000	3769000	Here, that's the overall of the macro objective.
3769000	3771000	You understand macro and micro?
3771000	3772000	That's the macro objective.
3772000	3774000	What's the micro objective?
3774000	3777000	Every individual needs to be purified.
3777000	3779000	Every individual needs to be transformed.
3779000	3781000	That's going to be in this surah.
3781000	3785000	You find in just two reactions.
3785000	3788000	Especially in Makkah, there were two reactions to the Prophet.
3788000	3793000	Some people, they were all mushrikun before, they were all mushrikun.
3793000	3797000	Some of them, when the Quran came, they hated the Prophet a lot.
3797000	3802000	And some of them, when the Quran came, they left their misguidance and accepted Islam.
3802000	3806000	The people who hated the Prophet are mentioned in surah As-Saf,
3806000	3808000	wa laukariha al-mushrikun.
3808000	3811000	And the people who came towards Islam and left their shirk,
3811000	3815000	wa inkaanu min qabdu lafiql al-alim mubin are mentioned in this surah.
3815000	3819000	In surah As-Saf, Allah mentioned Musa spoke to his people.
3819000	3821000	Who were his people?
3821000	3822000	Good, Bani Israel.
3822000	3825000	Isa spoke to Bani Israel.
3825000	3829000	And they both were speaking to people who already believed.
3829000	3833000	They were already Muslim, but they weren't living up to Islam.
3833000	3835000	Even though they had a Prophet among them.
3835000	3838000	And both of these prophets came to which nation?
3838000	3839000	Bani Israel.
3839000	3843000	In this surah, you're going to find the example of those who were given the Torah
3843000	3847000	as a responsibility and they did not carry this responsibility.
3847000	3849000	Do you see a continuity?
3849000	3852000	Musa is the beginning of the Torah.
3852000	3854000	Isa is the conclusion of the Torah.
3854000	3857000	And now, alladina hummilu tawrat in the next surah.
3857000	3863000	So you see, you can see there's a continuity of messaging from one surah to the next surah.
3863000	3866000	Allah mentions there, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
3866000	3868000	Allahul-Ayyah delqawwal fasiteen.
3868000	3870000	Allahul-Ayyah delqawwal lalimeen.
3870000	3872000	This is mentioned two times in surah As-Saf.
3872000	3874000	And in this surah, you'll also find,
3874000	3876000	Allahul-Ayyah delqawwal lalimeen.
3876000	3880000	Allah does not guide misguide or does not guide the wrongdoing people.
3880000	3886000	One of the most amazing contrasts in surah As-Saf, when Allah was encouraging the Muslims
3886000	3889000	to engage in prophetic war when the war was coming towards them,
3889000	3890000	He says,
3890000	3891000	He says,
3894000	3897000	Should I tell you of a business deal that will save you?
3897000	3900000	Should I tell you of a business deal that will what?
3900000	3901000	Save you.
3901000	3903000	And Allah mentions tijara again in this surah.
3903000	3906000	He says, when the Prophet, peace be upon him, was standing giving khudba,
3906000	3910000	there was some trade show going on, some caravan.
3910000	3915000	You know, nowadays you can buy, you know, clothes and groceries and things like that.
3915000	3918000	You can buy them from the mall or from the grocery store.
3918000	3920000	And the day they didn't have grocery stores like that,
3920000	3926000	people used to bring the items and stop and then they set up a whole camp for your shopping,
3926000	3929000	like a fair, like a market, right?
3929000	3931000	Set up a market and then briefly they're there.
3931000	3935000	If you want to catch the best deals, come early and then get out.
3935000	3941000	So the Jumar of khudba was going on, Salat al Jumar was going on and this trade fair came.
3941000	3947000	And people heard the bells and the, you know, the dancers and the singing songs and all that stuff
3947000	3952000	that they set up to make noise, to attract their customers and a bunch of people left Salat al Jumar
3952000	3954000	and went there.
3954000	3959000	Now the good thing nowadays is you don't have to leave the masjid to go to the entertainment.
3959000	3964000	You could just, you don't have to get up.
3964000	3965000	It comes to you.
3965000	3966000	You don't have to go to it.
3966000	3968000	But anyway, Allah says,
3968000	3970000	When they saw that trade,
3970000	3974000	they saw something entertaining, they ran towards it.
3974000	3976000	They left you standing there.
3976000	3983000	Allah mentions you will fight in the last path and you will spend with your money and your own selves.
3983000	3985000	You'll spend your own life.
3985000	3987000	That would be the ultimate trade.
3987000	3994000	And in this Surah, Allah will say that the death that you are running away from, it will catch you.
3994000	3996000	There's no way that you'll escape.
3996000	3997000	In the Mouta,
3997000	3998000	LaDhi Taferruna Minhu.
3998000	4005000	One of my most interesting, most favorite comparisons of these two Surahs is actually about Jesus.
4006000	4011000	So if you don't know, the followers of Jesus are called the Hawariyun.
4011000	4013000	The Bible calls them the disciples.
4013000	4015000	The disciples of Jesus.
4015000	4017000	They weren't many.
4017000	4019000	They were very few.
4019000	4024000	And after whatever happened in his mission, they were all spread out.
4024000	4027000	Like, they didn't win the battle.
4027000	4028000	You understand?
4028000	4030000	They were dispersed because they were so few.
4031000	4042000	And it took a couple of centuries before the Christianity or the some version of following Jesus made a comeback.
4042000	4047000	But for a long time, it was just dispersed in the early mission of Jesus.
4047000	4057000	By contrast, in this Surah, Allah says that Allah sent this messenger among people that had no education before, the Arabs.
4058000	4064000	And there are others who haven't joined them yet, who are coming.
4064000	4066000	Who's he talking about?
4066000	4068000	Others who haven't joined them yet.
4068000	4070000	Hey, he's talking about us.
4070000	4072000	He's talking about us.
4072000	4081000	He's talking about Islam going to Europe, Islam going to Africa, Islam going to Asia, Islam reaching Australia, Islam going everywhere.
4081000	4083000	It's going to go everywhere.
4083000	4085000	And the numbers are going to what?
4085000	4090000	And is it going to be many centuries of Islam disappearing and then it will appear?
4090000	4091000	No, no, no.
4091000	4094000	From the very beginning, Islam keeps spreading and spreading it.
4094000	4096000	This is the Fadl of Allah.
4096000	4097000	That's the favor of Allah.
4097000	4099000	He gives it to whoever he wants.
4099000	4102000	That is not how things played out in the mission of Jesus.
4102000	4105000	But this is how things are going to happen in the mission of Muhammad.
4105000	4111000	So, Allah, you guys seen, I mean, don't answer this publicly isn't people might stare at you.
4111000	4114000	You guys seen the Hollywood side in LA on the mountain?
4115000	4117000	Yeah, it's okay.
4119000	4124000	I was in an island in Malaysia, Kotakina, Peru, some time ago.
4124000	4136000	And this is like, you fly out of Kuala Lumpur a couple of hours, you're going over the ocean and you landed this remote island.
4136000	4138000	It's like a vacation island thing.
4138000	4141000	I was just on the plane.
4141000	4143000	I was just looking out at the sea and I was thinking,
4143000	4146000	how did Islam gear?
4147000	4149000	Like this is so far.
4150000	4152000	And there's so much water in between.
4153000	4157000	Like Allah's word just went everywhere.
4157000	4163000	And then I land in Kotakina, Peru and we're driving and it was a good hour and a half drive.
4163000	4165000	And I see a mountain.
4165000	4170000	And on the mountain, there's a calligraphy giant sign that says Allah.
4170000	4175000	Like the Hollywood side, except not to join them.
4175000	4178000	It was as a...
4179000	4182000	I was just baffled like, look at this.
4183000	4188000	These people want to just, they're driving and they're like, oh yeah, I should remember Allah.
4189000	4191000	You know?
4193000	4199000	To me, this Acharina Minhum, the blessing Allah gave to this online, the way that it spread,
4199000	4202000	is one of the most amazing miracles of this religion.
4202000	4204000	One of the most amazing things.
4204000	4210000	Finally, I'm going to share a quick comparison with you about Surat Al-Jumu'a and Surat Al-Munafiq.
4211000	4215000	At the end of Surat Al-Jumu'a, Allah says the people left the Prophet standing.
4215000	4217000	He was giving khutbah and the people left.
4217000	4219000	People walked away to that trade.
4219000	4221000	Right?
4221000	4225000	And the beginning of Surat Al-Munafiq, when some people come to the Prophet.
4225000	4226000	So look at the imagery.
4226000	4228000	At the end of one Surat, people are walking away from the Prophet.
4228000	4233000	In the beginning of the next one, people are coming to the Prophet and they're both wrong.
4233000	4234000	They're both wrong.
4234000	4240000	The ones who walked away got distracted and the ones who come are hypocrites trying to impress him.
4240000	4242000	They're coming for ingenuine reasons.
4242000	4245000	So, Al-Jumu'a says he gives people revelation.
4245000	4248000	He teaches people revelation so he can purify them.
4248000	4252000	And then there are people who hear this revelation but it doesn't purify them.
4252000	4257000	They take their faith as a shield to hide their real dirtiness.
4257000	4261000	So they're believers on the outside but really not believers on the inside.
4261000	4264000	And that's highlighted in Surat Al-Munafiq.
4264000	4272000	Allah says the people before us, they were given the responsibility of the Torah but they didn't carry it.
4272000	4275000	They were burdened but they didn't carry it.
4275000	4279000	This Surah says, hypocrites, they believed then they disbelieved.
4280000	4283000	You know why that's important?
4283000	4289000	When Allah talks about the Israelites in the Quran, he's actually not really only talking about the Israelites.
4289000	4291000	This is really important.
4291000	4296000	When he's talking about the Israelites, who do you think he's talking about?
4296000	4298000	He's talking about us.
4298000	4303000	This is a really important principle of the Quran. It happens over and over again.
4303000	4304000	They were talked about.
4304000	4308000	By the way, the word used for them will be indisputably, method, their example.
4308000	4312000	When is a teacher given example? When is a parent given example?
4312000	4317000	The example is given to benefit the student.
4317000	4320000	The example is not the goal.
4320000	4324000	The example is just a means to learn the lesson for you.
4324000	4329000	So when Allah says, muthel for them, it's because, look at what a lesson is about but he's like,
4329000	4334000	No, he said that because you look like that, homie.
4334000	4336000	That's why he's saying it.
4336000	4339000	There's a direct correlation being made.
4339000	4344000	So I'll quickly run to the end of this.
4344000	4351000	Allah says in Surat Al-Jumu'ah, he says, fas'aw ila dikr illa, rush to the remembrance of Allah.
4351000	4358000	In Surat Al-Mulafiq, he flips it and says, don't let your money and kids distract you from the remembrance of Allah.
4358000	4364000	In Surat Al-Jumu'ah, he says, remember Allah a lot so you can succeed.
4364000	4367000	I'll say that again. Remember Allah a lot so you can what?
4367000	4371000	Succeed. Okay, okay. What's the opposite of succeed?
4371000	4375000	He says, wama yafa'al dalika fa'u laika humul khasirun in the next Surat.
4375000	4381000	And whoever gets distracted from remembering Allah, those are the people that have failed.
4381000	4384000	One Surah says, remember Allah to succeed.
4384000	4386000	The other says, you get distracted and you will what?
4386000	4388000	Fail. You see a connection?
4388000	4396000	And I wanted to illustrate this to you so you understand how Surahs move in like there's a structure, there's a method, there's a continuity.
4396000	4401000	And this is your concluding comment and I'll give you guys a good, you've earned a good 10 minute break.
4401000	4405000	Mashallah, you've been very good. So I'm going to give you your first 10 minute break soon.
4405000	4408000	These are the three sections of Surat Al-Juva'ah.
4408000	4412000	It's 11 ayat, but it's going to be broken up into three sections.
4412000	4418000	And hopefully today we can do one ayah from the first section.
4418000	4424000	Hopefully. I don't think it's going to happen now, but this is what we're going to go through.
4424000	4429000	And at the whenever we reach the end of a section, I'll give you an overview of that section.
4429000	4432000	Then we'll get to the end of the second section and an overview.
4432000	4435000	Then the third one, then an overview of the entire Surah.
4435000	4440000	And this is sort of my method in giving these lectures on the Surahs and Shah-i-Llutada.
4440000	4443000	So with that, I'm going to give you guys your first 10 minute break.
4443000	4445000	And within 10 minutes, I'll be back here talking again.
4445000	4447000	Jazakumul Alaykum.
