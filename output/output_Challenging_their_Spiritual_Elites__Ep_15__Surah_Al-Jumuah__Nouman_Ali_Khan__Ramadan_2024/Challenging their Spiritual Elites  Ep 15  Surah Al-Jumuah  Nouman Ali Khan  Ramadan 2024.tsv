0	4240	Because usually, when you're trying to convert people to a new religion,
4240	7120	you're trying to get the least knowledgeable people
7120	8920	because they're easier to convert.
8920	12480	So you might go into the villages where the very poor people are,
12480	13840	give them some food,
13840	17440	and then invite them to your little religious gathering and easy to convert.
17440	19840	Which is by the way, some religions do that nowadays too.
19840	20560	Right?
20560	24560	But they won't go to the cultural capitals or the learning capitals.
24560	27360	They're not going to go to the universities, you see?
27600	29680	This is one of the things that makes Islam unique.
29680	33840	The Quran wasn't challenging the people who know the least of the other religion.
33840	37520	The Quran was inviting the people who know the most of the other religion.
57920	58800	Alhamdulillah.
62720	64080	Everyone once again, day four.
66640	69440	We move on from the two core ayaat of the surah,
69440	71440	the first two ayaat of the surah now.
71440	77120	And the third ayaat of this surah is actually grammatically connected to the second ayaat.
77120	80720	So this happens in the Quran where you may have multiple ayaas,
80720	82720	but actually there's still one sentence.
83520	83760	Right?
83760	86000	The easiest example of that is Alhamdulillah,
88240	91120	Maniki and Mindin is actually one sentence.
91120	92400	Grammatically it's one sentence.
92400	92880	Similarly,
96480	97760	is actually one sentence.
97760	99440	It's not multiple sentences.
99440	102720	So there are multiple ayaat, but there's still just one sentence.
102720	107200	So the same thing happens here is actually from the previous ayaa.
107200	109840	You notice, grammar students will notice the first word here is
111280	113520	which is not in the rafa form.
113520	114400	It's not aaharun.
114960	117200	Had it been aaharun, you could argue that this
117280	118240	is a new sentence.
118960	125920	But because it's monsoob, the nusb condition of it is impacted by something that came before.
125920	130560	And this might sound alien to some of you that haven't studied a little bit of Arabic grammar
130560	132320	or Arabic studies.
132320	136400	And my intention is also to make you curious about how do you figure that stuff out.
136400	137520	It's really not that hard.
137520	138640	And inshallah you'll get there.
139680	143040	By the end of the program, I'll show you a pathway you can take to get there,
143040	144480	inshallah, on your own.
144480	148160	Anyway, so wa ahadinaminhum, a rough translation.
148160	150240	Then we'll get into the dafsir matters.
150240	151360	And there are others.
152320	155440	And then there's the complicated phrase, others from them.
156080	158560	There are yet others from them.
159440	160880	Now, what does that mean?
160880	165120	There are more people other than the book, you know, the ones that he purified,
165120	168800	the ones that he read the ayaat to, the ones that he teaches the law and the book,
168800	170880	the law and the wisdom to, right?
170880	173120	There are yet and those are the ummiyeen.
173120	174960	Yet there are others from them.
176480	176960	Or
176960	180000	لما يلحقوا بههم that have not yet joined them.
180640	182800	They haven't joined them yet.
182800	183440	What does that mean?
183440	184160	They're about to.
184880	186480	What is with عزيز with حكيم?
186480	189040	And he is the ultimate authority and all wives.
189040	191360	That's the rough translation of the ayaat.
191360	193440	We're going to start with some commentary today.
193440	196880	I'm going to read some things to you that I think you should be exposed to.
196880	199040	And here's just some insights from different scholars like
199040	201920	ابن عاشور رحمه الله in his التحريب التنويل.
202160	215120	This is an unseen prediction.
215120	219200	Meaning the Quran has given a prediction of the future to the Prophet
219200	223360	صلى الله عليه وسلم that this message and this invitation of the
223360	227520	Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is going to reach other nations that are not Arab.
227840	232720	فارس والأرمن والأكراد والبربر والسودان.
232720	234640	You can tell these are different names of nations right?
235200	238800	والروم والتورك والتطار والمهول والصين.
238800	241200	Anyone know what is China?
242080	243840	China والهنوط.
243840	244800	Anyone know what is this?
245440	251920	The Indians the Tatars the Persians the the the the Armenians the
252000	257360	Barbar the Sudanese the Romans the Turks the Tatars then وغيرهم
257360	262320	and even beyond them وهاذة من معجزات القرآن من سنف الأخبار بالمغيبات
262320	264400	and this is part of the miracles of the Quran.
264400	268640	One of the miracles of the Quran that Allah told the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
268640	272560	of how international this religion is going to be others
272560	276160	beyond them are going to be joining that haven't joined them yet.
276160	280560	وفي الآية دلالة على عمومي رسالة ابن بي صلى الله عليه وسلم
280640	286800	يجمير الأمم and in this ayah there is evidence this serves as an evidence of how universal
286800	290160	the prophethood of our prophet is صلى الله عليه وسلم for all nations.
290720	296080	You see so far Allah has sent prophets up until Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم
296080	299280	Allah sent prophets to particular nations right?
299280	304560	Messengers came to particular nations with a mission and they weren't sent to all of humanity
304560	307040	like they have to be concerned with all of humanity.
307040	311520	The closest to that you get in the history of the world is Ibrahim
311520	317360	عليه السلام but even he wasn't sent to all nations he was concerned for all nations
317360	318960	there's a difference right?
318960	323360	And he made a dua for all nations and he wanted to help all nations
323360	328560	but he wasn't sent as a mission to all nations but our messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم
328560	332640	his mission began with the region in which he was born and raised
332640	335600	رسولة منهم فيهم رسولة منهم we saw that
336240	339520	but then even before his life came to an end in this world
340160	345440	then he already instructed how the mission is supposed to now become beyond the borders of
345440	346720	the Arabs right?
346720	353120	So Islam starts spreading outside of that hijaz region outside of that desert even within
353120	359360	his own lifetime he's engaging with outside territories and this was part of the plan of
359360	362080	Allah and he's hinting at that plan inside
362400	365920	وَاَاَصْلَيْنَا مِنْهُمْ لَمْمَا يَلْحَقُوبِهِمْ فَهُوَنْ عَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمِ
365920	370400	Okay so now we're going to rediscuss something because this is connected to the previous
370400	374560	ayah we're going to rediscuss the concept of al-ummiyeen so far I told you these are
374560	378320	the unlettered uneducated people people that didn't have knowledge of the scripture
378320	380160	we're going to read some more things about them
380160	387680	وَاَصْلَجَ الْبُقَارِيْ وَاَمْسْلِمْ وَاَبُدَاوُدْ وَالْنِسَائِيْ عَنِبْنِ عُمرَ عَنِنَّ بِيْصَظَ اللَّهُمْ عَلِيْسَلَمْ قَالَ
387680	391360	This is a narration of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is found in Bukhari and in Muslim
392000	395840	and this is Imam al-Aloosi al-Ruh al-Ma'ani quoting this I'll translate it for you
396720	400480	اِنَّ أُمَّةٌ أُمْمِيَةٌ لَا نَكْتُبُوا وَدَا نَحْسُبُوا
400480	407440	We are an ummah that is ummiya meaning the same word ummiyun we are a nation that is ummi
407440	411600	which means we don't write and we don't do calculations in other words we don't have
411600	416320	you know universities and we don't have these you know philosophical libraries and all that kind
416320	421440	of stuff we don't have that intellectual heritage of learning and learning institutions like the
421440	426080	Greeks had or some other civilizations had right so we're not those people but
430560	434640	and what is intended by that is that they are as though they just came out of their moms I mentioned
434640	436480	that to you before right uh
436480	440960	لم يتعلم الكتابة والحصاب they didn't learn advanced mathematics or writing
441680	445440	فهم على جبالتيهم الأولى they are on their original essential nature
445440	449520	فَالُمِّي نِسبَةٌ إِلَا الْأُمْ الَّتِيْ وَدَدَتُهُ
449520	457040	So ummi is associated with um so the e the e parted ummiyun the the extra y that you hear
457040	461760	that's called the yah ad nisbah and we use that in many cultures it came from the Arabs and a bunch
461760	466400	of us just kind of in different languages copied it so if you're from Pakistan you're what
467200	470400	Pakistani right if you're from Iran what are you
471120	473040	Iranian if you're from Afghanistan you're what
473600	481120	Avlani right so yeah be um so lots of languages took on this e as an adjective
481680	488800	so Afghanistan is a place but Avlani is an adjective right or hind is a place but hindi is
488800	494400	an adjective right so the same way there's the word umma and how do you make umma an adjective
494400	498560	ummi that's called yah ad nisbah so that's the yah ad nisbah here nisbah
498560	503360	اِلَا الْأُمْ الَّتِيْ وَدَتُهُ so it's attributing it to the the the one so
503360	510160	Avlani is the one of Afghanistan the one tied to Afghanistan ummi is the one tied to the mother
511200	515120	in that sense you see so that's that's where the meaning comes from what this button
515120	519600	اِلَا اُمْمَةِ العَرَبْ and it's also been said that this is referring to the the
519600	525040	nation of the Arabs meaning ummiyoon the people that belong to the Arab nation umma
525920	531600	وَقِلَا إِلَا اُمْمِ الْقُرَى that it's referring to the the nations or the the capital
531600	536160	of the nations because the ummiyoon may refer to the people of Makkah let me explain that really
536160	541520	quickly why why could that refer to the people of Makkah that you know the capital city in any
541520	547280	country we call it the capital uh the Arabs would call it the mother of all the cities
547280	553520	that's the mother city okay so ummul qurah so ummul qurah ummul qurah is one of the names of Makkah
554240	559280	okay why because it's the capital in a sense the cultural and economic capital of the region
559840	564480	right and the religious capital of the region so it's the um of all the other towns it's the
564480	569280	mother of all the other towns and that's that name is used in the Quran to describe Makkah
570080	577520	so actually Allah even describes that he sent messengers many times to different ummul qurah
577520	582960	meaning he sent them to cultural capitals because if you if you spread the message of Islam for
582960	589360	example Musa A.S. was sent in the cultural capital of Egypt right right at the palace of the Pharaoh
590080	596640	because if you impact there it will have impact everywhere and which is also true when you have
596640	601840	you know the cultural capitals have influence and if you can have if you can make it there then you
601840	608080	will your message will spread far and wide right so influencing Makkah or winning over Makkah will
608080	613760	not just have impact over Makkah it will have impact over all the regions and perhaps in this
613760	619120	there's also an indication that Islam wasn't just going to go into small villages and on the
619120	624880	peripheries Islam was going to go into the capitals of every civilization you know it was going to
624880	630080	go to the capitals of Europe the capitals of Africa the capitals of Asia and it was going to go to
630080	636960	the centers of society the centers of learning and have an impact there at the top because usually
636960	641840	when you're trying to convert people to a new religion you're trying to get the least knowledgeable
641840	647200	people because they're easier to convert so you might go into the villages where the very poor
647200	652240	people are give them some food and then invite them to your little religious gathering and easy
652240	657280	to convert which is by the way some religions do that nowadays too right but they won't go to the
657280	663440	cultural capitals or the learning capitals they're not going to go to the universities you see this
663440	667440	is one of the things that makes Islam unique the Quran wasn't challenging the people who know the
667440	673120	least of the other religion the Quran was inviting the people who know the most of the other religion
673200	677600	it was reverse engineering this entire proselytizing process i'll read something more to you
683680	689520	so this became a tough seer discussion among scholars does ummiyyeen refer only to the Arabs
689520	694240	because they were of course for for thousands of years they didn't have any learning or religion or
694240	697760	you know profits coming to them in that way so are they the ones that it's meant
698160	706640	so it has also been said that any people who did not have previous knowledge of the scripture or
706640	711440	they did not know about this final scripture they can be considered ummi too meaning al-ajab
711440	719200	meaning the non-arab also also he had that interpretation that ummiyyeen is not just
719200	724160	about the Arabs it's about all people that are uneducated the Quran by the way has a hint
724160	729520	towards that if if we think ummiyyeen are just the Arabs then Allah wouldn't have said about the
729520	733520	Israelites who are not Arabs he said about them
737120	740560	so which means the ummiyyeen are not just Arabs they're among them too
743840	750800	and this this opinion has also been criticized historically because the non-arabs were not
750880	755440	unlettered they were not uneducated the Chinese were in advanced civilization the Persians were
755440	759760	in advanced civilization the Romans were in advanced civilization how can you call them ummiyyeen
759760	765040	I would argue against this criticism and say this does not mean they didn't know engineering and
765040	769280	they didn't know how to build roads and highways and giant buildings and monuments this means they
769280	774720	didn't have knowledge of Allah's revelation that's what makes them ummiyyeen you can have a phd
774720	780400	nowadays in engineering and you can be very educated in the worldly sense and still be what from
780480	784800	a spiritual perspective you could still be an ummi you don't know much about the book right
786000	791920	and those people have some things in common like Allah says people like that they don't know the
791920	797360	book itself except they just have some wishes some hopes and then they have to build their religion
797360	801680	on assumptions they assume what they heard is true and they don't have any direct knowledge right
801680	805680	that's the that's the state of the ummiyyeen
806560	814960	another opinion is because ummi comes from umma that this just means they come from different
814960	819840	nations they just they just belong to different nations it's not talking about them not reading
819840	832000	and writing there's a narration from different hadith sources
832320	834320	Abū Hūrīlāzī says
837680	844400	we were sitting with the Prophet ﷺ when Surat al-Jumu'ah came down so they were sitting together
844400	849120	and the Prophet received this surah and he started reciting it so he read it
857760	861360	because the ayah said that the Sahabah are listening and the Prophet recites these words
861440	863360	that we're studying now
863360	867360	one of the men said to the Prophet ﷺ
870080	871600	who are these people who haven't joined us
872160	875520	now so who are these people that haven't joined us when so he was curious
882880	886080	so the Prophet ﷺ put his hand on Salman al-Fārīsī
886080	887360	Salman al-Fārīsī is from where
888080	890080	it's from Persia right so it's from Persia
900080	902080	okay
906080	912080	had faith was a treasure that was hiding in the Pilates constellation in the sky
912800	915520	constellation in the sky called Pilates
915520	918720	so the Arabs were really big on the stars
918720	921360	some of you that may have heard my Surat al-Najm series in Ramadan
921360	924720	may have noticed the Arabs talked a lot about the stars
924720	927680	so this hadith is referring to the Pilates constellation
927680	931280	and at night the Arabs were very keen on that particular constellation
931280	934960	so if imā and if faith was all the way to Thorayah
934960	938800	people like this this kind of person these kinds of people would have reached that too
939520	943440	what he's saying is look at the journeys he took to find imā
943440	945840	and if you study the story of Salman al-Fārīsī
945840	950400	you'll know the kind of incredible journey he took to find this message
950960	955680	right and the religious turns he took and the the turmoil he went through
955680	959360	traversing the world to try to find the final Prophet ﷺ
959360	960240	and to find his imā
960240	963360	so he's saying these people would have found faith no matter what
963760	972000	so he indicated according to this towards Persia
972640	974640	so he highlighted Persia
979200	981920	and it's clear that they're not ummiyīn of the Arabs
982480	984080	they're a different kind of ummiyīn
984080	987920	right now a lot of scholars when they discussed this they talked about
987920	991600	oh this this means because of this hadith the ummiyīn means the Persians
992560	995760	right the ummiyīn means the I would argue against that also
995760	1001040	I would argue the Prophet ﷺ a lot of times to teach a lesson he gives an example
1002160	1006560	so what's a good example for you to understand who are these other people
1006560	1008800	what's the easiest example right there in the room
1009680	1014800	the soba al-Fārīsī you see this these kinds of people that doesn't mean oh the Persians only
1014800	1019200	no what it means is if this if this one came from the other side
1019760	1024080	so so much beyond the Arab territories how many more are there Allah didn't specify
1024880	1025920	and that's why so so
1025920	1033680	when Allah speaks in general terms he means general terms so it's actually referring to all nations
1033680	1038640	and the Persians are a specific category of them interestingly one of the things that's that's
1038640	1045680	got me really curious recently is just particularly Persia and the history of Persia the Farsi language
1045680	1054800	and Islam Farsi arguably has as much if not more Islamic literature in history than Arabic
1056000	1062400	and the scholars from around the world actually were producing their works in Arabic
1062400	1068400	and many of them were producing their works in in Farsi and even nowadays because you know because
1068400	1072480	of the Sunni Shi'a divide we think that when we think of Farsi we think of Shi'a literature or
1072480	1077600	something like that that is not the case historically at all actually the vast majority there's huge
1077600	1084480	volumes of literature that Muslims were were consuming the Seer works Hadith works Vik works
1084480	1090720	that were actually in in Farsi okay and there's a big big part of the and it didn't just come from
1090720	1096480	Iran is the crazy thing it was coming from all over the world and this became a part of the
1096480	1102320	Muslim heritage so the Muslim heritage is actually very multilingual one of the curiosities
1102320	1107920	I have in my own studies of the Quran I like to understand intellectual history also in other
1107920	1114560	words I know now because I come from the Indian Pakistani subcontinent background the people
1114560	1119840	there have a certain kind of thinking they have a certain kind of history they have they come from
1119840	1126960	a history of philosophy of music and poetry and they have that kind of and spirituality mysticism
1126960	1132400	you know they have that history and that impacted the way they looked at the Quran and they saw
1132400	1138560	things in the Quran that other other nations didn't see so they commented in a different way the Persians
1138560	1145200	have their own history of poetry and philosophy their own heritage and they were they were linguists
1145200	1150480	also they're very keen on language they were grammarians so when they come to the Quran they saw
1150480	1155120	something their interpretations of the Quran brought something new to the table and so the same
1155120	1160720	way the Andalusian scholars that were in Spain and the same way the African scholarship and the
1160720	1165520	same way you know scholarship for out from around the world because they have their own heritage and
1165520	1170960	culture then they're learning the Quran they're actually seeing things from different angles too
1170960	1175600	and they're bringing something more to the table right because they come from that heritage I'll
1175600	1180160	give you one example of that guys sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture
1180160	1184240	just before you continue I want to let you know and encourage you that I want you to sign up for
1184240	1189760	bayinatv.com and help other sign up or even sponsor students for bayinatv.com so we can create
1189760	1193840	worldwide communities of students that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the
1193840	1198880	Quran and are inshallah Ota'ala spreading that in their own circles thanks so much I'll give you
1198880	1205280	one example of that when you study when I studied the Arab tafasir right and the the tafasir that
1205280	1210880	come from Arab lands predominantly the one thing you will notice more than anything else is there's
1210960	1217200	a lot of focus on the word on every word there's a lot of focus right and it's in if you guys are
1217200	1223280	university students it's like micro studies yeah it's micro studies and then when you start studying
1223280	1229840	some Persian literature or some Urdu literature some subcontinental literature you'll notice
1229840	1235200	there's a lot of focus on the bigger picture they're saying okay what about this whole surah
1235200	1238640	where are we getting from the whole surah what about the whole page what about these
1238640	1244720	entire like they're they're zooming out what's that called it's macro studies right it's it's
1244720	1249360	there's a macro perspective there's a micro perspective and there's a macro perspective
1249360	1255200	and the the analogy I like to give is if you are a photographer and you're flying with a helicopter
1255200	1260560	over a valley and you take a really beautiful photo of the valley does that have value yeah of
1260560	1266400	course you captured a gorgeous scene but the helicopter lands and you zoom in on one flower
1266400	1270880	and one petal of that one flower and a bee sitting on that one petal of that one flower
1270880	1275600	and you take a picture does that have value also is that artistic also yeah it's the same
1276240	1281760	it's the same camera it's the same location but you can zoom in and you can zoom out and each one
1281760	1286960	of them has an advantage but each one of them has a disadvantage if you zoom out you miss the smaller
1286960	1293440	details and if you zoom in you miss the bigger picture and what's amazing about this umma is
1293440	1301040	that Allah did not restricts this umma's intellectual heritage to one culture so all these different
1301040	1307120	cultures with their own kind of you know like Germans are notoriously scientific in their thinking
1307120	1315360	and mathematical in their thinking right so imagine German scholarship on Islam right German
1315360	1320240	scholarship on Islam I know I know there's a lot of non-muslim German scholarship on Islam I know
1320240	1324800	that's existed for a couple of centuries actually I've read some of it too in translation I mean
1324800	1331520	do you remember German um but uh there's French scholarship on Islam there's Spanish scholarship
1331520	1338000	on Islam there's and I'm curious about you know different cultures scholarship on Islam and what
1338000	1342480	they brought to the table what they saw that other people just don't they don't have that lens so they
1342480	1349600	can't see it right and this is one of the great gifts that Allah gave to our religion you know you
1349600	1354560	might be fascinated to know this Allah said ahadin all others will join them you think others okay so
1354560	1361920	few more will join actually the majority of the umma is Arabs the minority is Arabs the vast majority
1361920	1367920	of the umma is actually non-Arabs and that happened very early on extremely early on they're the
1367920	1373680	nucleus but that it just spread and kept on spreading and spreading and spreading the analogy of
1373680	1379120	Islam is like a seed right you plant a seed a tree grows but the tree has lots of fruits that
1379120	1384480	those fruits have seeds those seeds spread and it just and it spread like almost like pollen
1385200	1390880	that's how it spread and I actually Allah gave the analogy of la idaha idvallah as a tree you know
1390880	1403040	you know the example of the tree the roots are deep and the branches go into the sky and that
1403040	1407360	analogy is pretty amazing because actually that's kind of what happened in the world with Islam
1408080	1413200	you know we traveled like the wind we traveled everywhere and we just spread and spread and
1413200	1422240	spread so I I say this not just because it's a cool observation I have a request from all of you
1423040	1429360	you're all many of you are from different heritage different backgrounds right and when you
1430080	1434400	you know you you modernize and you you know the world moves forward and we have to learn the
1434480	1438640	language in which we can get a job and we can we have to learn the language of the university
1438640	1445680	a lot of times the younger generation loses the mother language right so for example I speak Urdu
1446560	1452400	but then I was most of my adult life I was in in the United States so I didn't speak Urdu much
1453280	1457360	right and then I started losing touch with Urdu and the only when I started getting back into
1457360	1461680	Islam I said okay I'm gonna read the Arabic if I see but I'm also gonna read Urdu literature
1461680	1465440	so at least I have two civilizations I have access to right so I started reading Urdu materials a
1465440	1471680	lot too so that kept me in touch with Urdu but while living in New York and living in Texas
1471680	1477840	I'm keeping in touch with my Urdu then after 30 years I went back to Pakistan 29 years to be exact
1477840	1483120	so I haven't been back for 29 years I go back and I start speaking and a young man came to me and
1483120	1490560	said you speak old people Urdu he literally said you speak Nawabi Urdu and I was like huh
1491840	1495760	and the reason he said that is because in those 30 years what happened to the Urdu language
1496880	1503920	it deteriorated it actually declined and so the amazing literature in Urdu that
1504560	1510480	your grandmother could appreciate or even I could appreciate I'd say like a grandma now but yes
1511600	1517520	now the next generation has less contact with it you you understand I think it's as important
1518320	1523920	learning the Arabic language is number one but alongside it whatever heritage you come from
1523920	1530080	you should master that language you shouldn't just speak it to just casually hang out you should
1530080	1534960	actually know its heritage its legacy especially if you're lucky enough to know something about Farsi
1535680	1540400	or you know the languages in which Muslims have a heritage Muslims have a history if
1540400	1544400	if Muslims have been in the region for a couple of hundred years or more then there's a scholarly
1544480	1550720	history in that literature in that in those works and you can bring that out you can expose that to
1550720	1556480	the rest of the world you know to the rest of the umma so they may be able to benefit anyway so
1557360	1562640	the aakhirin amin hum lammayal haqoobihim they haven't yet joined them lammayal just this is a small
1562640	1568640	grammar note manfiyu ha mus'tamir ilal hal this is a word and it means negative but negative up until
1568640	1574000	now wa yutawakka'u wukooruhu ba'dahu and it's expected that it will happen right after so just
1574080	1579040	like you say hey it has it has it's not come yet not yet there's an expectation that he's coming
1579040	1584320	right so Allah has set the expectation that more Muslims are now coming that are not from among the
1584320	1591200	Arabs this is about to get bigger and bigger and bigger okay this is really cool also al
1591200	1595840	al-yalhaqoobihim alhaqoobihim is joined is translated as they haven't joined them yet that's how
1595840	1601280	he translated it they haven't joined them yet but al-ahik bin al-thimar is actually this word is used
1601280	1606400	for fruits that come on the same tree one season after another season after another season so the
1606400	1611280	you know the next season's fruit the next season's fruit that's called al-ahik min al-thimar which is
1611280	1618640	really awesome because now we're being described as new fruits from the same tree right so the tree
1618640	1625200	starts with the sahaba it's the same tree and then newer and newer fruits are emerging with every
1625200	1630720	season and we're just another season of those fruits but the tree we belong to the same exact
1630720	1637360	tree it's such a beautiful connection to our history to these people that Allah has made you
1637360	1643760	know nations they pride themselves on their own history right and now because of after colonialism
1643760	1649680	there's a lot of you know because we're all nation states now right so you know you have a region
1649680	1654880	where they're all geographically actually very close to each other culturally they're close to
1654880	1660080	each other language wise they're close to each other but the the British or the French or the
1660560	1664560	you know the day not the Danes but the Dutch or whoever they'll come and draw a line and say okay
1664560	1669520	you guys are Malaysian you guys are Indonesian okay you guys are Pakistan you guys are India you
1669520	1674480	guys are Bangladesh you guys are Sri Lanka you guys they'll draw these lines right and it's been it
1674480	1679440	hasn't even been a hundred years since those lines but people now identify themselves inside these
1679440	1684640	lines right and then there's national pride and your flag and if there's a sport if there's a
1684640	1691920	match going on and everybody's waving their flag you know that kind of thing but what Allah did
1691920	1698720	is so remarkable that he actually joined us to people that we don't have any genetic connection to
1699680	1704720	we don't even have a geographical connection to them we're not even from the same region the
1704720	1709680	Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam is in hijaz and the Indonesian is on the other side of the world
1709920	1716400	and they're connected and they're bonded together and that bond is thicker than blood
1717360	1723840	it's thicker than blood and you know like the the the tree that gives a fruit right the fruit is
1723840	1729680	almost identical from the previous year's fruits it's the same it's not a different fruit it's the
1729680	1734000	same fruit it's a new manifestation of the fruit the only time the fruit goes bad is if there's not
1734000	1740080	enough water not enough sun something went bad right but the potential to produce amazing fruit
1740080	1747200	is always there isn't it so the idea inside this analogy is also that as generations go by it's not
1747200	1753120	like oh Muslims are just going to be a inferior product the good ones are all dead and the new ones
1753120	1760160	are you know the all the amazing Muslims died and us losers are the only ones left you know this kind
1760240	1764880	of mentality is also problematic because Allah has acknowledged those who will be coming and joining
1764880	1771440	them and he did not make them feel make them seem inferior right or the other and I've said this in
1771440	1778960	previous lectures but it's important to note the Arabic language is such a deep part of the of Arab
1778960	1787120	culture just like or do or Farsi or Bahasa or you know Swahili or Senegalese are part of their own
1787120	1795840	culture but Arabic Allah took it from the Arabs and he said you can't keep it for yourself you can
1795840	1803680	have it but I'm gonna make this the language of the entire Oma they're all gonna have it they're
1803680	1812800	all gonna share it so you don't have to be Arab to be Arab you just have to know Arabic
1812800	1819680	in the Arab listen Arabs are just a tongue that's all it is no other language oh once you speak it
1819680	1826640	you're that person not really you can speak German you can act German but you're not German
1828560	1835440	you know like it was pretty funny I was one time I was in back in the day I was in New York I was
1835440	1841040	taking a walk it was a big it's a big Russian neighborhood and I clearly don't look Russian
1842000	1846320	and this guy and he didn't even speak English properly he's a Russian dude
1846320	1850560	but he's just steady he can't stand that I'm walking by this Russian neighbor he goes
1850560	1871120	go back to your country let's go together okay now we have to this this idea of others joining
1871120	1876240	we have to learn something about Jewish studies Hebrew studies that is going to help us gain
1876240	1882080	some perspective about this Ia I told you that in this Surah the word Quddus right the word Yuzaki
1882080	1886480	him there are other implications that this is actually there's a secondary audience which is some
1886480	1891200	some some of the factions of the rabbis right not all of them but some of them so we're gonna
1891200	1896720	read some things from some rabbinic attitudes towards Gentiles and the Goyim this is courtesy
1896720	1901760	of Dr. Sakit Hossain who's a dear friend and colleague of mine who's finished his PhD out of
1901760	1906320	Oxford in biblical studies Alhamdulillah he's a scholar of the Quran and he's also
1906320	1911120	has mastered the Hebrew language and has studied the Torah and Jewish scholarship pretty extensively
1911120	1916720	and writes about the correlation between the two so I and he's on my WhatsApp so I can flex that so
1916720	1922000	I just say hey bro I gotta give can you give me a non-phd version because I gotta talk to humans
1922560	1928080	so then he'll just send me like so this is from WhatsApp messages is the the truth okay the source
1928160	1934480	and concerning bloodshed in what matters is the so this is about this is their fatawa on killing
1935440	1942000	in their literature a non-ju against a non-ju and a non-ju against a ju is liable a ju against a
1942000	1950320	non-ju is exempt meaning if a member of the Israelites kills a non-ju it's not a crime
1950320	1956240	they're exempt okay and concerning theft in in what matter is the transgressors capable
1956800	1961840	in case of kidnapper a thief the one who seizes a beautiful war captive you see where that's going
1961840	1967600	and the like a non-ju against a non-ju and a non-ju against a ju is prohibited a ju against a
1967600	1973360	non-ju is permitted so there was this idea that these people you can do anything you want with them
1973360	1977840	in some of their groups not all of them but some of them developed this idea that us the believers
1977840	1982000	they saw themselves as the believers we can do anything with these kufar they're basically less
1982000	1990160	than human right which should sound scarily familiar because there are some muslims you if
1990160	1994640	if i just change the words muslim and non-muslim is from ju lanju you would think this is some
1996000	2000720	some muslims that are saying this nowadays right this the source of it is the tosefta it's one
2000720	2006400	of the earliest rabbinic texts along with the mishnah this was written around 200 bc the the
2006400	2011840	source the chapter is called bodh azadah which means outsider worship which is a chapter within it
2011840	2018320	okay let's keep going why are the gentiles impure meaning why are non-ju is impure uh in their in
2018320	2024960	their mind why are the kufar impure okay some rabbinic writings several classical jewish reports
2024960	2031440	give the view that the serpent who tempted even the garden actually copulated with her that's
2031440	2038400	weird but yes that's actually their interpretation which is why humanity is tainted by sin this is
2038400	2043600	similar to the christian idea of original sin but then israel is standing at mount syni Israel
2043600	2049680	in standing at mount syni had their filth cease non-jews who did not stand at the mount syni
2049680	2056560	did not have their filth cease when they stood at mount syni i told you the account that the
2056560	2063040	Quran describes the conversation this is their version of that conversation their version among
2063040	2068160	some of them the conversation is when they stood at mount syni they were forever purified and
2068160	2073520	everybody else they're not just their filth did not end actually they believe human beings are born
2073520	2079360	filthy because the children of adam are actually how what it was not with adam how what was with
2079360	2085200	the serpent that's what they're basically saying so this is their the jewish version in some rabbinic
2085200	2091120	traditions of original sin we don't believe in original sin they have that concept right the
2091120	2096480	general rule in early Judaism was that the categories of pure and not pure did not apply to
2096480	2101840	jews by the time you get to the Talmud which is completed around the sixth century there is much
2101840	2107680	harsher view in which Gentiles are considered impure uh so and this is some more details we
2107680	2111840	don't have to get into the details but let's go back to why i brought all of this up
2112480	2115280	Allah says
2115280	2120800	ummiyyin is basically their equivalent of non-jews Gentiles which they by definition consider what
2121760	2129440	what do they consider them impure he says he raised among the impure and from their perspective
2129440	2132560	and then what does he say about them he purifies them
2133600	2139360	what you say key him you see what's happening here their view was what so long as you're under
2139360	2145280	the mountain you are purified unless saying no the only thing that will purify you is the word of Allah
2146320	2150240	and this messenger is coming to the ummiyyin and he's purifying them and in this next slide
2150320	2155600	that we're studying now and by the way the only people who can access the Torah and access the
2155600	2161840	word of God are the most pure people but now these ummiyyin that are supposedly impure not only are
2161840	2167760	they getting purified now that he's going to teach them the the Quran the book he's gonna teach them
2167760	2172800	the book the purest of all scriptures he's gonna teach them that so now there's a shift in the
2172800	2178160	definition of purity purity is not coming from a certain race like in certain classes of hinduism
2178160	2183440	certain races certain classes of people are pure people and certain others are then it right
2183440	2188400	they're the untouchables they are the the the lower classes this didn't just happen in in in one
2188400	2195520	civilization there are many uh in korea in china in india there are many class societies where if
2195520	2199680	you're born into a certain kind of class you will remain in that class you cannot come out of that
2199680	2206000	class you are you are born into impurity you're born into it and you have to escape it somehow
2206000	2212480	right and the the christians even adopted it as a doctrine all human beings are born into sin
2212480	2217920	they're born dirty they're born impure and only through the blood of jesus can they be purified
2217920	2223600	and quran comes along it says no no no no hold on this is all made up the truth is every human being
2223600	2229520	is born pure fitlidallah that the fatala nasa adiha and the corruption comes at the hands of people
2229520	2235920	you weren't designed impure you were designed pure it's a it's a fundamentally different definition
2236480	2240000	than what you're getting in other religious traditions and by the way it those of you that
2240000	2245200	are students of psychology this is an interesting small fact if you believe human beings are
2245200	2252880	fundamentally impure born into sin lower class whatever you're born into sin then you are
2252880	2258480	from the beginning broken you're broken from the beginning and you just have to spend your life
2258480	2265680	identifying how you can undo the damage that's un inevitable you're already damaged right and
2265680	2271920	when you study Freudian psychology which is the father of modern psychology right you will notice
2271920	2277440	that that the definition of human beings they're bored they're born with certain essentially
2277440	2284560	psychological defects we're all basically disturbed subconsciously and i won't spell out how we're
2284960	2289600	disturbed if you're going to study Freud you'll know for yourself and then it's manifesting further
2289600	2295120	down the road as now in you know pop psychology pop psychology means anybody on twitter becomes a
2295120	2300800	therapist you know let me tell you how to deal with your emotions right everybody's a counselor
2300800	2308000	everybody's a therapist everybody's licensed to i love life coaches i love these guys are amazing
2308000	2314960	like certified certified life coach the the the the most entertaining ones are the muslim ones
2316560	2322080	certified good believer that and what's there you know how people put reviews underneath
2322640	2326240	the review is this is a really good person it's like oh okay
2330800	2336240	but the idea in all of these kinds of brands of therapy and i'm actually a very eager student
2336240	2341680	of psychology and i appreciate the science is that oh you were probably traumatized by this
2341680	2345920	or that or the other and you're still dealing with your trauma and you haven't healed and you're just
2345920	2350000	going to spend your life undoing the effects of the trauma and everybody walks out of therapy like
2350000	2355840	yep i'm a traumatized victim i'm i'm just i'm just trauma walking around and then you go you go
2355840	2361120	somewhere you go to your coffee place and the guy takes two extra minutes to bring your coffee
2361600	2366960	i'm traumatized by this late delivery and i got triggered and you're just you're just living in
2366960	2374640	trauma right but the the the quran's argument actually is that you were born pure and then dirt
2374640	2379600	came on and then when revelation comes the dirt comes off again you's a key him where you are
2379600	2384400	leaving the book about what hit about profound difference okay now why is this important that
2384400	2392480	means all nations are now equally blessed there's no more one blessed ethnicity the you know the the
2392480	2396720	the all the african nations are blessed all the australians are blessed the aborigines are blessed
2396720	2402320	the native americans are blessed the europeans are blessed there's no better or worse nation they're
2402320	2408160	all now equal because akharid i'm in home covers everybody all nations are now an extension of the
2408160	2412960	ummeyin which means the ummeyin didn't know any better and they could be purified you could have
2413040	2417280	been living in a society where there's thousands of years of shit doesn't matter you can be purified
2417280	2422800	too you're just just like them and purity is no longer about a special class or a lineage
2423600	2429440	you're not born royal you're not born special everyone's born special and purity is about
2429440	2434880	what you do with your life after that okay so now this this was just a few things about that
2434880	2439520	ayah well i'm in home let me have hope will be him i will just add one more thing as we as we
2439520	2449600	start this second this next ayah which is that you know Allah made us an umma that could not
2449600	2456640	distinguish between which race we come from and yet at the same time Allah says
2456640	2463920	he made you into nations and tribes so you can get to know each other and there's an interesting
2463920	2471120	tidbit there about shuroban shuroban arabic shab means people in modern arabic shab means people
2471120	2476880	but shab in old arabic actually used to mean a hole in the wall sometimes you have a wall it's got a
2476880	2482480	little crack in it or a hole in it and what do you have to do you have to fill it up right
2482480	2488800	shab are called people but not perfect people they have a hole they have some kind of crack
2488800	2494160	and some other shab have a different kind of crack and some other shab have a different kind of crack
2494160	2499680	and when you meet other people you're like i can learn something from you that i can fill my gap my
2499680	2505440	crack with there's a crack in my wall that i can fix by learning from you and you can learn something
2505440	2511680	for me that can fix the crack in your wall so when when believers have cultural exchange they learn
2511680	2517280	from each other they actually better each other and Allah designed this system of just a a bunch of
2517280	2522320	nations that have many strengths and some weaknesses and somebody's weakness is somebody else's what
2523200	2528720	strength and it's just this thing of beauty Allah created right which is kind of what i was saying
2528720	2533920	even in our intellectual histories in it there's a micro view but the micro view has one disadvantage
2533920	2538640	that you don't get the macro picture so there's these are one shab they have this kind of view
2538640	2544560	not another shab have that kind of view you know you were able to merge between the two of them
2545440	2547440	shawab and the tribes that you know
2549040	2552880	Salamu Alaikum everyone there are almost 50,000 students around the world
2552880	2557280	that are interested on top of the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings
