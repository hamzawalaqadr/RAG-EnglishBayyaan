{"text": " Because usually, when you're trying to convert people to a new religion, you're trying to get the least knowledgeable people because they're easier to convert. So you might go into the villages where the very poor people are, give them some food, and then invite them to your little religious gathering and easy to convert. Which is by the way, some religions do that nowadays too. Right? But they won't go to the cultural capitals or the learning capitals. They're not going to go to the universities, you see? This is one of the things that makes Islam unique. The Quran wasn't challenging the people who know the least of the other religion. The Quran was inviting the people who know the most of the other religion. Alhamdulillah. Everyone once again, day four. We move on from the two core ayaat of the surah, the first two ayaat of the surah now. And the third ayaat of this surah is actually grammatically connected to the second ayaat. So this happens in the Quran where you may have multiple ayaas, but actually there's still one sentence. Right? The easiest example of that is Alhamdulillah, Maniki and Mindin is actually one sentence. Grammatically it's one sentence. Similarly, is actually one sentence. It's not multiple sentences. So there are multiple ayaat, but there's still just one sentence. So the same thing happens here is actually from the previous ayaa. You notice, grammar students will notice the first word here is which is not in the rafa form. It's not aaharun. Had it been aaharun, you could argue that this is a new sentence. But because it's monsoob, the nusb condition of it is impacted by something that came before. And this might sound alien to some of you that haven't studied a little bit of Arabic grammar or Arabic studies. And my intention is also to make you curious about how do you figure that stuff out. It's really not that hard. And inshallah you'll get there. By the end of the program, I'll show you a pathway you can take to get there, inshallah, on your own. Anyway, so wa ahadinaminhum, a rough translation. Then we'll get into the dafsir matters. And there are others. And then there's the complicated phrase, others from them. There are yet others from them. Now, what does that mean? There are more people other than the book, you know, the ones that he purified, the ones that he read the ayaat to, the ones that he teaches the law and the book, the law and the wisdom to, right? There are yet and those are the ummiyeen. Yet there are others from them. Or \u0644\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0644\u062d\u0642\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0647\u0647\u0645 that have not yet joined them. They haven't joined them yet. What does that mean? They're about to. What is with \u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 with \u062d\u0643\u064a\u0645? And he is the ultimate authority and all wives. That's the rough translation of the ayaat. We're going to start with some commentary today. I'm going to read some things to you that I think you should be exposed to. And here's just some insights from different scholars like \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0648\u0631 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 in his \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0644. This is an unseen prediction. Meaning the Quran has given a prediction of the future to the Prophet \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 that this message and this invitation of the Prophet \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 is going to reach other nations that are not Arab. \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0628\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646. You can tell these are different names of nations right? \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0635\u064a\u0646. Anyone know what is China? China \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u0648\u0637. Anyone know what is this? The Indians the Tatars the Persians the the the the Armenians the Barbar the Sudanese the Romans the Turks the Tatars then \u0648\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0645 and even beyond them \u0648\u0647\u0627\u0630\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u062c\u0632\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u064a\u0628\u0627\u062a and this is part of the miracles of the Quran. One of the miracles of the Quran that Allah told the Prophet \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 of how international this religion is going to be others beyond them are going to be joining that haven't joined them yet. \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0622\u064a\u0629 \u062f\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0645\u0648\u0645\u064a \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0628\u064a \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0645 and in this ayah there is evidence this serves as an evidence of how universal the prophethood of our prophet is \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 for all nations. You see so far Allah has sent prophets up until Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 Allah sent prophets to particular nations right? Messengers came to particular nations with a mission and they weren't sent to all of humanity like they have to be concerned with all of humanity. The closest to that you get in the history of the world is Ibrahim \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 but even he wasn't sent to all nations he was concerned for all nations there's a difference right? And he made a dua for all nations and he wanted to help all nations but he wasn't sent as a mission to all nations but our messenger \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 his mission began with the region in which he was born and raised \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 we saw that but then even before his life came to an end in this world then he already instructed how the mission is supposed to now become beyond the borders of the Arabs right? So Islam starts spreading outside of that hijaz region outside of that desert even within his own lifetime he's engaging with outside territories and this was part of the plan of Allah and he's hinting at that plan inside \u0648\u064e\u0627\u064e\u0627\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0652 \u0641\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0632\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0643\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650 Okay so now we're going to rediscuss something because this is connected to the previous ayah we're going to rediscuss the concept of al-ummiyeen so far I told you these are the unlettered uneducated people people that didn't have knowledge of the scripture we're going to read some more things about them \u0648\u064e\u0627\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0644\u064e\u062c\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064f\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0652\u0644\u0650\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u064e\u0628\u064f\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0648\u064f\u062f\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0646\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0639\u064f\u0645\u0631\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0628\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0638\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e This is a narration of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is found in Bukhari and in Muslim and this is Imam al-Aloosi al-Ruh al-Ma'ani quoting this I'll translate it for you \u0627\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0623\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064c \u0623\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629\u064c \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u0643\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0633\u064f\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0627 We are an ummah that is ummiya meaning the same word ummiyun we are a nation that is ummi which means we don't write and we don't do calculations in other words we don't have you know universities and we don't have these you know philosophical libraries and all that kind of stuff we don't have that intellectual heritage of learning and learning institutions like the Greeks had or some other civilizations had right so we're not those people but and what is intended by that is that they are as though they just came out of their moms I mentioned that to you before right uh \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0635\u0627\u0628 they didn't learn advanced mathematics or writing \u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0649 they are on their original essential nature \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0645\u0650\u0651\u064a \u0646\u0650\u0633\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064c \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062a\u064f\u0647\u064f So ummi is associated with um so the e the e parted ummiyun the the extra y that you hear that's called the yah ad nisbah and we use that in many cultures it came from the Arabs and a bunch of us just kind of in different languages copied it so if you're from Pakistan you're what Pakistani right if you're from Iran what are you Iranian if you're from Afghanistan you're what Avlani right so yeah be um so lots of languages took on this e as an adjective so Afghanistan is a place but Avlani is an adjective right or hind is a place but hindi is an adjective right so the same way there's the word umma and how do you make umma an adjective ummi that's called yah ad nisbah so that's the yah ad nisbah here nisbah \u0627\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062a\u064f\u0647\u064f so it's attributing it to the the the one so Avlani is the one of Afghanistan the one tied to Afghanistan ummi is the one tied to the mother in that sense you see so that's that's where the meaning comes from what this button \u0627\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0652 and it's also been said that this is referring to the the nation of the Arabs meaning ummiyoon the people that belong to the Arab nation umma \u0648\u064e\u0642\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0649 that it's referring to the the nations or the the capital of the nations because the ummiyoon may refer to the people of Makkah let me explain that really quickly why why could that refer to the people of Makkah that you know the capital city in any country we call it the capital uh the Arabs would call it the mother of all the cities that's the mother city okay so ummul qurah so ummul qurah ummul qurah is one of the names of Makkah okay why because it's the capital in a sense the cultural and economic capital of the region right and the religious capital of the region so it's the um of all the other towns it's the mother of all the other towns and that's that name is used in the Quran to describe Makkah so actually Allah even describes that he sent messengers many times to different ummul qurah meaning he sent them to cultural capitals because if you if you spread the message of Islam for example Musa A.S. was sent in the cultural capital of Egypt right right at the palace of the Pharaoh because if you impact there it will have impact everywhere and which is also true when you have you know the cultural capitals have influence and if you can have if you can make it there then you will your message will spread far and wide right so influencing Makkah or winning over Makkah will not just have impact over Makkah it will have impact over all the regions and perhaps in this there's also an indication that Islam wasn't just going to go into small villages and on the peripheries Islam was going to go into the capitals of every civilization you know it was going to go to the capitals of Europe the capitals of Africa the capitals of Asia and it was going to go to the centers of society the centers of learning and have an impact there at the top because usually when you're trying to convert people to a new religion you're trying to get the least knowledgeable people because they're easier to convert so you might go into the villages where the very poor people are give them some food and then invite them to your little religious gathering and easy to convert which is by the way some religions do that nowadays too right but they won't go to the cultural capitals or the learning capitals they're not going to go to the universities you see this is one of the things that makes Islam unique the Quran wasn't challenging the people who know the least of the other religion the Quran was inviting the people who know the most of the other religion it was reverse engineering this entire proselytizing process i'll read something more to you so this became a tough seer discussion among scholars does ummiyyeen refer only to the Arabs because they were of course for for thousands of years they didn't have any learning or religion or you know profits coming to them in that way so are they the ones that it's meant so it has also been said that any people who did not have previous knowledge of the scripture or they did not know about this final scripture they can be considered ummi too meaning al-ajab meaning the non-arab also also he had that interpretation that ummiyyeen is not just about the Arabs it's about all people that are uneducated the Quran by the way has a hint towards that if if we think ummiyyeen are just the Arabs then Allah wouldn't have said about the Israelites who are not Arabs he said about them so which means the ummiyyeen are not just Arabs they're among them too and this this opinion has also been criticized historically because the non-arabs were not unlettered they were not uneducated the Chinese were in advanced civilization the Persians were in advanced civilization the Romans were in advanced civilization how can you call them ummiyyeen I would argue against this criticism and say this does not mean they didn't know engineering and they didn't know how to build roads and highways and giant buildings and monuments this means they didn't have knowledge of Allah's revelation that's what makes them ummiyyeen you can have a phd nowadays in engineering and you can be very educated in the worldly sense and still be what from a spiritual perspective you could still be an ummi you don't know much about the book right and those people have some things in common like Allah says people like that they don't know the book itself except they just have some wishes some hopes and then they have to build their religion on assumptions they assume what they heard is true and they don't have any direct knowledge right that's the that's the state of the ummiyyeen another opinion is because ummi comes from umma that this just means they come from different nations they just they just belong to different nations it's not talking about them not reading and writing there's a narration from different hadith sources Ab\u016b H\u016br\u012bl\u0101z\u012b says we were sitting with the Prophet \ufdfa when Surat al-Jumu'ah came down so they were sitting together and the Prophet received this surah and he started reciting it so he read it because the ayah said that the Sahabah are listening and the Prophet recites these words that we're studying now one of the men said to the Prophet \ufdfa who are these people who haven't joined us now so who are these people that haven't joined us when so he was curious so the Prophet \ufdfa put his hand on Salman al-F\u0101r\u012bs\u012b Salman al-F\u0101r\u012bs\u012b is from where it's from Persia right so it's from Persia okay had faith was a treasure that was hiding in the Pilates constellation in the sky constellation in the sky called Pilates so the Arabs were really big on the stars some of you that may have heard my Surat al-Najm series in Ramadan may have noticed the Arabs talked a lot about the stars so this hadith is referring to the Pilates constellation and at night the Arabs were very keen on that particular constellation so if im\u0101 and if faith was all the way to Thorayah people like this this kind of person these kinds of people would have reached that too what he's saying is look at the journeys he took to find im\u0101 and if you study the story of Salman al-F\u0101r\u012bs\u012b you'll know the kind of incredible journey he took to find this message right and the religious turns he took and the the turmoil he went through traversing the world to try to find the final Prophet \ufdfa and to find his im\u0101 so he's saying these people would have found faith no matter what so he indicated according to this towards Persia so he highlighted Persia and it's clear that they're not ummiy\u012bn of the Arabs they're a different kind of ummiy\u012bn right now a lot of scholars when they discussed this they talked about oh this this means because of this hadith the ummiy\u012bn means the Persians right the ummiy\u012bn means the I would argue against that also I would argue the Prophet \ufdfa a lot of times to teach a lesson he gives an example so what's a good example for you to understand who are these other people what's the easiest example right there in the room the soba al-F\u0101r\u012bs\u012b you see this these kinds of people that doesn't mean oh the Persians only no what it means is if this if this one came from the other side so so much beyond the Arab territories how many more are there Allah didn't specify and that's why so so when Allah speaks in general terms he means general terms so it's actually referring to all nations and the Persians are a specific category of them interestingly one of the things that's that's got me really curious recently is just particularly Persia and the history of Persia the Farsi language and Islam Farsi arguably has as much if not more Islamic literature in history than Arabic and the scholars from around the world actually were producing their works in Arabic and many of them were producing their works in in Farsi and even nowadays because you know because of the Sunni Shi'a divide we think that when we think of Farsi we think of Shi'a literature or something like that that is not the case historically at all actually the vast majority there's huge volumes of literature that Muslims were were consuming the Seer works Hadith works Vik works that were actually in in Farsi okay and there's a big big part of the and it didn't just come from Iran is the crazy thing it was coming from all over the world and this became a part of the Muslim heritage so the Muslim heritage is actually very multilingual one of the curiosities I have in my own studies of the Quran I like to understand intellectual history also in other words I know now because I come from the Indian Pakistani subcontinent background the people there have a certain kind of thinking they have a certain kind of history they have they come from a history of philosophy of music and poetry and they have that kind of and spirituality mysticism you know they have that history and that impacted the way they looked at the Quran and they saw things in the Quran that other other nations didn't see so they commented in a different way the Persians have their own history of poetry and philosophy their own heritage and they were they were linguists also they're very keen on language they were grammarians so when they come to the Quran they saw something their interpretations of the Quran brought something new to the table and so the same way the Andalusian scholars that were in Spain and the same way the African scholarship and the same way you know scholarship for out from around the world because they have their own heritage and culture then they're learning the Quran they're actually seeing things from different angles too and they're bringing something more to the table right because they come from that heritage I'll give you one example of that guys sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture just before you continue I want to let you know and encourage you that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com and help other sign up or even sponsor students for bayinatv.com so we can create worldwide communities of students that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran and are inshallah Ota'ala spreading that in their own circles thanks so much I'll give you one example of that when you study when I studied the Arab tafasir right and the the tafasir that come from Arab lands predominantly the one thing you will notice more than anything else is there's a lot of focus on the word on every word there's a lot of focus right and it's in if you guys are university students it's like micro studies yeah it's micro studies and then when you start studying some Persian literature or some Urdu literature some subcontinental literature you'll notice there's a lot of focus on the bigger picture they're saying okay what about this whole surah where are we getting from the whole surah what about the whole page what about these entire like they're they're zooming out what's that called it's macro studies right it's it's there's a macro perspective there's a micro perspective and there's a macro perspective and the the analogy I like to give is if you are a photographer and you're flying with a helicopter over a valley and you take a really beautiful photo of the valley does that have value yeah of course you captured a gorgeous scene but the helicopter lands and you zoom in on one flower and one petal of that one flower and a bee sitting on that one petal of that one flower and you take a picture does that have value also is that artistic also yeah it's the same it's the same camera it's the same location but you can zoom in and you can zoom out and each one of them has an advantage but each one of them has a disadvantage if you zoom out you miss the smaller details and if you zoom in you miss the bigger picture and what's amazing about this umma is that Allah did not restricts this umma's intellectual heritage to one culture so all these different cultures with their own kind of you know like Germans are notoriously scientific in their thinking and mathematical in their thinking right so imagine German scholarship on Islam right German scholarship on Islam I know I know there's a lot of non-muslim German scholarship on Islam I know that's existed for a couple of centuries actually I've read some of it too in translation I mean do you remember German um but uh there's French scholarship on Islam there's Spanish scholarship on Islam there's and I'm curious about you know different cultures scholarship on Islam and what they brought to the table what they saw that other people just don't they don't have that lens so they can't see it right and this is one of the great gifts that Allah gave to our religion you know you might be fascinated to know this Allah said ahadin all others will join them you think others okay so few more will join actually the majority of the umma is Arabs the minority is Arabs the vast majority of the umma is actually non-Arabs and that happened very early on extremely early on they're the nucleus but that it just spread and kept on spreading and spreading and spreading the analogy of Islam is like a seed right you plant a seed a tree grows but the tree has lots of fruits that those fruits have seeds those seeds spread and it just and it spread like almost like pollen that's how it spread and I actually Allah gave the analogy of la idaha idvallah as a tree you know you know the example of the tree the roots are deep and the branches go into the sky and that analogy is pretty amazing because actually that's kind of what happened in the world with Islam you know we traveled like the wind we traveled everywhere and we just spread and spread and spread so I I say this not just because it's a cool observation I have a request from all of you you're all many of you are from different heritage different backgrounds right and when you you know you you modernize and you you know the world moves forward and we have to learn the language in which we can get a job and we can we have to learn the language of the university a lot of times the younger generation loses the mother language right so for example I speak Urdu but then I was most of my adult life I was in in the United States so I didn't speak Urdu much right and then I started losing touch with Urdu and the only when I started getting back into Islam I said okay I'm gonna read the Arabic if I see but I'm also gonna read Urdu literature so at least I have two civilizations I have access to right so I started reading Urdu materials a lot too so that kept me in touch with Urdu but while living in New York and living in Texas I'm keeping in touch with my Urdu then after 30 years I went back to Pakistan 29 years to be exact so I haven't been back for 29 years I go back and I start speaking and a young man came to me and said you speak old people Urdu he literally said you speak Nawabi Urdu and I was like huh and the reason he said that is because in those 30 years what happened to the Urdu language it deteriorated it actually declined and so the amazing literature in Urdu that your grandmother could appreciate or even I could appreciate I'd say like a grandma now but yes now the next generation has less contact with it you you understand I think it's as important learning the Arabic language is number one but alongside it whatever heritage you come from you should master that language you shouldn't just speak it to just casually hang out you should actually know its heritage its legacy especially if you're lucky enough to know something about Farsi or you know the languages in which Muslims have a heritage Muslims have a history if if Muslims have been in the region for a couple of hundred years or more then there's a scholarly history in that literature in that in those works and you can bring that out you can expose that to the rest of the world you know to the rest of the umma so they may be able to benefit anyway so the aakhirin amin hum lammayal haqoobihim they haven't yet joined them lammayal just this is a small grammar note manfiyu ha mus'tamir ilal hal this is a word and it means negative but negative up until now wa yutawakka'u wukooruhu ba'dahu and it's expected that it will happen right after so just like you say hey it has it has it's not come yet not yet there's an expectation that he's coming right so Allah has set the expectation that more Muslims are now coming that are not from among the Arabs this is about to get bigger and bigger and bigger okay this is really cool also al al-yalhaqoobihim alhaqoobihim is joined is translated as they haven't joined them yet that's how he translated it they haven't joined them yet but al-ahik bin al-thimar is actually this word is used for fruits that come on the same tree one season after another season after another season so the you know the next season's fruit the next season's fruit that's called al-ahik min al-thimar which is really awesome because now we're being described as new fruits from the same tree right so the tree starts with the sahaba it's the same tree and then newer and newer fruits are emerging with every season and we're just another season of those fruits but the tree we belong to the same exact tree it's such a beautiful connection to our history to these people that Allah has made you know nations they pride themselves on their own history right and now because of after colonialism there's a lot of you know because we're all nation states now right so you know you have a region where they're all geographically actually very close to each other culturally they're close to each other language wise they're close to each other but the the British or the French or the you know the day not the Danes but the Dutch or whoever they'll come and draw a line and say okay you guys are Malaysian you guys are Indonesian okay you guys are Pakistan you guys are India you guys are Bangladesh you guys are Sri Lanka you guys they'll draw these lines right and it's been it hasn't even been a hundred years since those lines but people now identify themselves inside these lines right and then there's national pride and your flag and if there's a sport if there's a match going on and everybody's waving their flag you know that kind of thing but what Allah did is so remarkable that he actually joined us to people that we don't have any genetic connection to we don't even have a geographical connection to them we're not even from the same region the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam is in hijaz and the Indonesian is on the other side of the world and they're connected and they're bonded together and that bond is thicker than blood it's thicker than blood and you know like the the the tree that gives a fruit right the fruit is almost identical from the previous year's fruits it's the same it's not a different fruit it's the same fruit it's a new manifestation of the fruit the only time the fruit goes bad is if there's not enough water not enough sun something went bad right but the potential to produce amazing fruit is always there isn't it so the idea inside this analogy is also that as generations go by it's not like oh Muslims are just going to be a inferior product the good ones are all dead and the new ones are you know the all the amazing Muslims died and us losers are the only ones left you know this kind of mentality is also problematic because Allah has acknowledged those who will be coming and joining them and he did not make them feel make them seem inferior right or the other and I've said this in previous lectures but it's important to note the Arabic language is such a deep part of the of Arab culture just like or do or Farsi or Bahasa or you know Swahili or Senegalese are part of their own culture but Arabic Allah took it from the Arabs and he said you can't keep it for yourself you can have it but I'm gonna make this the language of the entire Oma they're all gonna have it they're all gonna share it so you don't have to be Arab to be Arab you just have to know Arabic in the Arab listen Arabs are just a tongue that's all it is no other language oh once you speak it you're that person not really you can speak German you can act German but you're not German you know like it was pretty funny I was one time I was in back in the day I was in New York I was taking a walk it was a big it's a big Russian neighborhood and I clearly don't look Russian and this guy and he didn't even speak English properly he's a Russian dude but he's just steady he can't stand that I'm walking by this Russian neighbor he goes go back to your country let's go together okay now we have to this this idea of others joining we have to learn something about Jewish studies Hebrew studies that is going to help us gain some perspective about this Ia I told you that in this Surah the word Quddus right the word Yuzaki him there are other implications that this is actually there's a secondary audience which is some some some of the factions of the rabbis right not all of them but some of them so we're gonna read some things from some rabbinic attitudes towards Gentiles and the Goyim this is courtesy of Dr. Sakit Hossain who's a dear friend and colleague of mine who's finished his PhD out of Oxford in biblical studies Alhamdulillah he's a scholar of the Quran and he's also has mastered the Hebrew language and has studied the Torah and Jewish scholarship pretty extensively and writes about the correlation between the two so I and he's on my WhatsApp so I can flex that so I just say hey bro I gotta give can you give me a non-phd version because I gotta talk to humans so then he'll just send me like so this is from WhatsApp messages is the the truth okay the source and concerning bloodshed in what matters is the so this is about this is their fatawa on killing in their literature a non-ju against a non-ju and a non-ju against a ju is liable a ju against a non-ju is exempt meaning if a member of the Israelites kills a non-ju it's not a crime they're exempt okay and concerning theft in in what matter is the transgressors capable in case of kidnapper a thief the one who seizes a beautiful war captive you see where that's going and the like a non-ju against a non-ju and a non-ju against a ju is prohibited a ju against a non-ju is permitted so there was this idea that these people you can do anything you want with them in some of their groups not all of them but some of them developed this idea that us the believers they saw themselves as the believers we can do anything with these kufar they're basically less than human right which should sound scarily familiar because there are some muslims you if if i just change the words muslim and non-muslim is from ju lanju you would think this is some some muslims that are saying this nowadays right this the source of it is the tosefta it's one of the earliest rabbinic texts along with the mishnah this was written around 200 bc the the source the chapter is called bodh azadah which means outsider worship which is a chapter within it okay let's keep going why are the gentiles impure meaning why are non-ju is impure uh in their in their mind why are the kufar impure okay some rabbinic writings several classical jewish reports give the view that the serpent who tempted even the garden actually copulated with her that's weird but yes that's actually their interpretation which is why humanity is tainted by sin this is similar to the christian idea of original sin but then israel is standing at mount syni Israel in standing at mount syni had their filth cease non-jews who did not stand at the mount syni did not have their filth cease when they stood at mount syni i told you the account that the Quran describes the conversation this is their version of that conversation their version among some of them the conversation is when they stood at mount syni they were forever purified and everybody else they're not just their filth did not end actually they believe human beings are born filthy because the children of adam are actually how what it was not with adam how what was with the serpent that's what they're basically saying so this is their the jewish version in some rabbinic traditions of original sin we don't believe in original sin they have that concept right the general rule in early Judaism was that the categories of pure and not pure did not apply to jews by the time you get to the Talmud which is completed around the sixth century there is much harsher view in which Gentiles are considered impure uh so and this is some more details we don't have to get into the details but let's go back to why i brought all of this up Allah says ummiyyin is basically their equivalent of non-jews Gentiles which they by definition consider what what do they consider them impure he says he raised among the impure and from their perspective and then what does he say about them he purifies them what you say key him you see what's happening here their view was what so long as you're under the mountain you are purified unless saying no the only thing that will purify you is the word of Allah and this messenger is coming to the ummiyyin and he's purifying them and in this next slide that we're studying now and by the way the only people who can access the Torah and access the word of God are the most pure people but now these ummiyyin that are supposedly impure not only are they getting purified now that he's going to teach them the the Quran the book he's gonna teach them the book the purest of all scriptures he's gonna teach them that so now there's a shift in the definition of purity purity is not coming from a certain race like in certain classes of hinduism certain races certain classes of people are pure people and certain others are then it right they're the untouchables they are the the the lower classes this didn't just happen in in in one civilization there are many uh in korea in china in india there are many class societies where if you're born into a certain kind of class you will remain in that class you cannot come out of that class you are you are born into impurity you're born into it and you have to escape it somehow right and the the christians even adopted it as a doctrine all human beings are born into sin they're born dirty they're born impure and only through the blood of jesus can they be purified and quran comes along it says no no no no hold on this is all made up the truth is every human being is born pure fitlidallah that the fatala nasa adiha and the corruption comes at the hands of people you weren't designed impure you were designed pure it's a it's a fundamentally different definition than what you're getting in other religious traditions and by the way it those of you that are students of psychology this is an interesting small fact if you believe human beings are fundamentally impure born into sin lower class whatever you're born into sin then you are from the beginning broken you're broken from the beginning and you just have to spend your life identifying how you can undo the damage that's un inevitable you're already damaged right and when you study Freudian psychology which is the father of modern psychology right you will notice that that the definition of human beings they're bored they're born with certain essentially psychological defects we're all basically disturbed subconsciously and i won't spell out how we're disturbed if you're going to study Freud you'll know for yourself and then it's manifesting further down the road as now in you know pop psychology pop psychology means anybody on twitter becomes a therapist you know let me tell you how to deal with your emotions right everybody's a counselor everybody's a therapist everybody's licensed to i love life coaches i love these guys are amazing like certified certified life coach the the the the most entertaining ones are the muslim ones certified good believer that and what's there you know how people put reviews underneath the review is this is a really good person it's like oh okay but the idea in all of these kinds of brands of therapy and i'm actually a very eager student of psychology and i appreciate the science is that oh you were probably traumatized by this or that or the other and you're still dealing with your trauma and you haven't healed and you're just going to spend your life undoing the effects of the trauma and everybody walks out of therapy like yep i'm a traumatized victim i'm i'm just i'm just trauma walking around and then you go you go somewhere you go to your coffee place and the guy takes two extra minutes to bring your coffee i'm traumatized by this late delivery and i got triggered and you're just you're just living in trauma right but the the the quran's argument actually is that you were born pure and then dirt came on and then when revelation comes the dirt comes off again you's a key him where you are leaving the book about what hit about profound difference okay now why is this important that means all nations are now equally blessed there's no more one blessed ethnicity the you know the the the all the african nations are blessed all the australians are blessed the aborigines are blessed the native americans are blessed the europeans are blessed there's no better or worse nation they're all now equal because akharid i'm in home covers everybody all nations are now an extension of the ummeyin which means the ummeyin didn't know any better and they could be purified you could have been living in a society where there's thousands of years of shit doesn't matter you can be purified too you're just just like them and purity is no longer about a special class or a lineage you're not born royal you're not born special everyone's born special and purity is about what you do with your life after that okay so now this this was just a few things about that ayah well i'm in home let me have hope will be him i will just add one more thing as we as we start this second this next ayah which is that you know Allah made us an umma that could not distinguish between which race we come from and yet at the same time Allah says he made you into nations and tribes so you can get to know each other and there's an interesting tidbit there about shuroban shuroban arabic shab means people in modern arabic shab means people but shab in old arabic actually used to mean a hole in the wall sometimes you have a wall it's got a little crack in it or a hole in it and what do you have to do you have to fill it up right shab are called people but not perfect people they have a hole they have some kind of crack and some other shab have a different kind of crack and some other shab have a different kind of crack and when you meet other people you're like i can learn something from you that i can fill my gap my crack with there's a crack in my wall that i can fix by learning from you and you can learn something for me that can fix the crack in your wall so when when believers have cultural exchange they learn from each other they actually better each other and Allah designed this system of just a a bunch of nations that have many strengths and some weaknesses and somebody's weakness is somebody else's what strength and it's just this thing of beauty Allah created right which is kind of what i was saying even in our intellectual histories in it there's a micro view but the micro view has one disadvantage that you don't get the macro picture so there's these are one shab they have this kind of view not another shab have that kind of view you know you were able to merge between the two of them shawab and the tribes that you know Salamu Alaikum everyone there are almost 50,000 students around the world that are interested on top of the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends and they need sponsorships which is not very expensive so if you can help sponsor students on bayna tv please do so and visit our sponsorship page i appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it the world over", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.24, "text": " Because usually, when you're trying to convert people to a new
