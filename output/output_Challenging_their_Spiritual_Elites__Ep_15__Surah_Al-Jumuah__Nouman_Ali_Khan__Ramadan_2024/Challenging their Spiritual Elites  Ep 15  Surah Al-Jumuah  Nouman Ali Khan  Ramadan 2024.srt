1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Because usually, when you're trying to convert people to a new religion,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,120
you're trying to get the least knowledgeable people

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,920
because they're easier to convert.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,480
So you might go into the villages where the very poor people are,

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,840
give them some food,

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,440
and then invite them to your little religious gathering and easy to convert.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,840
Which is by the way, some religions do that nowadays too.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,560
Right?

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,560
But they won't go to the cultural capitals or the learning capitals.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,360
They're not going to go to the universities, you see?

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,680
This is one of the things that makes Islam unique.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,840
The Quran wasn't challenging the people who know the least of the other religion.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,520
The Quran was inviting the people who know the most of the other religion.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,800
Alhamdulillah.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,080
Everyone once again, day four.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,440
We move on from the two core ayaat of the surah,

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,440
the first two ayaat of the surah now.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,120
And the third ayaat of this surah is actually grammatically connected to the second ayaat.

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,720
So this happens in the Quran where you may have multiple ayaas,

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
but actually there's still one sentence.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,760
Right?

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,000
The easiest example of that is Alhamdulillah,

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,120
Maniki and Mindin is actually one sentence.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,400
Grammatically it's one sentence.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,880
Similarly,

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,760
is actually one sentence.

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,440
It's not multiple sentences.

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,720
So there are multiple ayaat, but there's still just one sentence.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,200
So the same thing happens here is actually from the previous ayaa.

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,840
You notice, grammar students will notice the first word here is

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,520
which is not in the rafa form.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,400
It's not aaharun.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,200
Had it been aaharun, you could argue that this

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,240
is a new sentence.

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,920
But because it's monsoob, the nusb condition of it is impacted by something that came before.

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,560
And this might sound alien to some of you that haven't studied a little bit of Arabic grammar

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,320
or Arabic studies.

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,400
And my intention is also to make you curious about how do you figure that stuff out.

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,520
It's really not that hard.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,640
And inshallah you'll get there.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,040
By the end of the program, I'll show you a pathway you can take to get there,

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
inshallah, on your own.

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,160
Anyway, so wa ahadinaminhum, a rough translation.

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,240
Then we'll get into the dafsir matters.

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,360
And there are others.

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,440
And then there's the complicated phrase, others from them.

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,560
There are yet others from them.

48
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,880
Now, what does that mean?

49
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,120
There are more people other than the book, you know, the ones that he purified,

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,800
the ones that he read the ayaat to, the ones that he teaches the law and the book,

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,880
the law and the wisdom to, right?

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,120
There are yet and those are the ummiyeen.

53
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Yet there are others from them.

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,960
Or

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,000
لما يلحقوا بههم that have not yet joined them.

56
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
They haven't joined them yet.

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,440
What does that mean?

58
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,160
They're about to.

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,480
What is with عزيز with حكيم?

60
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,040
And he is the ultimate authority and all wives.

61
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,360
That's the rough translation of the ayaat.

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,440
We're going to start with some commentary today.

63
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,880
I'm going to read some things to you that I think you should be exposed to.

64
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,040
And here's just some insights from different scholars like

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,920
ابن عاشور رحمه الله in his التحريب التنويل.

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:35,120
This is an unseen prediction.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,200
Meaning the Quran has given a prediction of the future to the Prophet

68
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,360
صلى الله عليه وسلم that this message and this invitation of the

69
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,520
Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is going to reach other nations that are not Arab.

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,720
فارس والأرمن والأكراد والبربر والسودان.

71
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,640
You can tell these are different names of nations right?

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,800
والروم والتورك والتطار والمهول والصين.

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,200
Anyone know what is China?

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
China والهنوط.

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,800
Anyone know what is this?

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,920
The Indians the Tatars the Persians the the the the Armenians the

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,360
Barbar the Sudanese the Romans the Turks the Tatars then وغيرهم

78
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,320
and even beyond them وهاذة من معجزات القرآن من سنف الأخبار بالمغيبات

79
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,400
and this is part of the miracles of the Quran.

80
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,640
One of the miracles of the Quran that Allah told the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم

81
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,560
of how international this religion is going to be others

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
beyond them are going to be joining that haven't joined them yet.

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,560
وفي الآية دلالة على عمومي رسالة ابن بي صلى الله عليه وسلم

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,800
يجمير الأمم and in this ayah there is evidence this serves as an evidence of how universal

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
the prophethood of our prophet is صلى الله عليه وسلم for all nations.

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,080
You see so far Allah has sent prophets up until Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,280
Allah sent prophets to particular nations right?

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,560
Messengers came to particular nations with a mission and they weren't sent to all of humanity

89
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,040
like they have to be concerned with all of humanity.

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,520
The closest to that you get in the history of the world is Ibrahim

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,360
عليه السلام but even he wasn't sent to all nations he was concerned for all nations

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,960
there's a difference right?

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,360
And he made a dua for all nations and he wanted to help all nations

94
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,560
but he wasn't sent as a mission to all nations but our messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم

95
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,640
his mission began with the region in which he was born and raised

96
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,600
رسولة منهم فيهم رسولة منهم we saw that

97
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,520
but then even before his life came to an end in this world

98
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,440
then he already instructed how the mission is supposed to now become beyond the borders of

99
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,720
the Arabs right?

100
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,120
So Islam starts spreading outside of that hijaz region outside of that desert even within

101
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,360
his own lifetime he's engaging with outside territories and this was part of the plan of

102
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,080
Allah and he's hinting at that plan inside

103
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,920
وَاَاَصْلَيْنَا مِنْهُمْ لَمْمَا يَلْحَقُوبِهِمْ فَهُوَنْ عَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمِ

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,400
Okay so now we're going to rediscuss something because this is connected to the previous

105
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,560
ayah we're going to rediscuss the concept of al-ummiyeen so far I told you these are

106
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,320
the unlettered uneducated people people that didn't have knowledge of the scripture

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,160
we're going to read some more things about them

108
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,680
وَاَصْلَجَ الْبُقَارِيْ وَاَمْسْلِمْ وَاَبُدَاوُدْ وَالْنِسَائِيْ عَنِبْنِ عُمرَ عَنِنَّ بِيْصَظَ اللَّهُمْ عَلِيْسَلَمْ قَالَ

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,360
This is a narration of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is found in Bukhari and in Muslim

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,840
and this is Imam al-Aloosi al-Ruh al-Ma'ani quoting this I'll translate it for you

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,480
اِنَّ أُمَّةٌ أُمْمِيَةٌ لَا نَكْتُبُوا وَدَا نَحْسُبُوا

112
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,440
We are an ummah that is ummiya meaning the same word ummiyun we are a nation that is ummi

113
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,600
which means we don't write and we don't do calculations in other words we don't have

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,320
you know universities and we don't have these you know philosophical libraries and all that kind

115
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,440
of stuff we don't have that intellectual heritage of learning and learning institutions like the

116
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,080
Greeks had or some other civilizations had right so we're not those people but

117
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,640
and what is intended by that is that they are as though they just came out of their moms I mentioned

118
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,480
that to you before right uh

119
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,960
لم يتعلم الكتابة والحصاب they didn't learn advanced mathematics or writing

120
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,440
فهم على جبالتيهم الأولى they are on their original essential nature

121
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
فَالُمِّي نِسبَةٌ إِلَا الْأُمْ الَّتِيْ وَدَدَتُهُ

122
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,040
So ummi is associated with um so the e the e parted ummiyun the the extra y that you hear

123
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,760
that's called the yah ad nisbah and we use that in many cultures it came from the Arabs and a bunch

124
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,400
of us just kind of in different languages copied it so if you're from Pakistan you're what

125
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,400
Pakistani right if you're from Iran what are you

126
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,040
Iranian if you're from Afghanistan you're what

127
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:01,120
Avlani right so yeah be um so lots of languages took on this e as an adjective

128
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,800
so Afghanistan is a place but Avlani is an adjective right or hind is a place but hindi is

129
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,400
an adjective right so the same way there's the word umma and how do you make umma an adjective

130
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,560
ummi that's called yah ad nisbah so that's the yah ad nisbah here nisbah

131
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,360
اِلَا الْأُمْ الَّتِيْ وَدَتُهُ so it's attributing it to the the the one so

132
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,160
Avlani is the one of Afghanistan the one tied to Afghanistan ummi is the one tied to the mother

133
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,120
in that sense you see so that's that's where the meaning comes from what this button

134
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,600
اِلَا اُمْمَةِ العَرَبْ and it's also been said that this is referring to the the

135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,040
nation of the Arabs meaning ummiyoon the people that belong to the Arab nation umma

136
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,600
وَقِلَا إِلَا اُمْمِ الْقُرَى that it's referring to the the nations or the the capital

137
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,160
of the nations because the ummiyoon may refer to the people of Makkah let me explain that really

138
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,520
quickly why why could that refer to the people of Makkah that you know the capital city in any

139
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,280
country we call it the capital uh the Arabs would call it the mother of all the cities

140
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,520
that's the mother city okay so ummul qurah so ummul qurah ummul qurah is one of the names of Makkah

141
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,280
okay why because it's the capital in a sense the cultural and economic capital of the region

142
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,480
right and the religious capital of the region so it's the um of all the other towns it's the

143
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,280
mother of all the other towns and that's that name is used in the Quran to describe Makkah

144
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,520
so actually Allah even describes that he sent messengers many times to different ummul qurah

145
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,960
meaning he sent them to cultural capitals because if you if you spread the message of Islam for

146
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,360
example Musa A.S. was sent in the cultural capital of Egypt right right at the palace of the Pharaoh

147
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,640
because if you impact there it will have impact everywhere and which is also true when you have

148
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,840
you know the cultural capitals have influence and if you can have if you can make it there then you

149
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,080
will your message will spread far and wide right so influencing Makkah or winning over Makkah will

150
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,760
not just have impact over Makkah it will have impact over all the regions and perhaps in this

151
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,120
there's also an indication that Islam wasn't just going to go into small villages and on the

152
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,880
peripheries Islam was going to go into the capitals of every civilization you know it was going to

153
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,080
go to the capitals of Europe the capitals of Africa the capitals of Asia and it was going to go to

154
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,960
the centers of society the centers of learning and have an impact there at the top because usually

155
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,840
when you're trying to convert people to a new religion you're trying to get the least knowledgeable

156
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,200
people because they're easier to convert so you might go into the villages where the very poor

157
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,240
people are give them some food and then invite them to your little religious gathering and easy

158
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,280
to convert which is by the way some religions do that nowadays too right but they won't go to the

159
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,440
cultural capitals or the learning capitals they're not going to go to the universities you see this

160
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
is one of the things that makes Islam unique the Quran wasn't challenging the people who know the

161
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,120
least of the other religion the Quran was inviting the people who know the most of the other religion

162
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,600
it was reverse engineering this entire proselytizing process i'll read something more to you

163
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,520
so this became a tough seer discussion among scholars does ummiyyeen refer only to the Arabs

164
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,240
because they were of course for for thousands of years they didn't have any learning or religion or

165
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,760
you know profits coming to them in that way so are they the ones that it's meant

166
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:46,640
so it has also been said that any people who did not have previous knowledge of the scripture or

167
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,440
they did not know about this final scripture they can be considered ummi too meaning al-ajab

168
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:59,200
meaning the non-arab also also he had that interpretation that ummiyyeen is not just

169
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,160
about the Arabs it's about all people that are uneducated the Quran by the way has a hint

170
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,520
towards that if if we think ummiyyeen are just the Arabs then Allah wouldn't have said about the

171
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Israelites who are not Arabs he said about them

172
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,560
so which means the ummiyyeen are not just Arabs they're among them too

173
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,800
and this this opinion has also been criticized historically because the non-arabs were not

174
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,440
unlettered they were not uneducated the Chinese were in advanced civilization the Persians were

175
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,760
in advanced civilization the Romans were in advanced civilization how can you call them ummiyyeen

176
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,040
I would argue against this criticism and say this does not mean they didn't know engineering and

177
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,280
they didn't know how to build roads and highways and giant buildings and monuments this means they

178
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,720
didn't have knowledge of Allah's revelation that's what makes them ummiyyeen you can have a phd

179
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,400
nowadays in engineering and you can be very educated in the worldly sense and still be what from

180
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,800
a spiritual perspective you could still be an ummi you don't know much about the book right

181
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,920
and those people have some things in common like Allah says people like that they don't know the

182
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,360
book itself except they just have some wishes some hopes and then they have to build their religion

183
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,680
on assumptions they assume what they heard is true and they don't have any direct knowledge right

184
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,680
that's the that's the state of the ummiyyeen

185
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,960
another opinion is because ummi comes from umma that this just means they come from different

186
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,840
nations they just they just belong to different nations it's not talking about them not reading

187
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:52,000
and writing there's a narration from different hadith sources

188
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Abū Hūrīlāzī says

189
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,400
we were sitting with the Prophet ﷺ when Surat al-Jumu'ah came down so they were sitting together

190
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,120
and the Prophet received this surah and he started reciting it so he read it

191
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,360
because the ayah said that the Sahabah are listening and the Prophet recites these words

192
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
that we're studying now

193
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
one of the men said to the Prophet ﷺ

194
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,600
who are these people who haven't joined us

195
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,520
now so who are these people that haven't joined us when so he was curious

196
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,080
so the Prophet ﷺ put his hand on Salman al-Fārīsī

197
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,360
Salman al-Fārīsī is from where

198
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
it's from Persia right so it's from Persia

199
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
okay

200
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,080
had faith was a treasure that was hiding in the Pilates constellation in the sky

201
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,520
constellation in the sky called Pilates

202
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,720
so the Arabs were really big on the stars

203
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,360
some of you that may have heard my Surat al-Najm series in Ramadan

204
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
may have noticed the Arabs talked a lot about the stars

205
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,680
so this hadith is referring to the Pilates constellation

206
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,280
and at night the Arabs were very keen on that particular constellation

207
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,960
so if imā and if faith was all the way to Thorayah

208
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,800
people like this this kind of person these kinds of people would have reached that too

209
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,440
what he's saying is look at the journeys he took to find imā

210
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,840
and if you study the story of Salman al-Fārīsī

211
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,400
you'll know the kind of incredible journey he took to find this message

212
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,680
right and the religious turns he took and the the turmoil he went through

213
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,360
traversing the world to try to find the final Prophet ﷺ

214
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,240
and to find his imā

215
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
so he's saying these people would have found faith no matter what

216
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:12,000
so he indicated according to this towards Persia

217
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
so he highlighted Persia

218
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,920
and it's clear that they're not ummiyīn of the Arabs

219
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,080
they're a different kind of ummiyīn

220
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,920
right now a lot of scholars when they discussed this they talked about

221
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,600
oh this this means because of this hadith the ummiyīn means the Persians

222
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,760
right the ummiyīn means the I would argue against that also

223
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,040
I would argue the Prophet ﷺ a lot of times to teach a lesson he gives an example

224
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,560
so what's a good example for you to understand who are these other people

225
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,800
what's the easiest example right there in the room

226
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,800
the soba al-Fārīsī you see this these kinds of people that doesn't mean oh the Persians only

227
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,200
no what it means is if this if this one came from the other side

228
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,080
so so much beyond the Arab territories how many more are there Allah didn't specify

229
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
and that's why so so

230
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:13,680
when Allah speaks in general terms he means general terms so it's actually referring to all nations

231
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,640
and the Persians are a specific category of them interestingly one of the things that's that's

232
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,680
got me really curious recently is just particularly Persia and the history of Persia the Farsi language

233
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:34,800
and Islam Farsi arguably has as much if not more Islamic literature in history than Arabic

234
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,400
and the scholars from around the world actually were producing their works in Arabic

235
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,400
and many of them were producing their works in in Farsi and even nowadays because you know because

236
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,480
of the Sunni Shi'a divide we think that when we think of Farsi we think of Shi'a literature or

237
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,600
something like that that is not the case historically at all actually the vast majority there's huge

238
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,480
volumes of literature that Muslims were were consuming the Seer works Hadith works Vik works

239
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,720
that were actually in in Farsi okay and there's a big big part of the and it didn't just come from

240
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,480
Iran is the crazy thing it was coming from all over the world and this became a part of the

241
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,320
Muslim heritage so the Muslim heritage is actually very multilingual one of the curiosities

242
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,920
I have in my own studies of the Quran I like to understand intellectual history also in other

243
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,560
words I know now because I come from the Indian Pakistani subcontinent background the people

244
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,840
there have a certain kind of thinking they have a certain kind of history they have they come from

245
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,960
a history of philosophy of music and poetry and they have that kind of and spirituality mysticism

246
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,400
you know they have that history and that impacted the way they looked at the Quran and they saw

247
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,560
things in the Quran that other other nations didn't see so they commented in a different way the Persians

248
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,200
have their own history of poetry and philosophy their own heritage and they were they were linguists

249
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,480
also they're very keen on language they were grammarians so when they come to the Quran they saw

250
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,120
something their interpretations of the Quran brought something new to the table and so the same

251
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,720
way the Andalusian scholars that were in Spain and the same way the African scholarship and the

252
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,520
same way you know scholarship for out from around the world because they have their own heritage and

253
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,960
culture then they're learning the Quran they're actually seeing things from different angles too

254
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,600
and they're bringing something more to the table right because they come from that heritage I'll

255
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,160
give you one example of that guys sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture

256
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,240
just before you continue I want to let you know and encourage you that I want you to sign up for

257
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,760
bayinatv.com and help other sign up or even sponsor students for bayinatv.com so we can create

258
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,840
worldwide communities of students that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the

259
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,880
Quran and are inshallah Ota'ala spreading that in their own circles thanks so much I'll give you

260
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,280
one example of that when you study when I studied the Arab tafasir right and the the tafasir that

261
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,880
come from Arab lands predominantly the one thing you will notice more than anything else is there's

262
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,200
a lot of focus on the word on every word there's a lot of focus right and it's in if you guys are

263
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,280
university students it's like micro studies yeah it's micro studies and then when you start studying

264
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,840
some Persian literature or some Urdu literature some subcontinental literature you'll notice

265
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,200
there's a lot of focus on the bigger picture they're saying okay what about this whole surah

266
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,640
where are we getting from the whole surah what about the whole page what about these

267
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,720
entire like they're they're zooming out what's that called it's macro studies right it's it's

268
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,360
there's a macro perspective there's a micro perspective and there's a macro perspective

269
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,200
and the the analogy I like to give is if you are a photographer and you're flying with a helicopter

270
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,560
over a valley and you take a really beautiful photo of the valley does that have value yeah of

271
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,400
course you captured a gorgeous scene but the helicopter lands and you zoom in on one flower

272
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,880
and one petal of that one flower and a bee sitting on that one petal of that one flower

273
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,600
and you take a picture does that have value also is that artistic also yeah it's the same

274
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,760
it's the same camera it's the same location but you can zoom in and you can zoom out and each one

275
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,960
of them has an advantage but each one of them has a disadvantage if you zoom out you miss the smaller

276
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,440
details and if you zoom in you miss the bigger picture and what's amazing about this umma is

277
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:41,040
that Allah did not restricts this umma's intellectual heritage to one culture so all these different

278
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,120
cultures with their own kind of you know like Germans are notoriously scientific in their thinking

279
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:55,360
and mathematical in their thinking right so imagine German scholarship on Islam right German

280
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,240
scholarship on Islam I know I know there's a lot of non-muslim German scholarship on Islam I know

281
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,800
that's existed for a couple of centuries actually I've read some of it too in translation I mean

282
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,520
do you remember German um but uh there's French scholarship on Islam there's Spanish scholarship

283
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,000
on Islam there's and I'm curious about you know different cultures scholarship on Islam and what

284
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,480
they brought to the table what they saw that other people just don't they don't have that lens so they

285
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,600
can't see it right and this is one of the great gifts that Allah gave to our religion you know you

286
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,560
might be fascinated to know this Allah said ahadin all others will join them you think others okay so

287
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:41,920
few more will join actually the majority of the umma is Arabs the minority is Arabs the vast majority

288
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,920
of the umma is actually non-Arabs and that happened very early on extremely early on they're the

289
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,680
nucleus but that it just spread and kept on spreading and spreading and spreading the analogy of

290
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,120
Islam is like a seed right you plant a seed a tree grows but the tree has lots of fruits that

291
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,480
those fruits have seeds those seeds spread and it just and it spread like almost like pollen

292
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,880
that's how it spread and I actually Allah gave the analogy of la idaha idvallah as a tree you know

293
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:23,040
you know the example of the tree the roots are deep and the branches go into the sky and that

294
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,360
analogy is pretty amazing because actually that's kind of what happened in the world with Islam

295
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,200
you know we traveled like the wind we traveled everywhere and we just spread and spread and

296
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:42,240
spread so I I say this not just because it's a cool observation I have a request from all of you

297
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,360
you're all many of you are from different heritage different backgrounds right and when you

298
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,400
you know you you modernize and you you know the world moves forward and we have to learn the

299
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,640
language in which we can get a job and we can we have to learn the language of the university

300
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,680
a lot of times the younger generation loses the mother language right so for example I speak Urdu

301
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,400
but then I was most of my adult life I was in in the United States so I didn't speak Urdu much

302
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,360
right and then I started losing touch with Urdu and the only when I started getting back into

303
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,680
Islam I said okay I'm gonna read the Arabic if I see but I'm also gonna read Urdu literature

304
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,440
so at least I have two civilizations I have access to right so I started reading Urdu materials a

305
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,680
lot too so that kept me in touch with Urdu but while living in New York and living in Texas

306
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,840
I'm keeping in touch with my Urdu then after 30 years I went back to Pakistan 29 years to be exact

307
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,120
so I haven't been back for 29 years I go back and I start speaking and a young man came to me and

308
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:50,560
said you speak old people Urdu he literally said you speak Nawabi Urdu and I was like huh

309
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,760
and the reason he said that is because in those 30 years what happened to the Urdu language

310
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,920
it deteriorated it actually declined and so the amazing literature in Urdu that

311
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,480
your grandmother could appreciate or even I could appreciate I'd say like a grandma now but yes

312
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,520
now the next generation has less contact with it you you understand I think it's as important

313
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,920
learning the Arabic language is number one but alongside it whatever heritage you come from

314
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,080
you should master that language you shouldn't just speak it to just casually hang out you should

315
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,960
actually know its heritage its legacy especially if you're lucky enough to know something about Farsi

316
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,400
or you know the languages in which Muslims have a heritage Muslims have a history if

317
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,400
if Muslims have been in the region for a couple of hundred years or more then there's a scholarly

318
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,720
history in that literature in that in those works and you can bring that out you can expose that to

319
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,480
the rest of the world you know to the rest of the umma so they may be able to benefit anyway so

320
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,640
the aakhirin amin hum lammayal haqoobihim they haven't yet joined them lammayal just this is a small

321
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,640
grammar note manfiyu ha mus'tamir ilal hal this is a word and it means negative but negative up until

322
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,000
now wa yutawakka'u wukooruhu ba'dahu and it's expected that it will happen right after so just

323
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,040
like you say hey it has it has it's not come yet not yet there's an expectation that he's coming

324
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,320
right so Allah has set the expectation that more Muslims are now coming that are not from among the

325
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,200
Arabs this is about to get bigger and bigger and bigger okay this is really cool also al

326
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,840
al-yalhaqoobihim alhaqoobihim is joined is translated as they haven't joined them yet that's how

327
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,280
he translated it they haven't joined them yet but al-ahik bin al-thimar is actually this word is used

328
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,400
for fruits that come on the same tree one season after another season after another season so the

329
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,280
you know the next season's fruit the next season's fruit that's called al-ahik min al-thimar which is

330
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:58,640
really awesome because now we're being described as new fruits from the same tree right so the tree

331
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,200
starts with the sahaba it's the same tree and then newer and newer fruits are emerging with every

332
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,720
season and we're just another season of those fruits but the tree we belong to the same exact

333
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,360
tree it's such a beautiful connection to our history to these people that Allah has made you

334
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,760
know nations they pride themselves on their own history right and now because of after colonialism

335
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,680
there's a lot of you know because we're all nation states now right so you know you have a region

336
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,880
where they're all geographically actually very close to each other culturally they're close to

337
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,080
each other language wise they're close to each other but the the British or the French or the

338
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,560
you know the day not the Danes but the Dutch or whoever they'll come and draw a line and say okay

339
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,520
you guys are Malaysian you guys are Indonesian okay you guys are Pakistan you guys are India you

340
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,480
guys are Bangladesh you guys are Sri Lanka you guys they'll draw these lines right and it's been it

341
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,440
hasn't even been a hundred years since those lines but people now identify themselves inside these

342
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,640
lines right and then there's national pride and your flag and if there's a sport if there's a

343
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,920
match going on and everybody's waving their flag you know that kind of thing but what Allah did

344
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:18,720
is so remarkable that he actually joined us to people that we don't have any genetic connection to

345
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,720
we don't even have a geographical connection to them we're not even from the same region the

346
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,680
Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam is in hijaz and the Indonesian is on the other side of the world

347
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:36,400
and they're connected and they're bonded together and that bond is thicker than blood

348
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,840
it's thicker than blood and you know like the the the tree that gives a fruit right the fruit is

349
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,680
almost identical from the previous year's fruits it's the same it's not a different fruit it's the

350
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,000
same fruit it's a new manifestation of the fruit the only time the fruit goes bad is if there's not

351
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,080
enough water not enough sun something went bad right but the potential to produce amazing fruit

352
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,200
is always there isn't it so the idea inside this analogy is also that as generations go by it's not

353
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,120
like oh Muslims are just going to be a inferior product the good ones are all dead and the new ones

354
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,160
are you know the all the amazing Muslims died and us losers are the only ones left you know this kind

355
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,880
of mentality is also problematic because Allah has acknowledged those who will be coming and joining

356
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,440
them and he did not make them feel make them seem inferior right or the other and I've said this in

357
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,960
previous lectures but it's important to note the Arabic language is such a deep part of the of Arab

358
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:47,120
culture just like or do or Farsi or Bahasa or you know Swahili or Senegalese are part of their own

359
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:55,840
culture but Arabic Allah took it from the Arabs and he said you can't keep it for yourself you can

360
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:03,680
have it but I'm gonna make this the language of the entire Oma they're all gonna have it they're

361
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:12,800
all gonna share it so you don't have to be Arab to be Arab you just have to know Arabic

362
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:19,680
in the Arab listen Arabs are just a tongue that's all it is no other language oh once you speak it

363
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:26,640
you're that person not really you can speak German you can act German but you're not German

364
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:35,440
you know like it was pretty funny I was one time I was in back in the day I was in New York I was

365
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,040
taking a walk it was a big it's a big Russian neighborhood and I clearly don't look Russian

366
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,320
and this guy and he didn't even speak English properly he's a Russian dude

367
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,560
but he's just steady he can't stand that I'm walking by this Russian neighbor he goes

368
00:30:50,560 --> 00:31:11,120
go back to your country let's go together okay now we have to this this idea of others joining

369
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,240
we have to learn something about Jewish studies Hebrew studies that is going to help us gain

370
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,080
some perspective about this Ia I told you that in this Surah the word Quddus right the word Yuzaki

371
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,480
him there are other implications that this is actually there's a secondary audience which is some

372
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,200
some some of the factions of the rabbis right not all of them but some of them so we're gonna

373
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,720
read some things from some rabbinic attitudes towards Gentiles and the Goyim this is courtesy

374
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,760
of Dr. Sakit Hossain who's a dear friend and colleague of mine who's finished his PhD out of

375
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,320
Oxford in biblical studies Alhamdulillah he's a scholar of the Quran and he's also

376
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,120
has mastered the Hebrew language and has studied the Torah and Jewish scholarship pretty extensively

377
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,720
and writes about the correlation between the two so I and he's on my WhatsApp so I can flex that so

378
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,000
I just say hey bro I gotta give can you give me a non-phd version because I gotta talk to humans

379
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,080
so then he'll just send me like so this is from WhatsApp messages is the the truth okay the source

380
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:14,480
and concerning bloodshed in what matters is the so this is about this is their fatawa on killing

381
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,000
in their literature a non-ju against a non-ju and a non-ju against a ju is liable a ju against a

382
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,320
non-ju is exempt meaning if a member of the Israelites kills a non-ju it's not a crime

383
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,240
they're exempt okay and concerning theft in in what matter is the transgressors capable

384
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,840
in case of kidnapper a thief the one who seizes a beautiful war captive you see where that's going

385
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,600
and the like a non-ju against a non-ju and a non-ju against a ju is prohibited a ju against a

386
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,360
non-ju is permitted so there was this idea that these people you can do anything you want with them

387
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,840
in some of their groups not all of them but some of them developed this idea that us the believers

388
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,000
they saw themselves as the believers we can do anything with these kufar they're basically less

389
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,160
than human right which should sound scarily familiar because there are some muslims you if

390
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,640
if i just change the words muslim and non-muslim is from ju lanju you would think this is some

391
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,720
some muslims that are saying this nowadays right this the source of it is the tosefta it's one

392
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,400
of the earliest rabbinic texts along with the mishnah this was written around 200 bc the the

393
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,840
source the chapter is called bodh azadah which means outsider worship which is a chapter within it

394
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,320
okay let's keep going why are the gentiles impure meaning why are non-ju is impure uh in their in

395
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,960
their mind why are the kufar impure okay some rabbinic writings several classical jewish reports

396
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,440
give the view that the serpent who tempted even the garden actually copulated with her that's

397
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,400
weird but yes that's actually their interpretation which is why humanity is tainted by sin this is

398
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,600
similar to the christian idea of original sin but then israel is standing at mount syni Israel

399
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,680
in standing at mount syni had their filth cease non-jews who did not stand at the mount syni

400
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:16,560
did not have their filth cease when they stood at mount syni i told you the account that the

401
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,040
Quran describes the conversation this is their version of that conversation their version among

402
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,160
some of them the conversation is when they stood at mount syni they were forever purified and

403
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,520
everybody else they're not just their filth did not end actually they believe human beings are born

404
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,360
filthy because the children of adam are actually how what it was not with adam how what was with

405
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,200
the serpent that's what they're basically saying so this is their the jewish version in some rabbinic

406
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,120
traditions of original sin we don't believe in original sin they have that concept right the

407
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,480
general rule in early Judaism was that the categories of pure and not pure did not apply to

408
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,840
jews by the time you get to the Talmud which is completed around the sixth century there is much

409
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,680
harsher view in which Gentiles are considered impure uh so and this is some more details we

410
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,840
don't have to get into the details but let's go back to why i brought all of this up

411
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,280
Allah says

412
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,800
ummiyyin is basically their equivalent of non-jews Gentiles which they by definition consider what

413
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:29,440
what do they consider them impure he says he raised among the impure and from their perspective

414
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,560
and then what does he say about them he purifies them

415
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,360
what you say key him you see what's happening here their view was what so long as you're under

416
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:45,280
the mountain you are purified unless saying no the only thing that will purify you is the word of Allah

417
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,240
and this messenger is coming to the ummiyyin and he's purifying them and in this next slide

418
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,600
that we're studying now and by the way the only people who can access the Torah and access the

419
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:01,840
word of God are the most pure people but now these ummiyyin that are supposedly impure not only are

420
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,760
they getting purified now that he's going to teach them the the Quran the book he's gonna teach them

421
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,800
the book the purest of all scriptures he's gonna teach them that so now there's a shift in the

422
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,160
definition of purity purity is not coming from a certain race like in certain classes of hinduism

423
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,440
certain races certain classes of people are pure people and certain others are then it right

424
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,400
they're the untouchables they are the the the lower classes this didn't just happen in in in one

425
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,520
civilization there are many uh in korea in china in india there are many class societies where if

426
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,680
you're born into a certain kind of class you will remain in that class you cannot come out of that

427
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:46,000
class you are you are born into impurity you're born into it and you have to escape it somehow

428
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,480
right and the the christians even adopted it as a doctrine all human beings are born into sin

429
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,920
they're born dirty they're born impure and only through the blood of jesus can they be purified

430
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,600
and quran comes along it says no no no no hold on this is all made up the truth is every human being

431
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,520
is born pure fitlidallah that the fatala nasa adiha and the corruption comes at the hands of people

432
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,920
you weren't designed impure you were designed pure it's a it's a fundamentally different definition

433
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,000
than what you're getting in other religious traditions and by the way it those of you that

434
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,200
are students of psychology this is an interesting small fact if you believe human beings are

435
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,880
fundamentally impure born into sin lower class whatever you're born into sin then you are

436
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,480
from the beginning broken you're broken from the beginning and you just have to spend your life

437
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,680
identifying how you can undo the damage that's un inevitable you're already damaged right and

438
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,920
when you study Freudian psychology which is the father of modern psychology right you will notice

439
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,440
that that the definition of human beings they're bored they're born with certain essentially

440
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,560
psychological defects we're all basically disturbed subconsciously and i won't spell out how we're

441
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,600
disturbed if you're going to study Freud you'll know for yourself and then it's manifesting further

442
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,120
down the road as now in you know pop psychology pop psychology means anybody on twitter becomes a

443
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,800
therapist you know let me tell you how to deal with your emotions right everybody's a counselor

444
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:28,000
everybody's a therapist everybody's licensed to i love life coaches i love these guys are amazing

445
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,960
like certified certified life coach the the the the most entertaining ones are the muslim ones

446
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,080
certified good believer that and what's there you know how people put reviews underneath

447
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,240
the review is this is a really good person it's like oh okay

448
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,240
but the idea in all of these kinds of brands of therapy and i'm actually a very eager student

449
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,680
of psychology and i appreciate the science is that oh you were probably traumatized by this

450
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,920
or that or the other and you're still dealing with your trauma and you haven't healed and you're just

451
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,000
going to spend your life undoing the effects of the trauma and everybody walks out of therapy like

452
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,840
yep i'm a traumatized victim i'm i'm just i'm just trauma walking around and then you go you go

453
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:21,120
somewhere you go to your coffee place and the guy takes two extra minutes to bring your coffee

454
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,960
i'm traumatized by this late delivery and i got triggered and you're just you're just living in

455
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,640
trauma right but the the the quran's argument actually is that you were born pure and then dirt

456
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,600
came on and then when revelation comes the dirt comes off again you's a key him where you are

457
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,400
leaving the book about what hit about profound difference okay now why is this important that

458
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:52,480
means all nations are now equally blessed there's no more one blessed ethnicity the you know the the

459
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,720
the all the african nations are blessed all the australians are blessed the aborigines are blessed

460
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,320
the native americans are blessed the europeans are blessed there's no better or worse nation they're

461
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,160
all now equal because akharid i'm in home covers everybody all nations are now an extension of the

462
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,960
ummeyin which means the ummeyin didn't know any better and they could be purified you could have

463
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,280
been living in a society where there's thousands of years of shit doesn't matter you can be purified

464
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,800
too you're just just like them and purity is no longer about a special class or a lineage

465
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:29,440
you're not born royal you're not born special everyone's born special and purity is about

466
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,880
what you do with your life after that okay so now this this was just a few things about that

467
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,520
ayah well i'm in home let me have hope will be him i will just add one more thing as we as we

468
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:49,600
start this second this next ayah which is that you know Allah made us an umma that could not

469
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:56,640
distinguish between which race we come from and yet at the same time Allah says

470
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,920
he made you into nations and tribes so you can get to know each other and there's an interesting

471
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,120
tidbit there about shuroban shuroban arabic shab means people in modern arabic shab means people

472
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,880
but shab in old arabic actually used to mean a hole in the wall sometimes you have a wall it's got a

473
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,480
little crack in it or a hole in it and what do you have to do you have to fill it up right

474
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,800
shab are called people but not perfect people they have a hole they have some kind of crack

475
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,160
and some other shab have a different kind of crack and some other shab have a different kind of crack

476
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,680
and when you meet other people you're like i can learn something from you that i can fill my gap my

477
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,440
crack with there's a crack in my wall that i can fix by learning from you and you can learn something

478
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,680
for me that can fix the crack in your wall so when when believers have cultural exchange they learn

479
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,280
from each other they actually better each other and Allah designed this system of just a a bunch of

480
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,320
nations that have many strengths and some weaknesses and somebody's weakness is somebody else's what

481
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,720
strength and it's just this thing of beauty Allah created right which is kind of what i was saying

482
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,920
even in our intellectual histories in it there's a micro view but the micro view has one disadvantage

483
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,640
that you don't get the macro picture so there's these are one shab they have this kind of view

484
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,560
not another shab have that kind of view you know you were able to merge between the two of them

485
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
shawab and the tribes that you know

486
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,880
Salamu Alaikum everyone there are almost 50,000 students around the world
