0	7000	In fact, what the Qur'an did is made our spiritual identity even stronger than our ethnic identity.
7000	12000	Because the ethnic identity doesn't matter when all the Ummayyins come and sit in the same Jama'a.
12000	18000	That became second. You're Muslim first. You're sitting here. You're Pakistani second. You're German second.
18000	24000	You're Albanian second. You're Turkish second. You're Indian second. All of that is second. First thing you are is Muslim.
25000	35000	Salam Alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that so much of the work on the Qur'an has been completed on Bayna TV.
35000	42000	I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Qur'an from the beginning all the way to the end in brief and then in great detail.
42000	47000	And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on Bayna TV.com. And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV,
47000	53000	I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also. Thank you.
54000	57000	I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan.
57000	64000	When the prayer is done, you will see the earth and seek refuge from Allah.
64000	69000	Thank Allah, there is much to be done. May Allah bless you.
69000	81000	Peace be upon you.
81000	96000	The secularism is understood differently in different societies. European secularism is very different from American secularism.
96000	100000	In fact, American secularism is also different from Canadian secularism.
100000	106000	In some societies, secularism means we don't want to see religion anywhere outside your home.
106000	111000	We don't want to see it in the office. We don't want to see it in the schools. We don't want to see it in public anywhere.
111000	118000	They might even have a problem with a woman wearing a certain thing or a man having a beard or something like that and say,
118000	122000	that's too much religion. We don't want to see that even on the street.
122000	129000	That's their definition of secularism. Some nations in Europe have those kinds of definitions of secularism.
129000	138000	There's almost a fear that religion, if it shows up in the public space, will eventually start controlling society and our freedoms will be taken away.
138000	144000	So there is that kind of secularism in some countries in Europe and it comes from a history.
144000	155000	There is a history of religion oppressing its population and anybody who doesn't conform to that religion will be suppressed and will be oppressed.
155000	161000	And Europe fought hard against religious oppression to gain its freedom.
161000	170000	And that's part of the, sorry, that's part of the identity and the historical identity of this continent.
170000	177000	The American secularism is very different. American secularism is, you want to have a church? Have a church?
177000	185000	You want to have an atheist church? Have an atheist church? You want to have a devil worshipping mall? Do it.
185000	193000	You want to have a mosque? Do it. You want to do the Avan on the microphone outside? Do it. No problem. Do whatever you do.
193000	199000	Whatever religion you want to follow, you want to follow low religions, you want to follow eight religions? It's all good.
200000	206000	Do what? You want to make a new church? Do it. You want to make a new Islam? Do it. Any religion is free and over.
206000	213000	Complete absolute freedom of religion. Absolute freedom of religion. Just one thing.
213000	218000	Their definition is don't let one religion dictate how other people should live.
218000	224000	Religions have the freedom to express themselves. They have the freedom to declare themselves.
224000	231000	You are free to express any religious. You can dress however you want. You can look over. There's guidelines on minimum clothing,
231000	237000	but there's no guidelines on maximum clothing. You understand? Nobody can be told you're wearing too much.
239000	247000	Of course, discrimination happens, but it happens not at the legal level. It happens at a cultural level. You understand?
247000	256000	Now, the reason I'm bringing this up is the concept of secularism where religion is reduced to your personal life.
256000	262000	What does the Quran do with that? The Quran essentially says, yes, there's a time for the prayer.
262000	269000	Like secular definition says prayer belongs in the church, prayer belongs in the mosque, or prayer belongs inside your home.
269000	275000	Actually, in some countries prayer can't even happen in your home. If we find out you were praying in your home, you're getting arrested.
275000	284000	That exists in the world too. Some people are so scared of even Muslims. If we find out you were praying, we're going to have a problem.
284000	296000	That much control and that much restriction. However, one of the things we learned from this Hayat is our prayer inspires our behavior outside.
297000	308000	And it impacts all of our behaviors. Our business dealings, our family dealings, our personal dealings because the prayer is the definition of prayer here is
309000	321000	Fa saaw ila diqrida. And when you leave and you pursue Allah's favor in the secular realm, in education, in business, in family, in work, in public space, in government, etc.
321000	331000	Then you are inspired by the ethics and the spiritual moral code that came from the diqr of Allah that's still alive as you're practicing.
331000	334000	Wa thkurullaha kathira. Remember Allah a lot.
335000	337000	La ila kumtu fiyahun so that you may succeed.
338000	345000	We're not separating them. We're not saying, oh, and that doesn't mean that when I go into the office, I start preaching.
345000	352000	But it does mean that the code that I believe in, the diqr that Allah has given me, that impacts the way I conduct myself in the office,
352000	357000	that also impacts if I'm going to be part of a business deal or not part of a business deal.
357000	362000	That also impacts whether or not I'm going to the Christmas party or the after party or this invitation or that.
362000	365000	It's going to impact that behavior, isn't it?
365000	369000	And I'm well within my rights.
369000	377000	As someone inspired by Allah az-zawajal through this mechanism of yathno alay ima yatihe wa yuzakkihim wa yu'allibu hunkitaba wa l-hikma,
377000	381000	I will not hide who I am. That's a part of my identity.
381000	388000	In fact, what the Qur'an did is made our spiritual identity even stronger than our ethnic identity.
388000	393000	Because the ethnic identity doesn't matter when all the Ummayyins come and sit in the same jama'a.
393000	399000	That became second. You're Muslim first. You're sitting here. You're Pakistani second. You're German second.
399000	405000	You're Albanian second. You're Turkish second. You're Indian second. All of that is second. First thing you are is Muslim.
405000	408000	It's a core part of you.
408000	419000	And the thing that we often haven't really dealt with is that your religious identity does not contradict your ethnic identity
419000	422000	and it does not contradict your national identity.
422000	429000	Me being Muslim doesn't make me any less American or any less Pakistani.
429000	437000	I'm both... I'm very American and I'm very Pakistani. I'm ethnically Pakistani.
437000	442000	Country-wise, my citizenship is the United States and I love the United States. It's my country.
442000	446000	And I want the best for that country. I'm loyal to that country. Somebody might say,
446000	453000	Astaghfirullah, you're loyal to... Yeah? I am. Yusuf Aleyhisselam was loyal to Egypt.
453000	457000	He wanted the best for what's in Egypt and Egypt was pagan at the time.
457000	464000	Entirely, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was loyal to Mecca. Completely loyal to Mecca. All the time when what was there.
464000	468000	The idols. All the idols are in the Haram and he's loyal to...
468000	473000	Nuh Aleyhisselam was loyal to his people. The vast majority of his people are what?
473000	476000	Wushikun. Does that change his loyalties?
476000	482000	No. Where you're from, you don't own people, you're own, or the people that have...
482000	487000	The place that provides you an education, the place that provides you an ability to make Yudiz.
487000	492000	Allah used them as a means just like your mother and your father nourished you and nurtured you.
492000	499000	A country also provides you a place, a job, an education, opportunity, safety, security, doesn't it?
499000	504000	Are we not beneficiaries of these things? Then should we not want what is best for these places?
504000	510000	Yeah. But does that mean that we endorse everything that these countries do? No. No.
510000	513000	In fact, the most loyal American citizens, for example...
513000	518000	I'll speak for America. I can't speak for Germany. You guys can speak for Germany. I can't.
518000	524000	The most loyal citizens of the United States are sometimes the most harsh critics of United States policies
524000	528000	or United States tendencies or the direction in which a society is going.
528000	533000	That's part of the beauty of the country is that you can speak about that.
533000	539000	You can debate the ideas. You can bring them into the battlefield of ideas, you know?
539000	543000	And the thikr of Allah has to enter every space.
544000	550000	An example of this, it's rather controversial, but still I think you should know, for example,
550000	555000	one thing that's happening in the United States that may not be happening in Europe as much.
555000	561000	And I don't want to hear any questions about it in the QA. None.
561000	568000	There's a lot of, for example, new gender identity politics and LGBT and homosexuality
568000	572000	and much beyond homosexuality, gender identity itself being taught at children's schools,
572000	576000	children's books pushing this kind of an agenda.
576000	579000	And in the United States, Allah told us in the Quran
579000	582000	what to aabwad-u-adad-biri wa taqwa wa la ta'awad-u-adadifni wa-radwa'a
582000	585000	Co-operate in good things. Co-operate in taqwa.
585000	590000	So on your own time, I want you guys to search what's happening in the school systems,
590000	594000	the public school systems in Michigan, or in the state of Michigan,
594000	597000	or in Detroit or surrounding areas in the United States.
597000	603000	Michigan has a very old, very seasoned Muslim population community
603000	605000	that's been there arguably since the 50s.
605000	608000	Some of them, they're a long time.
608000	611000	And of course they have a right about Christian community, Jewish community.
611000	613000	They all live side by side.
613000	616000	And on this issue, the Muslim community, the Jewish community, the Christian community
616000	619000	have the same position on this issue.
619000	624000	And they're fighting tooth and nail at the school districts together
624000	627000	for this cause, for their children.
627000	632000	You understand? We have a view, and this is what we believe, and we're going to stand for it.
632000	637000	And there are others, Allah says, about for us to co-operate with the people of the book
637000	640000	in good things, and in matters of taqwa.
640000	642000	And this is one of those things.
642000	644000	So they're co-operating and they're standing tall.
644000	647000	I don't know how things work here, and that's not my place to know.
647000	654000	But I will tell you that wherever the zikr of Allah can enter, it must enter.
654000	656000	It must enter.
656000	661000	The principle of this ayah is religion is not relegated to the house of worship.
661000	665000	The religion is now inspiring the outside.
665000	666000	You know?
666000	670000	And when you say, well, we don't want to bring religion at all,
670000	674000	or your personal religious values at all,
674000	677000	what are those religious values that are so extreme?
677000	681000	We know, we even have misconceptions about what religion means.
681000	687000	We have the Muslims, our fundamental values are human integrity.
687000	690000	It's a fundamental human value, integrity.
690000	692000	Every person deserves respect.
692000	696000	No one should be treated less because of the color of their skin or the origin of their country,
696000	698000	because they're all children of Adam, alayhis salam.
698000	702000	Do we believe that all of humanity coming from Adam, alayhis salam?
702000	707000	The result of that, doesn't it become logical that all human beings are genetically equal?
707000	710000	Which means there's no race that's superior to any other race?
710000	717000	Which means if there's any racism against us or against any other nation, any other group, any other religion,
717000	719000	then we stand against it.
719000	722000	That's our zikr of Allah in that space.
722000	726000	So what's going to lack, I feel, is not just about us and our personal,
726000	731000	like jokingly I sometimes say, okay, if you're a student and you have a final exam at 4pm,
731000	737000	and Salatul Juma is at 1pm, then of course after Salatul Juma you'll be doing a lot of zikr of Allah,
737000	739000	right, because you're not ready for the exam.
739000	744000	So what's going to lack, I feel, is not just about you, you can succeed.
744000	747000	But Allah is actually giving us a principle here.
747000	754000	No nation will succeed if their actions and their transactions, their businesses,
754000	758000	their dealings, their family dealings, if they are removed,
758000	762000	those dealings are stripped from the remembrance of Allah.
762000	766000	If Allah is not part of those conversations and those ethics and those value systems,
766000	769000	then those nations will never ever be able to succeed.
769000	774000	They may have some rise like the Pharaohs had a rise, but they'll have a crash.
774000	775000	They cannot sustain that.
775000	776000	Allah says,
776000	779000	All of you may attain success.
779000	784000	Real harvest, which is also really incredible because previously we were told,
785000	786000	When the truth will be in him.
786000	790000	Remember what I said about the haqqa, it's the next season's fruit.
790000	793000	Remember, so every umma is the next season's fruit,
793000	794000	and now the word,
794000	796000	which means to harvest the next season.
796000	800000	Right, so you may attain success, meaning the fruit of your labor.
800000	804000	This is actually a really beautiful religion.
804000	809000	It brings beauty to every aspect of your life, every part of your thing.
809000	814000	You know, Sheikh Jamal Zarebozo, some of you might be familiar with who he is.
814000	817000	He tells a remarkable story actually of,
817000	821000	actually not just him, it was Gerald Dirks, who was a deacon,
821000	825000	who was a Christian preacher in Colorado.
825000	829000	Thousands of people used to listen to his sermons, thousands and thousands.
829000	836000	And he went to buy some groceries from an Arab grocery store,
836000	841000	and they put weight on one side, and they put the meat on the other side, right?
841000	847000	So they put the meat, but the grocery store owner put 5% extra meat.
847000	849000	He said, why are you doing that?
849000	852000	You know, there's a, you don't have to put extra.
852000	856000	He goes, no, no, no, the scale may be wrong, and it could be 5% off,
856000	860000	so I want to give you, it could be up to 2% off, but I need to give you 5% extra.
860000	863000	And he said, well, the state, because he knew some of the regulations,
863000	869000	he told them the state of Colorado, you have 2%, 3% margin of error.
869000	873000	He goes, yeah, but I don't, I can't answer my God like that.
873000	876000	I have to answer Allah on Judgment Day.
876000	878000	And he goes, what is this?
878000	881000	Why is he acting like this in a store?
881000	884000	Religion stays in the church.
884000	886000	Religion stays in the mosque, why is it coming into the store?
886000	887000	This is what's called Allah,
887000	890000	I'm not going to mention Allah a lot, because I'm going to put you in the phone.
890000	892000	I'm going to put you in the future.
892000	894000	That's better and better.
894000	899000	The way people with the balance scale, that is better, and better in the long run.
899000	904000	You know, this idea of when you have a zikr, you become people of justice,
904000	908000	you're going to fulfill your project at work, you're not going to build extra hours,
908000	910000	because you can.
910000	913000	You will let your management know I'm finished with the project,
913000	915000	I shouldn't be getting paid for work that I'm not doing.
915000	919000	You'll let them know honestly, because what's good Allah aqif,
919000	923000	you're not going to, your parents are paying for your college education,
923000	926000	or whatever, and you're going in skipping classes.
926000	928000	It's not just, you're not just cheating your parents,
928000	931000	you're violating a principle, you're violating the rukhud.
931000	934000	You're not going to do it, because what's good Allah aqif,
934000	938000	you'll even when you're stopped at a red light and there's no camera,
938000	940000	and there's no other traffic, you're not going to go,
940000	944000	because you made an agreement when you filed, when you got your license,
944000	947000	that you're going to abide by traffic laws.
947000	950000	And because Allah says, fulfill all contract agreements,
950000	954000	you're not going to cut the red light, because what's good Allah aqif,
954000	957000	this starts effecting what kind of citizen I am,
957000	960000	what kind of professional I am, what kind of family man I am,
960000	962000	what kind of wife I am, what kind of husband I am,
962000	965000	what kind of daughter, what kind of son, what kind of brother, what kind of sister,
965000	968000	all of it, what's good Allah aqif,
968000	970000	you know what you find?
970000	972000	People say, oh, we don't like European secularism,
972000	975000	we don't like secularism, we don't like religion being cut off,
975000	977000	and they're forcing this on, yeah, I don't like it either,
977000	980000	but you know what, we have our own kinds of secularism.
980000	982000	You know what kind of secularism we have?
982000	986000	Islam belongs in Ramallah, Islam belongs in the Masjid,
986000	989000	Islam belongs in the Islamic Hadaqah,
989000	992000	but the moment you're going to have a conversation with your wife or your husband,
992000	995000	or when you have a conversation with your parents,
995000	997000	or when you have conversations about money,
997000	1001000	then all the adab of Islam, all the akhlaq of Islam,
1001000	1005000	all the lessons about not doing ghiba, or backbiting,
1005000	1014000	or humazatin, lumazatin, or all of that's gone, all of it's gone.
1014000	1017000	The way you can talk about this one, or that one, or the other one,
1017000	1018000	Allah says,
1018000	1019000	what you think about,
1019000	1020000	what you think about Allah,
1020000	1022000	you think you're talking about somebody, something small,
1022000	1025000	it's huge with Allah, it's huge.
1025000	1029000	But you know what, no, no, no, I'm just saying,
1029000	1036000	what do you mean I'm just saying, isn't secularism to keep religion in some places and not in other places?
1036000	1037000	Isn't that what that is?
1037000	1041000	Isn't that what that is?
1041000	1045000	This, the ayah is so powerful because it takes the strongest,
1045000	1048000	you know, act of worship in the weak,
1048000	1050000	the biggest communal act of worship,
1050000	1053000	not everybody might get a chance to go to Hajj, it's possible,
1053000	1056000	but everybody will attend Jura.
1056000	1058000	That's our communal worship together,
1058000	1064000	and now from us being together, we spread out and we take the zikr of Allah with us in everything that we do,
1064000	1066000	in every place.
1066000	1070000	This is Allah's design for how the Deen of Allah will spread.
1070000	1073000	You know, there are many places in the world, you know how Deen spread,
1073000	1074000	it didn't even spread through da'wah,
1074000	1077000	it spread through the way Muslims do business.
1077000	1083000	You know what, millions of people became Muslim because of the way Muslims conduct themselves,
1083000	1085000	because the way Muslims treated people,
1085000	1087000	because of how honest they were with their dealings.
1087000	1089000	That was what,
1089000	1094000	Fanta shiru fil ardi wa biqabu min fabdinda wa thkurullah akathira
1094000	1097000	and then you understand what happened earlier on in the surah,
1097000	1100000	when Allah said, others haven't joined them yet, remember?
1100000	1102000	Now we learn how are others going to join,
1102000	1105000	because you're going to come, you're going to get the ayat of Allah,
1105000	1108000	you're going to spread out, they're going to see the goodness that you have,
1108000	1110000	and they're going to say, I want some of that,
1110000	1112000	how come I don't have that?
1112000	1116000	However, you know, there was a, one fellow I knew, he was actually German,
1117000	1120000	he watched his story, then I got in touch with him later,
1120000	1123000	about him and his wife.
1123000	1127000	He was like, he was a trainer in a gym, a fitness trainer.
1127000	1130000	All these clients were men and women,
1130000	1132000	you know how men and women are in the gym, right?
1132000	1134000	And there was this woman in the gym,
1134000	1137000	who she worked there and he never looked at her,
1137000	1139000	he never looked at any woman, he just didn't look.
1139000	1141000	He's like, how do you do that, why do you not look?
1141000	1143000	And he's like, I have no reason to look,
1143000	1145000	and he's just looking at her, he's like, I have no reason to look.
1146000	1149000	And he's working there, but he's keeping himself guarded.
1149000	1151000	What is this?
1151000	1153000	Because for some women, not all women, some women,
1153000	1155000	they're offended that they're not being looked at.
1156000	1159000	If I don't look at a guy, he doesn't say, hey, how come you don't look at me?
1161000	1163000	He didn't get offended, actually he might get offended
1163000	1165000	if I look at him, what you looking at bro?
1165000	1169000	That's the other way.
1169000	1172000	But she got offended, oh, how come you're not looking at me?
1172000	1174000	Why don't you look at me?
1174000	1177000	He's not looking at her, and actually she started looking into the religion
1177000	1180000	and he taught her some things about the religion
1180000	1182000	without looking at her.
1182000	1184000	She accepted Islam.
1184000	1186000	They got married.
1189000	1191000	Look at that.
1193000	1196000	But the cool thing there, you know what that is?
1196000	1199000	Did he preach? Did he preach the religion?
1199000	1203000	Did he ask her to accept Islam? Did he do any of that?
1203000	1206000	No, he was just living the thicket of Allah.
1206000	1209000	That's it, that's all he was doing.
1209000	1211000	And then that was enough.
1211000	1213000	That was enough.
1213000	1216000	Before I close, inshaAllah, I'll give you one quick story
1216000	1218000	of how this leads to success.
1218000	1221000	And this for us, it leads other people to success.
1221000	1223000	And other people finding the Deen through us
1223000	1225000	will add to our Sadaqa Jadi, isn't it?
1225000	1229000	I had a young man today remind me of a story.
1229000	1232000	So I'll share that with you because it's related to this.
1232000	1235000	It was someone I met in New York who, you know,
1235000	1238000	this guy is like not religious, okay?
1238000	1240000	He's a guy of these.
1240000	1242000	Some of them are very devout religious.
1242000	1244000	Some people, they just have Islam by name,
1244000	1246000	but they don't really practice it at all, right?
1246000	1248000	And he was one of those guys, right?
1248000	1250000	Drinking, clubbing, all of it.
1250000	1252000	And he and his girlfriend lived together for a long time.
1252000	1254000	Then they decided to get married and they're married.
1254000	1257000	And then later on, he, and she's Christian.
1257000	1259000	His girlfriend is Christian.
1259000	1261000	He married Christian lady.
1261000	1263000	He was from the Middle Ages.
1263000	1265000	He found Islam.
1265000	1267000	He starts praying again and all of that stuff.
1267000	1269000	And his wife, Christian is freaking out.
1269000	1271000	Like, what are you doing?
1271000	1273000	You're becoming an extremist.
1273000	1275000	Are you joining ISIS? Are you doing this?
1275000	1277000	Are you doing, like, she was freaking out over his religion.
1277000	1279000	And he came to the Imam. How do I give her da'wah?
1279000	1281000	I keep proving to her that three is not one
1281000	1283000	and one is not three.
1283000	1285000	I keep talking about the Trinity and I call him.
1285000	1286000	And she's not listening.
1286000	1289000	And she gets even more angry and he got good advice from someone
1289000	1293640	the religion. Just be the kind of husband the Prophet was,
1293640	1298680	Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. Just do that. Be the kind of father that he was.
1298680	1302960	Study what kind of husband was he? Study what kind of father was he? That's it.
1302960	1307400	So what does he start doing? When he gets really upset, instead of raising his voice,
1307400	1310080	he becomes quiet. Because the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, when he was really upset,
1310080	1316520	what would he do? He'd become quiet. And he like, he would be extra kind with his kids,
1316560	1323520	and he controlled his temper, and he never spoke bad words. And his behavior started
1323520	1326960	changing, and he started living, khayru kum khayru kum di adi. The best of you are the ones that are
1326960	1333560	the best to their family. So he's giving his wife gifts that are like, for no reason at all,
1333560	1337960	because he's grateful for everything that she does, and does things for her,
1337960	1341680	and helps her around the house, and starts doing things that any hadith he finds of the
1341680	1344320	Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, that he used to help around the house, or he used to do this,
1344440	1350000	or he used to acknowledge this and do that. He starts doing all of that, right? And she,
1350000	1355960	one day, without telling him, without warning, he was at home praying, and she just stood next to
1355960	1361640	him. He started praying, but I did next to him. He didn't say anything. Like he's super happy,
1361640	1367320	for the Sallallahu. But if he can say anything, he just prayed, and she just prayed, and then he
1367320	1372720	prayed some more, and she prayed some more, and they didn't really talk about it. And she just
1372720	1380560	eased into Islam. She just eased into it. There was no debate. There was no Bible versus Quran.
1380560	1386760	There was no nothing. There was no, what about Jesus? Nothing. She just eased into it. From what?
1387760	1398160	From what? Living zikr. That's living zikr. This is what actually transformed the world. What do
1398160	1403760	these people have that I want? They saw something enough that they don't see in anybody else,
1403760	1410440	and that's what made them want to become Moser. Now, we have reversed the equation. We've
1410600	1416920	re-flip the script. So now we go to non-Muslim country. You see clean streets. We see people
1416920	1422920	treating each other with respect. We see honesty and dignity and character. Then you say, I want to
1422920	1429960	go to the homelands of Islam, because I want to save my iman. And then you're going to go there.
1429960	1433840	You're going to spend a little bit of time there, and you're going to see stuff. In some places,
1434000	1440960	the Muslim world are very inspiring. I'll be honest with you. Some places. Oh, man. How could
1440960	1448160	this be that religion? And why would someone see this and say, yep, I want to be a part of this?
1449520	1454240	This is what I want to sign up for. This is the good life. You know?
1456480	1461040	This is why Allah gave us this instruction. Take inspiration from your religion. Take inspiration
1461040	1467840	from your book, and then live it outside. We have one ayah left of the Surah. We'll cover that
1467840	1472960	tomorrow. So I'll open it up for your Q&A. Please don't ask me hard questions. You guys have such
1472960	1479200	hard questions. Assalamu alaikum, everyone. There are almost 50,000 students around the world that
1479200	1484000	are interested on top of the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able
1484000	1487920	to learn that and share that with family and friends, and they need sponsorships, which is not
1487920	1492640	very expensive. So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our
1492640	1496320	sponsorship page. I appreciate it so much. And pray that Allah gives our mission success and
1496320	1500080	we're able to share the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it the world over.
