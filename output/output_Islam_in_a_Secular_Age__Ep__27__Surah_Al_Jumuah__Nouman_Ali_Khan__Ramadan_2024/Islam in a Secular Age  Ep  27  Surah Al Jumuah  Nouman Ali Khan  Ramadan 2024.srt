1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In fact, what the Qur'an did is made our spiritual identity even stronger than our ethnic identity.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Because the ethnic identity doesn't matter when all the Ummayyins come and sit in the same Jama'a.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That became second. You're Muslim first. You're sitting here. You're Pakistani second. You're German second.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're Albanian second. You're Turkish second. You're Indian second. All of that is second. First thing you are is Muslim.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Salam Alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that so much of the work on the Qur'an has been completed on Bayna TV.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Qur'an from the beginning all the way to the end in brief and then in great detail.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on Bayna TV.com. And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV,

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also. Thank you.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
When the prayer is done, you will see the earth and seek refuge from Allah.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Thank Allah, there is much to be done. May Allah bless you.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Peace be upon you.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The secularism is understood differently in different societies. European secularism is very different from American secularism.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In fact, American secularism is also different from Canadian secularism.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In some societies, secularism means we don't want to see religion anywhere outside your home.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We don't want to see it in the office. We don't want to see it in the schools. We don't want to see it in public anywhere.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They might even have a problem with a woman wearing a certain thing or a man having a beard or something like that and say,

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that's too much religion. We don't want to see that even on the street.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's their definition of secularism. Some nations in Europe have those kinds of definitions of secularism.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There's almost a fear that religion, if it shows up in the public space, will eventually start controlling society and our freedoms will be taken away.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So there is that kind of secularism in some countries in Europe and it comes from a history.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There is a history of religion oppressing its population and anybody who doesn't conform to that religion will be suppressed and will be oppressed.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And Europe fought hard against religious oppression to gain its freedom.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And that's part of the, sorry, that's part of the identity and the historical identity of this continent.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The American secularism is very different. American secularism is, you want to have a church? Have a church?

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You want to have an atheist church? Have an atheist church? You want to have a devil worshipping mall? Do it.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You want to have a mosque? Do it. You want to do the Avan on the microphone outside? Do it. No problem. Do whatever you do.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Whatever religion you want to follow, you want to follow low religions, you want to follow eight religions? It's all good.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Do what? You want to make a new church? Do it. You want to make a new Islam? Do it. Any religion is free and over.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Complete absolute freedom of religion. Absolute freedom of religion. Just one thing.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Their definition is don't let one religion dictate how other people should live.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Religions have the freedom to express themselves. They have the freedom to declare themselves.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You are free to express any religious. You can dress however you want. You can look over. There's guidelines on minimum clothing,

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but there's no guidelines on maximum clothing. You understand? Nobody can be told you're wearing too much.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Of course, discrimination happens, but it happens not at the legal level. It happens at a cultural level. You understand?

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now, the reason I'm bringing this up is the concept of secularism where religion is reduced to your personal life.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What does the Quran do with that? The Quran essentially says, yes, there's a time for the prayer.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Like secular definition says prayer belongs in the church, prayer belongs in the mosque, or prayer belongs inside your home.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Actually, in some countries prayer can't even happen in your home. If we find out you were praying in your home, you're getting arrested.

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That exists in the world too. Some people are so scared of even Muslims. If we find out you were praying, we're going to have a problem.

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That much control and that much restriction. However, one of the things we learned from this Hayat is our prayer inspires our behavior outside.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And it impacts all of our behaviors. Our business dealings, our family dealings, our personal dealings because the prayer is the definition of prayer here is

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Fa saaw ila diqrida. And when you leave and you pursue Allah's favor in the secular realm, in education, in business, in family, in work, in public space, in government, etc.

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Then you are inspired by the ethics and the spiritual moral code that came from the diqr of Allah that's still alive as you're practicing.

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Wa thkurullaha kathira. Remember Allah a lot.

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
La ila kumtu fiyahun so that you may succeed.

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We're not separating them. We're not saying, oh, and that doesn't mean that when I go into the office, I start preaching.

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But it does mean that the code that I believe in, the diqr that Allah has given me, that impacts the way I conduct myself in the office,

49
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that also impacts if I'm going to be part of a business deal or not part of a business deal.

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That also impacts whether or not I'm going to the Christmas party or the after party or this invitation or that.

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's going to impact that behavior, isn't it?

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And I'm well within my rights.

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As someone inspired by Allah az-zawajal through this mechanism of yathno alay ima yatihe wa yuzakkihim wa yu'allibu hunkitaba wa l-hikma,

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I will not hide who I am. That's a part of my identity.

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
In fact, what the Qur'an did is made our spiritual identity even stronger than our ethnic identity.

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because the ethnic identity doesn't matter when all the Ummayyins come and sit in the same jama'a.

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That became second. You're Muslim first. You're sitting here. You're Pakistani second. You're German second.

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're Albanian second. You're Turkish second. You're Indian second. All of that is second. First thing you are is Muslim.

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a core part of you.

60
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And the thing that we often haven't really dealt with is that your religious identity does not contradict your ethnic identity

61
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and it does not contradict your national identity.

62
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Me being Muslim doesn't make me any less American or any less Pakistani.

63
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm both... I'm very American and I'm very Pakistani. I'm ethnically Pakistani.

64
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Country-wise, my citizenship is the United States and I love the United States. It's my country.

65
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I want the best for that country. I'm loyal to that country. Somebody might say,

66
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Astaghfirullah, you're loyal to... Yeah? I am. Yusuf Aleyhisselam was loyal to Egypt.

67
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He wanted the best for what's in Egypt and Egypt was pagan at the time.

68
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Entirely, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was loyal to Mecca. Completely loyal to Mecca. All the time when what was there.

69
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The idols. All the idols are in the Haram and he's loyal to...

70
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Nuh Aleyhisselam was loyal to his people. The vast majority of his people are what?

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wushikun. Does that change his loyalties?

72
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No. Where you're from, you don't own people, you're own, or the people that have...

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The place that provides you an education, the place that provides you an ability to make Yudiz.

74
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Allah used them as a means just like your mother and your father nourished you and nurtured you.

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A country also provides you a place, a job, an education, opportunity, safety, security, doesn't it?

76
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are we not beneficiaries of these things? Then should we not want what is best for these places?

77
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah. But does that mean that we endorse everything that these countries do? No. No.

78
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In fact, the most loyal American citizens, for example...

79
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll speak for America. I can't speak for Germany. You guys can speak for Germany. I can't.

80
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The most loyal citizens of the United States are sometimes the most harsh critics of United States policies

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
or United States tendencies or the direction in which a society is going.

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's part of the beauty of the country is that you can speak about that.

83
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can debate the ideas. You can bring them into the battlefield of ideas, you know?

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And the thikr of Allah has to enter every space.

85
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
An example of this, it's rather controversial, but still I think you should know, for example,

86
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
one thing that's happening in the United States that may not be happening in Europe as much.

87
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And I don't want to hear any questions about it in the QA. None.

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There's a lot of, for example, new gender identity politics and LGBT and homosexuality

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and much beyond homosexuality, gender identity itself being taught at children's schools,

90
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
children's books pushing this kind of an agenda.

91
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And in the United States, Allah told us in the Quran

92
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
what to aabwad-u-adad-biri wa taqwa wa la ta'awad-u-adadifni wa-radwa'a

93
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Co-operate in good things. Co-operate in taqwa.

94
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So on your own time, I want you guys to search what's happening in the school systems,

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
the public school systems in Michigan, or in the state of Michigan,

96
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
or in Detroit or surrounding areas in the United States.

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Michigan has a very old, very seasoned Muslim population community

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
that's been there arguably since the 50s.

99
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Some of them, they're a long time.

100
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And of course they have a right about Christian community, Jewish community.

101
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They all live side by side.

102
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And on this issue, the Muslim community, the Jewish community, the Christian community

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
have the same position on this issue.

104
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And they're fighting tooth and nail at the school districts together

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
for this cause, for their children.

106
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You understand? We have a view, and this is what we believe, and we're going to stand for it.

107
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And there are others, Allah says, about for us to co-operate with the people of the book

108
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
in good things, and in matters of taqwa.

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And this is one of those things.

110
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So they're co-operating and they're standing tall.

111
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know how things work here, and that's not my place to know.

112
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But I will tell you that wherever the zikr of Allah can enter, it must enter.

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It must enter.

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The principle of this ayah is religion is not relegated to the house of worship.

115
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The religion is now inspiring the outside.

116
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know?

117
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And when you say, well, we don't want to bring religion at all,

118
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
or your personal religious values at all,

119
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
what are those religious values that are so extreme?

120
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We know, we even have misconceptions about what religion means.

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We have the Muslims, our fundamental values are human integrity.

122
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's a fundamental human value, integrity.

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Every person deserves respect.

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No one should be treated less because of the color of their skin or the origin of their country,

125
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
because they're all children of Adam, alayhis salam.

126
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Do we believe that all of humanity coming from Adam, alayhis salam?

127
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The result of that, doesn't it become logical that all human beings are genetically equal?

128
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Which means there's no race that's superior to any other race?

129
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Which means if there's any racism against us or against any other nation, any other group, any other religion,

130
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
then we stand against it.

131
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's our zikr of Allah in that space.

132
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So what's going to lack, I feel, is not just about us and our personal,

133
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
like jokingly I sometimes say, okay, if you're a student and you have a final exam at 4pm,

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and Salatul Juma is at 1pm, then of course after Salatul Juma you'll be doing a lot of zikr of Allah,

135
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
right, because you're not ready for the exam.

136
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So what's going to lack, I feel, is not just about you, you can succeed.

137
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But Allah is actually giving us a principle here.

138
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No nation will succeed if their actions and their transactions, their businesses,

139
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
their dealings, their family dealings, if they are removed,

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
those dealings are stripped from the remembrance of Allah.

141
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If Allah is not part of those conversations and those ethics and those value systems,

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
then those nations will never ever be able to succeed.

143
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They may have some rise like the Pharaohs had a rise, but they'll have a crash.

144
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They cannot sustain that.

145
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Allah says,

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
All of you may attain success.

147
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Real harvest, which is also really incredible because previously we were told,

148
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
When the truth will be in him.

149
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Remember what I said about the haqqa, it's the next season's fruit.

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Remember, so every umma is the next season's fruit,

151
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and now the word,

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
which means to harvest the next season.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Right, so you may attain success, meaning the fruit of your labor.

154
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is actually a really beautiful religion.

155
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It brings beauty to every aspect of your life, every part of your thing.

156
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You know, Sheikh Jamal Zarebozo, some of you might be familiar with who he is.

157
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He tells a remarkable story actually of,

158
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
actually not just him, it was Gerald Dirks, who was a deacon,

159
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
who was a Christian preacher in Colorado.

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Thousands of people used to listen to his sermons, thousands and thousands.

161
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And he went to buy some groceries from an Arab grocery store,

162
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and they put weight on one side, and they put the meat on the other side, right?

163
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So they put the meat, but the grocery store owner put 5% extra meat.

164
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He said, why are you doing that?

165
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You know, there's a, you don't have to put extra.

166
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He goes, no, no, no, the scale may be wrong, and it could be 5% off,

167
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
so I want to give you, it could be up to 2% off, but I need to give you 5% extra.

168
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And he said, well, the state, because he knew some of the regulations,

169
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
he told them the state of Colorado, you have 2%, 3% margin of error.

170
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He goes, yeah, but I don't, I can't answer my God like that.

171
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I have to answer Allah on Judgment Day.

172
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And he goes, what is this?

173
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why is he acting like this in a store?

174
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Religion stays in the church.

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Religion stays in the mosque, why is it coming into the store?

176
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This is what's called Allah,

177
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm not going to mention Allah a lot, because I'm going to put you in the phone.

178
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm going to put you in the future.

179
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's better and better.

180
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The way people with the balance scale, that is better, and better in the long run.

181
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You know, this idea of when you have a zikr, you become people of justice,

182
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you're going to fulfill your project at work, you're not going to build extra hours,

183
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
because you can.

184
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You will let your management know I'm finished with the project,

185
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I shouldn't be getting paid for work that I'm not doing.

186
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You'll let them know honestly, because what's good Allah aqif,

187
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
you're not going to, your parents are paying for your college education,

188
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
or whatever, and you're going in skipping classes.

189
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's not just, you're not just cheating your parents,

190
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
you're violating a principle, you're violating the rukhud.

191
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're not going to do it, because what's good Allah aqif,

192
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
you'll even when you're stopped at a red light and there's no camera,

193
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and there's no other traffic, you're not going to go,

194
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
because you made an agreement when you filed, when you got your license,

195
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that you're going to abide by traffic laws.

196
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And because Allah says, fulfill all contract agreements,

197
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you're not going to cut the red light, because what's good Allah aqif,

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
this starts effecting what kind of citizen I am,

199
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
what kind of professional I am, what kind of family man I am,

200
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
what kind of wife I am, what kind of husband I am,

201
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
what kind of daughter, what kind of son, what kind of brother, what kind of sister,

202
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
all of it, what's good Allah aqif,

203
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
you know what you find?

204
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
People say, oh, we don't like European secularism,

205
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
we don't like secularism, we don't like religion being cut off,

206
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and they're forcing this on, yeah, I don't like it either,

207
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
but you know what, we have our own kinds of secularism.

208
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You know what kind of secularism we have?

209
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Islam belongs in Ramallah, Islam belongs in the Masjid,

210
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Islam belongs in the Islamic Hadaqah,

211
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
but the moment you're going to have a conversation with your wife or your husband,

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
or when you have a conversation with your parents,

213
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
or when you have conversations about money,

214
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
then all the adab of Islam, all the akhlaq of Islam,

215
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
all the lessons about not doing ghiba, or backbiting,

216
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:54,000
or humazatin, lumazatin, or all of that's gone, all of it's gone.

217
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The way you can talk about this one, or that one, or the other one,

218
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Allah says,

219
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
what you think about,

220
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
what you think about Allah,

221
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you think you're talking about somebody, something small,

222
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
it's huge with Allah, it's huge.

223
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But you know what, no, no, no, I'm just saying,

224
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
what do you mean I'm just saying, isn't secularism to keep religion in some places and not in other places?

225
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Isn't that what that is?

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Isn't that what that is?

227
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This, the ayah is so powerful because it takes the strongest,

228
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
you know, act of worship in the weak,

229
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
the biggest communal act of worship,

230
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
not everybody might get a chance to go to Hajj, it's possible,

231
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but everybody will attend Jura.

232
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's our communal worship together,

233
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and now from us being together, we spread out and we take the zikr of Allah with us in everything that we do,

234
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
in every place.

235
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is Allah's design for how the Deen of Allah will spread.

236
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You know, there are many places in the world, you know how Deen spread,

237
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it didn't even spread through da'wah,

238
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
it spread through the way Muslims do business.

239
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You know what, millions of people became Muslim because of the way Muslims conduct themselves,

240
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
because the way Muslims treated people,

241
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
because of how honest they were with their dealings.

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That was what,

243
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Fanta shiru fil ardi wa biqabu min fabdinda wa thkurullah akathira

244
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and then you understand what happened earlier on in the surah,

245
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
when Allah said, others haven't joined them yet, remember?

246
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Now we learn how are others going to join,

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
because you're going to come, you're going to get the ayat of Allah,

248
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
you're going to spread out, they're going to see the goodness that you have,

249
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and they're going to say, I want some of that,

250
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
how come I don't have that?

251
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
However, you know, there was a, one fellow I knew, he was actually German,

252
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
he watched his story, then I got in touch with him later,

253
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
about him and his wife.

254
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
He was like, he was a trainer in a gym, a fitness trainer.

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
All these clients were men and women,

256
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
you know how men and women are in the gym, right?

257
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And there was this woman in the gym,

258
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
who she worked there and he never looked at her,

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
he never looked at any woman, he just didn't look.

260
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He's like, how do you do that, why do you not look?

261
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And he's like, I have no reason to look,

262
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and he's just looking at her, he's like, I have no reason to look.

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And he's working there, but he's keeping himself guarded.

264
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What is this?

265
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because for some women, not all women, some women,

266
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
they're offended that they're not being looked at.

267
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If I don't look at a guy, he doesn't say, hey, how come you don't look at me?

268
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He didn't get offended, actually he might get offended

269
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
if I look at him, what you looking at bro?

270
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That's the other way.

271
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But she got offended, oh, how come you're not looking at me?

272
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why don't you look at me?

273
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He's not looking at her, and actually she started looking into the religion

274
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and he taught her some things about the religion

275
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
without looking at her.

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
She accepted Islam.

277
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
They got married.

278
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Look at that.

279
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But the cool thing there, you know what that is?

280
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Did he preach? Did he preach the religion?

281
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Did he ask her to accept Islam? Did he do any of that?

282
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No, he was just living the thicket of Allah.

283
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's it, that's all he was doing.

284
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And then that was enough.

285
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That was enough.

286
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Before I close, inshaAllah, I'll give you one quick story

287
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
of how this leads to success.

288
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And this for us, it leads other people to success.

289
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And other people finding the Deen through us

290
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
will add to our Sadaqa Jadi, isn't it?

291
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I had a young man today remind me of a story.

292
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So I'll share that with you because it's related to this.

293
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It was someone I met in New York who, you know,

294
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
this guy is like not religious, okay?

295
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
He's a guy of these.

296
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Some of them are very devout religious.

297
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Some people, they just have Islam by name,

298
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but they don't really practice it at all, right?

299
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And he was one of those guys, right?

300
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Drinking, clubbing, all of it.

301
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And he and his girlfriend lived together for a long time.

302
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Then they decided to get married and they're married.

303
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And then later on, he, and she's Christian.

304
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
His girlfriend is Christian.

305
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He married Christian lady.

306
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He was from the Middle Ages.

307
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He found Islam.

308
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He starts praying again and all of that stuff.

309
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And his wife, Christian is freaking out.

310
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Like, what are you doing?

311
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You're becoming an extremist.

312
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Are you joining ISIS? Are you doing this?

313
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Are you doing, like, she was freaking out over his religion.

314
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And he came to the Imam. How do I give her da'wah?

315
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I keep proving to her that three is not one

316
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and one is not three.

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I keep talking about the Trinity and I call him.

318
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And she's not listening.

319
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And she gets even more angry and he got good advice from someone

320
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,640
the religion. Just be the kind of husband the Prophet was,

321
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,680
Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. Just do that. Be the kind of father that he was.

322
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,960
Study what kind of husband was he? Study what kind of father was he? That's it.

323
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,400
So what does he start doing? When he gets really upset, instead of raising his voice,

324
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,080
he becomes quiet. Because the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, when he was really upset,

325
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,520
what would he do? He'd become quiet. And he like, he would be extra kind with his kids,

326
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:03,520
and he controlled his temper, and he never spoke bad words. And his behavior started

327
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,960
changing, and he started living, khayru kum khayru kum di adi. The best of you are the ones that are

328
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,560
the best to their family. So he's giving his wife gifts that are like, for no reason at all,

329
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,960
because he's grateful for everything that she does, and does things for her,

330
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,680
and helps her around the house, and starts doing things that any hadith he finds of the

331
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,320
Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, that he used to help around the house, or he used to do this,

332
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,000
or he used to acknowledge this and do that. He starts doing all of that, right? And she,

333
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,960
one day, without telling him, without warning, he was at home praying, and she just stood next to

334
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,640
him. He started praying, but I did next to him. He didn't say anything. Like he's super happy,

335
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,320
for the Sallallahu. But if he can say anything, he just prayed, and she just prayed, and then he

336
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,720
prayed some more, and she prayed some more, and they didn't really talk about it. And she just

337
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:00,560
eased into Islam. She just eased into it. There was no debate. There was no Bible versus Quran.

338
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,760
There was no nothing. There was no, what about Jesus? Nothing. She just eased into it. From what?

339
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:18,160
From what? Living zikr. That's living zikr. This is what actually transformed the world. What do

340
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,760
these people have that I want? They saw something enough that they don't see in anybody else,

341
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,440
and that's what made them want to become Moser. Now, we have reversed the equation. We've

342
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,920
re-flip the script. So now we go to non-Muslim country. You see clean streets. We see people

343
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,920
treating each other with respect. We see honesty and dignity and character. Then you say, I want to

344
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:49,960
go to the homelands of Islam, because I want to save my iman. And then you're going to go there.

345
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,840
You're going to spend a little bit of time there, and you're going to see stuff. In some places,

346
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,960
the Muslim world are very inspiring. I'll be honest with you. Some places. Oh, man. How could

347
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,160
this be that religion? And why would someone see this and say, yep, I want to be a part of this?

348
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,240
This is what I want to sign up for. This is the good life. You know?

349
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,040
This is why Allah gave us this instruction. Take inspiration from your religion. Take inspiration

350
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:27,840
from your book, and then live it outside. We have one ayah left of the Surah. We'll cover that

351
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,960
tomorrow. So I'll open it up for your Q&A. Please don't ask me hard questions. You guys have such

352
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,200
hard questions. Assalamu alaikum, everyone. There are almost 50,000 students around the world that

353
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,000
are interested on top of the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able

354
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,920
to learn that and share that with family and friends, and they need sponsorships, which is not

355
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,640
very expensive. So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our

356
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,320
sponsorship page. I appreciate it so much. And pray that Allah gives our mission success and

357
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,080
we're able to share the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it the world over.
