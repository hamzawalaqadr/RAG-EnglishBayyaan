1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
In many cultures, you cannot get married until you have this much degree, this much money,

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,840
you've done this, this, this, this, and then maybe we'll think about getting you married.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,640
And then once you are ready to get married, the mahar has to be this amount and this amount and this amount.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,340
What Allah did in Islam is He made the path to halal easy and the path to haram difficult.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,000
And when you make the path to halal difficult automatically, what becomes a lot easier?

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,000
The haram becomes way easier. It's so much easier.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,380
You know?

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,640
Assalamu alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,800
so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayanat TV.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,840
I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,920
in brief and then in great detail.

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,080
And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on BayanatTV.com

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,620
and once you appreciate what's going on in Bayanat TV,

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,380
I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,220
and give it as a gift also. Thank you.

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,860
Anyway, so now let's move on to financial cleansing.

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,460
Don't cheat each other in money matters.

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,740
Don't use money to grease the palms of politicians.

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,140
So you can cheat people and take their money.

20
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,340
Don't use bribery and corruption in politics.

21
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,220
Don't use corruption in financial matters.

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,180
You know, don't cheat each other, pay each other's money back, have clear contracts, fulfill your agreements.

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,620
What is that doing in a society?

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,420
It's cleaning up the financial dealings in a society, isn't it?

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,660
That's also a cleansing. There's a familial cleansing.

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,060
You know, this society, European society, Western society, America and Australia and Canadian,

27
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,660
they're all different.

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,700
But one thing you will notice there that you don't see as much in the Muslim world today is law and order.

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,980
Right? They have some things that I wish we saw more of in the Muslim world.

30
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,500
I was in Denmark in one place taking a walk and some guy was telling strawberries

31
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,060
and he just left his strawberries by the water with a bucket to put money in

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,180
and the sign of how much you can weight yourself, put money yourself.

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,860
And people come and they put the money in the goal.

34
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,780
And I'm like, huh, let's try this in Pakistan.

35
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:28,100
Forget the strawberries, the weighing machine.

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,980
So you look at and some of some of them, they come from, they see all that kind of corruption in the Muslim world

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,740
and then they come to Western nations to see there's so much honesty and integrity and there's so much good.

38
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:54,780
Yes, in some matters, they are actually closer to Tessgihar than the Muslims are, culturally speaking.

39
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,220
It's true. They're more integrity.

40
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,860
But in other matters, like, for example, how we treat our parents,

41
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,820
but the way Islam conditions us to treat our parents, especially as they get older.

42
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,500
Do you see how people are treated in these societies, how elders are treated in these societies,

43
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
how teenagers treat their parents?

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,260
Some guys, you know, dad's name is Frank and he was going to call them daddies and say, hey, Frank,

45
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,420
I'll be out late.

46
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,980
You know, and my dad's stupid, man, my old man, they don't even call my old man.

47
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,420
Right. My mom is so annoying.

48
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,820
I hate my parents.

49
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Now you can have emancipation laws in America.

50
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,020
We have emancipation laws, meaning I declare myself free of my parents.

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,100
I have nothing to do with you.

52
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,780
They could do that.

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:59,060
And you have this beautiful tradition inspired by our religion, where we do we treat our parents with kindness and respect and goodness and

54
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,180
ihsan and everything that we can do with them.

55
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,220
That's and our siblings and our the young, right?

56
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,940
There's a there's a lot of them.

57
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,340
There's a love and care towards them, even the prohibition of alcohol.

58
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,460
Right. You will think it just has to do with food.

59
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,580
Do you know how many families are destroyed because of alcohol?

60
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,140
Like or gambling unless it's don't gamble, you know how many families are destroyed because of gambling?

61
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,860
Right. When he when he says don't commit Zina, you know how many families are destroyed because of Zina?

62
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,180
Right. So like the laws actually purify the life of a family.

63
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,060
And even the way in which breakups happen.

64
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,540
Okay, marriage is a reality.

65
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,260
So is divorce and divorce is ugly.

66
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,740
It gets ugly.

67
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,820
You know, I used to love you.

68
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,340
Now I don't.

69
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,500
I want to get away.

70
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,140
Well, Allah says, yeah, it might get ugly.

71
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,260
Here are exhaustive instructions on how to make sure divorce doesn't get ugly.

72
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,540
You know, in the Quran, Allah didn't talk about marriage a lot, but he talked about divorce a lot.

73
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,020
There's like multiple pages on divorce in Surat al-Baqarah.

74
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,420
There's a whole Surah, Surat al-Talaq.

75
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,980
There's no long.

76
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,380
Here's how to make a marriage happy.

77
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,660
That's just on YouTube.

78
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,260
That's not in the Quran.

79
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,340
You know why?

80
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,900
Because you can figure out how to make a marriage work, but you don't know how to make a clean exit.

81
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,260
You don't know that.

82
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,740
So Allah will teach you that.

83
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,820
He purified relationships.

84
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,380
He even purified the ends of relationships.

85
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,620
He purified even matters that happen after death, like how should family assets be destroyed?

86
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,020
Asset be distributed.

87
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,780
And then of course, there is societal cleansing.

88
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,300
Societal cleansing means Allah saved us from the burdens of culture.

89
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,260
Allah saved us because cultures create standards that are very difficult.

90
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:58,500
You know, like for example, in many cultures, you cannot get married until you have this much degree, this much money.

91
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,740
You've done this, this, this, this, and then maybe we'll think about getting you married.

92
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,380
And then once you are ready to get married, the maharat has to be this amount and this amount and this amount.

93
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:15,100
And then if you are going to get married, we have to have this kind of a hall and this kind of catering and these kinds of gifts.

94
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,740
And there's like the bill keeps going higher and higher and higher and higher.

95
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:28,420
And what Allah did in Islam is he made the path to halal easy and the path to haram difficult.

96
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,420
And what many cultures do is they make the path to halal extremely difficult.

97
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,460
And when you make the path to halal difficult automatically, what becomes a lot easier?

98
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,540
The haram becomes way easier.

99
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,900
It's so much easier.

100
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:57,540
You know, so what is even at a societal level, what our religion did is actually, you know, prevent evil by making the thing that Allah makes Allah is happy with.

101
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,620
He makes that easier.

102
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,700
But cultures make it difficult.

103
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,780
Culture.

104
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,420
And what's ironic to me is Muslim cultures make halal more difficult than even non-Muslim cultures.

105
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,140
Muslim cultures make halal more difficult.

106
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,020
And then we complain that the youth are going towards haram.

107
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,460
Right?

108
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,460
And we don't even address the root causes of it.

109
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,020
And all of these purifications are actually connected to each other.

110
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,180
Let me just give you a quick example, because this is something you should really contemplate.

111
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,980
Financial cleansing.

112
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,460
If you get rid of financial corruption in a society, you know what that means?

113
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,060
People can art an honest living.

114
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,580
Yes or no?

115
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,820
He says, don't pay politicians to get your way.

116
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,500
Didn't he say that?

117
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:47,180
Now, what happens in many Muslim societies, for example, you will get a job if your uncle is connected, if your dad's connected, if your friends, dads, cousins, brothers, whatever's connected, isn't it?

118
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:54,980
And even if you didn't do well on the exam, you can pay a little bit to the principal of the school or that or whoever, and you can get the degree.

119
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,900
You can buy the degree.

120
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,180
Or you can pay for your score.

121
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,180
Happens or no?

122
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,060
When people who didn't earn their degree get their degree and get their license.

123
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,460
What happens to the people who actually worked hard to get their degree?

124
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Now they can't get a job.

125
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,220
Now their education means nothing.

126
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,660
Because now the people who didn't deserve are being moved out.

127
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,380
Now the people who could have earned are no longer in a position to earn.

128
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,420
And now they're no longer in a position to earn, which means they're no longer in a position to get married.

129
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:37,660
And then the people who are doing haram and money things, usually don't just do haram and money things, they do haram in everything.

130
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,860
So they're living the life they look like they're in Jannah.

131
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,260
So they're making haram look really good.

132
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,980
Because the more haram you do, the more you get in life.

133
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,700
And everybody else is looking at them and saying,

134
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,540
I wish I had what Karun has.

135
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,500
I wish I had a big wedding like that.

136
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,700
I wish I had a hall like that.

137
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,940
I wish I had family like that.

138
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,900
I had money like that.

139
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,580
I had clothes like that and a car like that.

140
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,820
I had a job like that.

141
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:08,020
Then you say, well, the only way you can get that is you got to start playing the game like they know how to play the game.

142
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,660
You got to lie a little bit on your resume.

143
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,500
You got to make some connections.

144
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
You got to get dirty.

145
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,940
You want to win this game?

146
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,220
You want to win in politics?

147
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,220
Life is dirty.

148
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,980
What is the opposite of dirty?

149
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,380
Pure.

150
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,260
What is a key him?

151
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,180
Right.

152
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,340
This is a very comprehensive statement.

153
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,660
And which is why I wanted to talk to you at the bottom.

154
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,380
Tuskegee starts with something in turtle.

155
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,220
Like introductory Tuskegee is my thoughts are becoming cleaner.

156
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,020
My opinions are becoming cleaner.

157
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,500
My worldview is becoming cleaner.

158
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,980
It's being detoxed from cultural imprints, from previous religious imprints.

159
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,540
Those are now getting away and I'm becoming cleansed in my thoughts by revelation.

160
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,940
But there's deep Tuskegee.

161
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,180
Let me give you the analogy.

162
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:55,500
If you have an impurity on your skin, something like dirt, is that easy to wash or no?

163
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Yeah, that's easy to wash.

164
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,260
But if you have an infection inside, is that easy to get rid of?

165
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,340
No.

166
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,700
And the deeper and impurity is, the more painful it is to.

167
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,300
Extract it.

168
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,020
If a bullet has entered inside the body, then there has to be surgery, painful

169
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,180
surgery to extract it.

170
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,940
When it when a society has deep filth, when a family has deep filth, when you've

171
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,820
you've been living in deep filth and then you start to cleanse yourself, then you

172
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,380
have to go through painful surgery, which means the people that try to purify

173
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,900
themselves. This is a very painful process.

174
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,380
This is not an easy at the beginning.

175
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,540
It's just an intellectual process, a spiritual process.

176
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,100
That's fine.

177
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,940
But when you actually start taking steps towards purifying yourself, it's a

178
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,740
painful process.

179
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,100
An easy example of that, just because I don't want to speak only abstract.

180
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,940
I want to give you concrete examples of this.

181
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,500
It's like I reminded of a young man I met.

182
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,580
He was a little bit younger than me.

183
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,460
I met him at a masjid after Maghrib.

184
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,380
He was just kind of sitting there in the back waiting.

185
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,020
And I just decided to just have a chat with him.

186
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,820
And he said, I have never seen the inside of a masjid before in my life.

187
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,020
I was like, did you recently accept Islam?

188
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,540
He goes, no, I was born in a Muslim family.

189
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,380
And we don't pray.

190
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,300
I was like, why don't you pray?

191
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,540
I was like, well, our family is not religious.

192
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,340
And even though we're Muslim by name, we actually really hate Islam in my family.

193
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,420
And we own a bunch of bars in New York.

194
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,420
We have 20 bars.

195
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,500
Our family owns 20 bars in New York.

196
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,780
Very successful bar business.

197
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,380
All Muslims, by the way.

198
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,700
And we drink alcohol more than we drink water.

199
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,540
That's just in our family.

200
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,100
That's what we do.

201
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,300
I've done that my whole life.

202
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,540
And something just came in my head that I shouldn't drink anymore.

203
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,420
It just makes me do things I don't like myself when I drink.

204
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,540
And when he stopped drinking, he became curious about the Quran.

205
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,980
And he started reading a little bit, then watched some YouTube videos

206
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,580
and found out I was at this masjid.

207
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,340
He's like, ever since I stopped, I don't even pray yet.

208
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,020
He said, I don't even pray yet.

209
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,020
He said, but I just stopped drinking and my whole family cut me off.

210
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,780
And they're like, they're threatening me.

211
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,820
They're threatening to sue me.

212
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,340
I can't even go back to my home.

213
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,420
They changed the lock on the door.

214
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,100
I don't know where to go.

215
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,900
I don't know what to do.

216
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,740
What's he doing?

217
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,980
He took one step towards cleansing himself.

218
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,180
And look at the pain he's been through.

219
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,300
You understand?

220
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,740
So when he says, use a key him.

221
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,100
See the first step was actually painless.

222
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,300
He recites the ayat.

223
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,900
You listen to the ayat.

224
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,060
You hear what Allah is saying.

225
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,100
You can walk away.

226
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,660
Somebody heard the ayat in the marketplace and they walked away.

227
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,300
No problem.

228
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,140
But someone who decides that they're going to wait,

229
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,260
what did I just hear?

230
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,620
I need to hear more of this.

231
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,220
I need to go listen.

232
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,420
And when you start to try to purify yourself,

233
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,300
you need to purify yourself.

234
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,500
You need to purify yourself.

235
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,100
You start to try to purify yourself.

236
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,380
Man, the pain begins.

237
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,580
Some of you actually haven't told your families that you're here.

238
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,340
You're here secretly because your families can't tolerate that you're learning.

239
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,900
They can't tolerate that you're in a mud.

240
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,540
You went where?

241
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,220
In a musted?

242
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,300
Why?

243
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,620
Why did you go to a musted?

244
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,340
Is this why we brought you to Germany?

245
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,460
This is why we live here?

246
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,580
You want to be an extremist?

247
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,660
You want me to call the police on you now?

248
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,220
And like, I'm just not going to quietly.

249
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,140
I'm going to the library.

250
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,100
Okay.

251
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,980
And you show up.

252
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,700
Teske is painful.

253
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,260
The Sahaba started going through Teske.

254
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,100
Some people heard him.

255
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,140
They started listening to him.

256
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,700
And this is what I want you to understand the difference between

257
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,660
actually two things.

258
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,100
Use a key him and use a key be him.

259
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,180
He purifies them and he purifies them using it, meaning the Quran.

260
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,380
Actually, Allah is highlighting.

261
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,420
There's a Tawassur here.

262
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,620
I'll super simplify this.

263
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,540
Allah is saying the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is purifying these people

264
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,700
that are coming close to him, not just by the Quran, but he was also by his company.

265
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,820
So if he was use a key him be he, then it would be about the Quran alone.

266
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,140
But use a key him now includes the Quran and includes the Prophet's company.

267
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,340
So Allah already use them.

268
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,980
So there's the wassur in this phrasing.

269
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,660
I also want you to understand this in easy marketing terms.

270
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,420
You guys understand the term funnel marketing?

271
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,900
You first expose somebody to the product and then you get them to click on your website

272
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,580
and then they get more information, right?

273
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,340
The Yatlu Aalayhim Ayatihi is just exposing people to revelation.

274
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,860
Just let them hear what it is.

275
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,820
And then some of them will say, I want to know more.

276
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,820
And the ones who want to know more will take a deeper dive and what's going to start

277
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,500
happening with their thoughts, with their opinions, with their views,

278
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,380
with their view of the world, with their hearts, with their emotions,

279
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,060
and eventually even with their actions.

280
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,300
That's going to be use a key him.

281
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,860
That's the second step.

282
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,300
Is everybody who hears the ayat going to make it to the second step?

283
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,060
No, some people will.

284
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,100
And some people will get a little bit of it and then say that's enough for me.

285
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,540
And others will say, no, this is not enough.

286
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,660
I need to take a deeper look.

287
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,660
Because this, the moment it starts getting painful,

288
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,820
some people say, you know what, I'm going to go back.

289
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,700
This is too painful.

290
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,460
And then people say, no, no, no.

291
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,900
You can't get really detoxed unless you go through some pain.

292
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,340
There has to be some surgical process here.

293
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,420
So they keep taking these further and further steps.

294
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,380
We'll use a key him.

295
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,620
Okay.

296
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,620
So this is understanding the progression.

297
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,140
Now we get to, and I'll give you a break in a minute,

298
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,420
but it reduces the next part.

299
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,620
A new verb.

300
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,940
He says he reads the ayat.

301
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,180
He purifies them.

302
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,660
But then he says he teaches them.

303
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,580
He teaches them.

304
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,220
What is the difference between reading something to someone and teaching someone?

305
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,220
It's a big difference or not?

306
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,420
When you read something, if I read something to you,

307
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,860
like the news is reading something to the audience, isn't it?

308
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,340
And you can listen to one hour of the news.

309
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,500
And then after listening to the news, I say, okay,

310
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,540
now give me a full summary.

311
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,100
What was said?

312
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,180
What's happening in Ukraine?

313
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,020
What's happening in the Khadij?

314
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,660
What's happening here?

315
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,780
What's happening there?

316
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,420
How many this?

317
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,500
How many I start quizzing you after listening to one hour of the BBC or whatever you listen to.

318
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,700
Are you able to answer all those questions?

319
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,500
Because when you listen to something, something was read to you,

320
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,180
that doesn't mean you actually learned it.

321
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,940
You just got exposed to it.

322
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,380
It's casual.

323
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,220
You're doing it while driving.

324
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,740
You're doing it while doing other tasks.

325
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,620
But if I teach you something, you know what that means?

326
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,140
That means, one, you are completely dedicated to learning.

327
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,460
Because you can't teach someone in the mall.

328
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,180
You have to teach someone in the classroom.

329
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,300
You have to teach someone who decides to become a student.

330
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,340
What I want you to recognize here is when the word youalimu is used,

331
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,340
now the audience is even more restricted.

332
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,060
Yatlu is the broadest audience.

333
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,860
Yuzakihim is the lesser audience.

334
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,740
And even within that is a subset, which is what?

335
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,020
Youalimu hon.

336
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,820
He teaches them.

337
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,260
He teaches them.

338
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,780
And now this teaching is about the Prophet,

339
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,500
alayhi wasalam, actually educating a handful of people

340
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,980
that are going to become his top students.

341
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,660
And they have to show him extra dedication for learning.

342
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,780
And this is actually the exact process that we must introduce in our communities,

343
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,580
around the world.

344
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,780
Muslim communities are around the world.

345
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,580
They say, why don't youth come to the masjid?

346
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,660
How come they don't come?

347
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,340
How can we do so many programs, but we only see old people there?

348
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,580
There's a young people coming.

349
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,820
Well, they're not coming because they don't know what they should come for.

350
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,420
They haven't been exposed to why should they even be interested.

351
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,340
What step gets them at least interested?

352
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,700
Why is this so powerful?

353
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,980
Why is this so miraculous?

354
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,940
Why do I need to learn it?

355
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,660
That's which step?

356
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,300
One, yatlu alayhim ayatihi.

357
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,020
That's step one.

358
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,980
And if somebody does become curious,

359
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,500
then there should be something there for them to nurture them

360
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,300
and to allow them to become cleansed little by little,

361
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,180
which is step one.

362
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,940
That's step two.

363
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,300
That's yukizakim.

364
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,780
There's something that, okay, let's take you,

365
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,500
let's give you some company where you can learn more,

366
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,980
or you can be around a company that supports you

367
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,340
and helps you cleanse your thoughts,

368
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,060
and you can share your ideas, your opinions,

369
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,500
your previous knowledge,

370
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,100
and that can get corrected a little bit.

371
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,460
That's deskia.

372
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,980
You're getting corrected intellectually.

373
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,140
You're getting corrected in your habits.

374
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,860
There were guys that used bad words.

375
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,940
Every other word that comes out of their mouth is a bad word.

376
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:29,900
Right?

377
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,660
Like, if you go to, you know, I moved to Texas.

378
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,340
People in Texas are nice.

379
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,420
They're actually nice.

380
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,340
So when you go to the store, they'll say,

381
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,340
hi, sir, how are you, sir?

382
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,860
How's it going, ma'am?

383
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,580
Oh, let me get that door for you.

384
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,820
Not like Germany.

385
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,180
I'm gonna tell you.

386
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,180
Well, you know, people are nice in Texas,

387
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,460
but when I used to live in New York,

388
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,980
I didn't realize in New York,

389
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,700
people use such bad language all the time.

390
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,540
They cannot say something like, I am at the bus stop.

391
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,740
They can't say that.

392
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,620
They have to say, I'm at the bus stop.

393
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,140
You heard?

394
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,340
Like, it's a verb.

395
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,140
It's an adverb.

396
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,860
It's an adjective.

397
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,140
It's a preposition.

398
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,340
It's every part of speech.

399
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,380
Okay.

400
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,900
That's a necessary insertion in between.

401
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,500
You know how some people are extra religious?

402
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
They like say subhanallah in everything,

403
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,380
like awkwardly.

404
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,860
Like, is it, some people, they just say that, you know,

405
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,580
sometimes I get awkward around those people.

406
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Like, some people are overly subhanallah.

407
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,060
Like we're at a restaurant.

408
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,540
Sheikh, what are you gonna order subhanallah?

409
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,980
I was like, I'm not a sheikh.

410
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,940
And I'm just gonna place it order.

411
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,660
Yeah, subhanallah.

412
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,220
What would you like?

413
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,460
Oh, I'll have the chicken, shall we?

414
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,980
Oh, chicken subhanallah.

415
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,140
I'm like, okay.

416
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,980
That's better than New York.

417
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,700
Yo, boop, boop, boop.

418
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,900
Do you want any boop chicken?

419
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,020
And two extremes.

420
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,340
Yes, I'll have some subhanallah chicken.

421
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:09,660
But,

422
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,660
but the read, what I'm saying is some young man

423
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,780
who comes out of New York,

424
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,380
or comes out of that, you know, Berlin, I don't know.

425
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,100
They come, they come from that language.

426
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,020
And that's normal for them.

427
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,980
They use that all the time.

428
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,220
Some of you guys sitting in the masjid here,

429
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,740
you're a certain way here.

430
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,940
But when you're at school,

431
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,500
with your friends, that's a different kind of German in it.

432
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,100
That's a, that's, you know, that's a, that's spicy.

433
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,620
And then you replace that with subhanallah over here.

434
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,900
That's what you gotta do, right?

435
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,900
So, but when you're in good company for a longer time,

436
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,260
what happens to that young man?

437
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,420
He starts using those words.

438
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:56,700
Less.

439
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,980
Because that company is slowly detoxing those words.

440
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,220
Be said, is school for so called bad that he man,

441
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,660
that's the detox too, isn't it?

442
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,820
And then the things you talk about,

443
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,660
when you're, when you're with your boys at school,

444
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,660
and when you're girls in school,

445
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,340
what kind of subjects are you talking about?

446
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,540
You don't.

447
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,100
And then you're in a better company,

448
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,700
and what kinds of things are you talking about?

449
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,580
You're in a company learning something about the Quran.

450
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,020
What kinds of things are you discussing?

451
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,300
You know, a personal experience of mine on this,

452
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,060
and I'll give you a break, is that when I was in high school,

453
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,220
I was not into Islam at all.

454
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,860
All my friends were non-Muslim, all of them.

455
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,780
And I have a vicious, cruel sense of humor.

456
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,980
Like, I love humiliating people.

457
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,140
Like, this is one of my, one of my shaitans

458
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,620
is when people say something,

459
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,540
I can rip them apart.

460
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,060
And I was full on in high school.

461
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,020
Oh my, I was so insulting in high school.

462
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,100
I was the king of insults.

463
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,900
And then you come into like, the Islamic scene, right?

464
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,460
And you can't, like, which one, well, it's so easy.

465
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,100
Somebody's gonna just want to rip them apart,

466
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,140
like, no, no, no.

467
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,220
Subhanallah.

468
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,620
But one of the things that happened was,

469
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,980
my old friends, the things we used to talk about is,

470
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,220
you know, sports, cars, other things that shall not be named.

471
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,260
And then I go with my new friends

472
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,940
at the Muslim Students Association,

473
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,420
and we go to this, I went to the poor people school,

474
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,380
Baruch College, which was like $1,600 a semester.

475
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,580
That was the poor people college.

476
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,980
One time, we went to a Muslim Students Association

477
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,940
at Columbia University, which was like $40,000 a year

478
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,900
for 17, 18-year-olds.

479
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,500
So those are the rich people school.

480
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,300
So I was like, man, there's gonna be some rich Muslims in Columbia.

481
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,820
Let's go see what the rich Muslims do.

482
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,140
So we go there, we're sitting in a circle,

483
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,900
and there's a bunch of college students

484
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,260
that are maybe a year or two older than me.

485
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,060
They're 18, 19 years old, 20 years old at the most.

486
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,700
And they're discussing how they're trying to put money together

487
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,780
to sponsor orphans that have been distraended

488
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,020
because of a flood that happened in Bangladesh.

489
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,180
And they've got a banner of one of the kids

490
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,380
that they're trying to sponsor.

491
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,700
And these students are gonna make some difference

492
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,900
by helping this one child.

493
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,540
And I come from a company of guys that are like,

494
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,740
yo, what are we gonna do this weekend?

495
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,140
What are we gonna go?

496
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,700
What should we do?

497
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,620
These are the conversations,

498
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,420
the low-level conversations.

499
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,500
And now I'm in the company of people

500
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,940
that are a year or two older than I am.

501
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,340
They're much wealthier than I am.

502
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,660
They're much more prestigious than I am in my mind.

503
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,100
So you would think if they have more money,

504
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,100
they have more prestige, they're wealthier.

505
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,260
They must be partying way harder.

506
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,220
And yet they're talking about things that are really

507
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,140
so high up.

508
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,260
And I felt dirty inside.

509
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,100
What is it that makes these young people think like this?

510
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,180
How come I don't think like this?

511
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,060
How come my mind is down here and their mind is up there?

512
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,780
Something that Allah's Deen does,

513
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,140
something that this book does, is that it cleanses.

514
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,340
So,

515
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,100
Du'aadihi ma'yatihi wa yuzaqeeb.

516
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,220
And then from there, from that cleansing,

517
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,020
then you get to you,

518
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,900
adeemuhumil kitab.

519
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,180
I'll tell you one more thing.

520
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,300
If you started teaching the fsir,

521
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,220
high level tfsir,

522
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,340
or you started teaching fiqh,

523
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,020
or you started teaching aqeedah, or whatever,

524
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,780
you started these classes and courses,

525
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,740
how many people show up?

526
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,580
Five people?

527
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,980
That becomes three people?

528
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,500
That is just the Imam and his best friend?

529
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,100
And then there's a wedding the next weekend and then,

530
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,380
you know, it's just tarakuqa qa'ima,

531
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,260
they just leave you alone.

532
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,500
All these people don't even want an education.

533
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,700
They don't want to learn anything.

534
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,300
Well, they don't want to learn anything

535
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,100
because the first two steps aren't in place.

536
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,420
When those steps are in place,

537
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,180
by the way, the people who will seriously learn

538
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,860
it will never be a large population.

539
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,980
The people who will seriously learn

540
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,180
will always be a smaller population, right?

541
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,460
Because you can't expect that high level of commitment

542
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,100
from everybody.

543
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,540
In fact, that wasn't even expected from all the sahaba.

544
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,380
Not all the sahaba were learning all the time.

545
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,260
There were people in,

546
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,060
you know,

547
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,580
oh, they were on the sofa.

548
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,420
They were subset.

549
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,020
They were not everyone.

550
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,540
Everyone had other responsibilities.

551
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,660
So there will be some learning that happens

552
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,580
and happens more exclusively.

553
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,180
So you shouldn't guilt yourself.

554
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,380
That's the other thing about this.

555
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,500
You shouldn't guilt yourself

556
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,260
that you're not engaged in higher learning.

557
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,700
And until you do higher learning

558
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,460
and you become a sheikh yourself or,

559
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,260
you know, you leave society and go sit under a tree

560
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,420
to learn some classical texts,

561
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,620
then you're not a good Muslim.

562
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,340
No, that's not the point.

563
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,380
The point is the few who do learn,

564
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,300
their responsibility becomes to teach.

565
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,740
Everyone else.

566
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,020
And the Quran talks about that too.

567
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,380
Allah talks about that too.

568
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,340
But I will now,

569
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,100
in our next session after your break,

570
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,220
I'm going to dedicate our time

571
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,380
talking about Al-Kitab particularly.

572
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,500
And I'm going to share some things with you

573
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,940
Al-Kitab and then Al-Hikmah

574
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,900
and wrap up today's session.

575
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,740
BarakAllahu Lillahi Wabarakum Tul Qura'iru Hakim

576
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,740
Wala Fa'ali Wa Iyya'akum Ridayat Wadhakil Hakim.

577
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,540
Asalaamu Alaykum everyone.

578
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,260
There are almost 50,000 students around the world

579
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,500
that are interested on top of the students we have

580
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,660
in studying the Quran and its meanings

581
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,780
and being able to learn that

582
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,460
and share that with family and friends.

583
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,660
And they need sponsorships,

584
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,860
which is not very expensive.

585
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,860
So if you can help sponsor students

586
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,820
on Bayna TV,

587
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,580
please do so and visit our sponsorship page.

588
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,780
I appreciate it so much.

589
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,460
And pray that Allah gives our mission success

590
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,460
and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran

591
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,300
and the beauty of it the world over.
