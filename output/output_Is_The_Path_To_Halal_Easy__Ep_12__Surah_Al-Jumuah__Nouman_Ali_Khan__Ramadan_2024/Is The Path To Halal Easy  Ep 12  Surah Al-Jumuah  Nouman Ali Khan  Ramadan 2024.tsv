0	5740	In many cultures, you cannot get married until you have this much degree, this much money,
5740	9840	you've done this, this, this, this, and then maybe we'll think about getting you married.
9840	14640	And then once you are ready to get married, the mahar has to be this amount and this amount and this amount.
14640	22340	What Allah did in Islam is He made the path to halal easy and the path to haram difficult.
22340	28000	And when you make the path to halal difficult automatically, what becomes a lot easier?
28160	31000	The haram becomes way easier. It's so much easier.
31880	32380	You know?
37140	40640	Assalamu alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that
41040	43800	so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayanat TV.
43800	47840	I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end
48080	49920	in brief and then in great detail.
50120	53080	And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on BayanatTV.com
53080	55620	and once you appreciate what's going on in Bayanat TV,
55660	59380	I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family
59380	61220	and give it as a gift also. Thank you.
62140	65860	Anyway, so now let's move on to financial cleansing.
67020	71460	Don't cheat each other in money matters.
71460	76740	Don't use money to grease the palms of politicians.
77860	81140	So you can cheat people and take their money.
81820	84340	Don't use bribery and corruption in politics.
84740	88220	Don't use corruption in financial matters.
89380	95180	You know, don't cheat each other, pay each other's money back, have clear contracts, fulfill your agreements.
96180	97620	What is that doing in a society?
97620	100420	It's cleaning up the financial dealings in a society, isn't it?
101300	104660	That's also a cleansing. There's a familial cleansing.
105420	110060	You know, this society, European society, Western society, America and Australia and Canadian,
110060	110660	they're all different.
110660	115700	But one thing you will notice there that you don't see as much in the Muslim world today is law and order.
116980	119980	Right? They have some things that I wish we saw more of in the Muslim world.
120540	124500	I was in Denmark in one place taking a walk and some guy was telling strawberries
124780	129060	and he just left his strawberries by the water with a bucket to put money in
129380	132180	and the sign of how much you can weight yourself, put money yourself.
132660	134860	And people come and they put the money in the goal.
135620	139780	And I'm like, huh, let's try this in Pakistan.
140980	148100	Forget the strawberries, the weighing machine.
156420	160980	So you look at and some of some of them, they come from, they see all that kind of corruption in the Muslim world
161220	166740	and then they come to Western nations to see there's so much honesty and integrity and there's so much good.
167220	174780	Yes, in some matters, they are actually closer to Tessgihar than the Muslims are, culturally speaking.
175100	177220	It's true. They're more integrity.
178780	182860	But in other matters, like, for example, how we treat our parents,
183660	187820	but the way Islam conditions us to treat our parents, especially as they get older.
189100	194500	Do you see how people are treated in these societies, how elders are treated in these societies,
194860	196860	how teenagers treat their parents?
197420	202260	Some guys, you know, dad's name is Frank and he was going to call them daddies and say, hey, Frank,
203420	204420	I'll be out late.
205820	210980	You know, and my dad's stupid, man, my old man, they don't even call my old man.
211940	214420	Right. My mom is so annoying.
215620	217820	I hate my parents.
217820	219820	Now you can have emancipation laws in America.
219820	223020	We have emancipation laws, meaning I declare myself free of my parents.
223300	228100	I have nothing to do with you.
228780	229780	They could do that.
230580	239060	And you have this beautiful tradition inspired by our religion, where we do we treat our parents with kindness and respect and goodness and
239420	241180	ihsan and everything that we can do with them.
242340	246220	That's and our siblings and our the young, right?
246260	247940	There's a there's a lot of them.
247940	251340	There's a love and care towards them, even the prohibition of alcohol.
251900	253460	Right. You will think it just has to do with food.
253460	255580	Do you know how many families are destroyed because of alcohol?
257220	261140	Like or gambling unless it's don't gamble, you know how many families are destroyed because of gambling?
262740	267860	Right. When he when he says don't commit Zina, you know how many families are destroyed because of Zina?
269460	274180	Right. So like the laws actually purify the life of a family.
275140	278060	And even the way in which breakups happen.
279060	280540	Okay, marriage is a reality.
280540	283260	So is divorce and divorce is ugly.
283940	284740	It gets ugly.
285500	286820	You know, I used to love you.
286820	287340	Now I don't.
288660	289500	I want to get away.
290380	292140	Well, Allah says, yeah, it might get ugly.
292260	296260	Here are exhaustive instructions on how to make sure divorce doesn't get ugly.
296860	300540	You know, in the Quran, Allah didn't talk about marriage a lot, but he talked about divorce a lot.
302220	305020	There's like multiple pages on divorce in Surat al-Baqarah.
305020	306420	There's a whole Surah, Surat al-Talaq.
307140	307980	There's no long.
307980	309380	Here's how to make a marriage happy.
309620	310660	That's just on YouTube.
312220	313260	That's not in the Quran.
315180	316340	You know why?
316340	320900	Because you can figure out how to make a marriage work, but you don't know how to make a clean exit.
322340	323260	You don't know that.
323660	324740	So Allah will teach you that.
325260	326820	He purified relationships.
327060	329380	He even purified the ends of relationships.
329780	335620	He purified even matters that happen after death, like how should family assets be destroyed?
335740	337020	Asset be distributed.
337820	339780	And then of course, there is societal cleansing.
340580	344300	Societal cleansing means Allah saved us from the burdens of culture.
345340	349260	Allah saved us because cultures create standards that are very difficult.
350100	358500	You know, like for example, in many cultures, you cannot get married until you have this much degree, this much money.
358860	362740	You've done this, this, this, this, and then maybe we'll think about getting you married.
362740	367380	And then once you are ready to get married, the maharat has to be this amount and this amount and this amount.
368420	375100	And then if you are going to get married, we have to have this kind of a hall and this kind of catering and these kinds of gifts.
375140	379740	And there's like the bill keeps going higher and higher and higher and higher.
380220	388420	And what Allah did in Islam is he made the path to halal easy and the path to haram difficult.
389100	395420	And what many cultures do is they make the path to halal extremely difficult.
395660	400460	And when you make the path to halal difficult automatically, what becomes a lot easier?
401220	402540	The haram becomes way easier.
402540	403900	It's so much easier.
404940	417540	You know, so what is even at a societal level, what our religion did is actually, you know, prevent evil by making the thing that Allah makes Allah is happy with.
417660	418620	He makes that easier.
418620	420700	But cultures make it difficult.
421420	421780	Culture.
421780	427420	And what's ironic to me is Muslim cultures make halal more difficult than even non-Muslim cultures.
428500	430140	Muslim cultures make halal more difficult.
430140	433020	And then we complain that the youth are going towards haram.
434140	434460	Right?
434540	436460	And we don't even address the root causes of it.
436460	440020	And all of these purifications are actually connected to each other.
440220	443180	Let me just give you a quick example, because this is something you should really contemplate.
443900	444980	Financial cleansing.
444980	448460	If you get rid of financial corruption in a society, you know what that means?
448460	450060	People can art an honest living.
450060	450580	Yes or no?
451700	453820	He says, don't pay politicians to get your way.
453860	454500	Didn't he say that?
455100	467180	Now, what happens in many Muslim societies, for example, you will get a job if your uncle is connected, if your dad's connected, if your friends, dads, cousins, brothers, whatever's connected, isn't it?
468140	474980	And even if you didn't do well on the exam, you can pay a little bit to the principal of the school or that or whoever, and you can get the degree.
474980	475900	You can buy the degree.
477140	479180	Or you can pay for your score.
479500	480180	Happens or no?
481180	487060	When people who didn't earn their degree get their degree and get their license.
487700	490460	What happens to the people who actually worked hard to get their degree?
491740	492740	Now they can't get a job.
493620	495220	Now their education means nothing.
495780	498660	Because now the people who didn't deserve are being moved out.
499380	503380	Now the people who could have earned are no longer in a position to earn.
504220	508420	And now they're no longer in a position to earn, which means they're no longer in a position to get married.
509980	517660	And then the people who are doing haram and money things, usually don't just do haram and money things, they do haram in everything.
518460	520860	So they're living the life they look like they're in Jannah.
521500	523260	So they're making haram look really good.
523780	525980	Because the more haram you do, the more you get in life.
526900	528700	And everybody else is looking at them and saying,
530940	532540	I wish I had what Karun has.
532980	534500	I wish I had a big wedding like that.
534500	535700	I wish I had a hall like that.
535700	536940	I wish I had family like that.
536940	537900	I had money like that.
537900	539580	I had clothes like that and a car like that.
539740	540820	I had a job like that.
541940	548020	Then you say, well, the only way you can get that is you got to start playing the game like they know how to play the game.
549020	550660	You got to lie a little bit on your resume.
551140	552500	You got to make some connections.
553100	554100	You got to get dirty.
554740	555940	You want to win this game?
555940	557220	You want to win in politics?
557340	558220	Life is dirty.
558580	559980	What is the opposite of dirty?
559980	560380	Pure.
560380	561260	What is a key him?
562780	563180	Right.
563660	566340	This is a very comprehensive statement.
566340	568660	And which is why I wanted to talk to you at the bottom.
569260	571380	Tuskegee starts with something in turtle.
571380	574220	Like introductory Tuskegee is my thoughts are becoming cleaner.
574580	576020	My opinions are becoming cleaner.
576020	577500	My worldview is becoming cleaner.
577740	581980	It's being detoxed from cultural imprints, from previous religious imprints.
581980	586540	Those are now getting away and I'm becoming cleansed in my thoughts by revelation.
586780	587940	But there's deep Tuskegee.
588140	589180	Let me give you the analogy.
589420	595500	If you have an impurity on your skin, something like dirt, is that easy to wash or no?
596420	597420	Yeah, that's easy to wash.
597420	601260	But if you have an infection inside, is that easy to get rid of?
602020	602340	No.
602340	606700	And the deeper and impurity is, the more painful it is to.
607580	608300	Extract it.
609180	613020	If a bullet has entered inside the body, then there has to be surgery, painful
613020	615180	surgery to extract it.
615500	620940	When it when a society has deep filth, when a family has deep filth, when you've
620940	625820	you've been living in deep filth and then you start to cleanse yourself, then you
625820	629380	have to go through painful surgery, which means the people that try to purify
629380	631900	themselves. This is a very painful process.
632700	634380	This is not an easy at the beginning.
634380	636540	It's just an intellectual process, a spiritual process.
636540	637100	That's fine.
637260	640940	But when you actually start taking steps towards purifying yourself, it's a
640940	641740	painful process.
641740	645100	An easy example of that, just because I don't want to speak only abstract.
645100	646940	I want to give you concrete examples of this.
647340	649500	It's like I reminded of a young man I met.
650220	651580	He was a little bit younger than me.
651580	654460	I met him at a masjid after Maghrib.
654460	656380	He was just kind of sitting there in the back waiting.
657100	659020	And I just decided to just have a chat with him.
659580	663820	And he said, I have never seen the inside of a masjid before in my life.
663820	667020	I was like, did you recently accept Islam?
667020	668540	He goes, no, I was born in a Muslim family.
669180	670380	And we don't pray.
671180	672300	I was like, why don't you pray?
672780	674540	I was like, well, our family is not religious.
674540	679340	And even though we're Muslim by name, we actually really hate Islam in my family.
679340	681420	And we own a bunch of bars in New York.
682140	683420	We have 20 bars.
683420	685500	Our family owns 20 bars in New York.
685500	686780	Very successful bar business.
687180	688380	All Muslims, by the way.
689340	692700	And we drink alcohol more than we drink water.
693500	694540	That's just in our family.
694540	695100	That's what we do.
695100	696300	I've done that my whole life.
697340	700540	And something just came in my head that I shouldn't drink anymore.
701420	705420	It just makes me do things I don't like myself when I drink.
706940	710540	And when he stopped drinking, he became curious about the Quran.
711260	713980	And he started reading a little bit, then watched some YouTube videos
713980	715580	and found out I was at this masjid.
715900	719340	He's like, ever since I stopped, I don't even pray yet.
719900	721020	He said, I don't even pray yet.
721740	725020	He said, but I just stopped drinking and my whole family cut me off.
727260	728780	And they're like, they're threatening me.
728780	729820	They're threatening to sue me.
729820	731340	I can't even go back to my home.
731340	733420	They changed the lock on the door.
734380	735100	I don't know where to go.
735100	735900	I don't know what to do.
737020	737740	What's he doing?
737740	739980	He took one step towards cleansing himself.
741580	743180	And look at the pain he's been through.
743500	744300	You understand?
744300	745740	So when he says, use a key him.
745740	749100	See the first step was actually painless.
749100	750300	He recites the ayat.
750300	751900	You listen to the ayat.
751900	754060	You hear what Allah is saying.
754060	755100	You can walk away.
755100	757660	Somebody heard the ayat in the marketplace and they walked away.
757660	758300	No problem.
759340	762140	But someone who decides that they're going to wait,
762140	763260	what did I just hear?
763260	764620	I need to hear more of this.
765180	766220	I need to go listen.
767180	769420	And when you start to try to purify yourself,
769420	770300	you need to purify yourself.
770300	771500	You need to purify yourself.
771500	773100	You start to try to purify yourself.
773100	774380	Man, the pain begins.
774940	777580	Some of you actually haven't told your families that you're here.
779340	783340	You're here secretly because your families can't tolerate that you're learning.
784300	785900	They can't tolerate that you're in a mud.
785900	786540	You went where?
787580	788220	In a musted?
789980	790300	Why?
791740	792620	Why did you go to a musted?
793260	795340	Is this why we brought you to Germany?
796540	798460	This is why we live here?
798460	799580	You want to be an extremist?
800300	801660	You want me to call the police on you now?
803340	806220	And like, I'm just not going to quietly.
806220	808140	I'm going to the library.
810460	811100	Okay.
811100	811980	And you show up.
813660	814700	Teske is painful.
815500	817260	The Sahaba started going through Teske.
818220	819100	Some people heard him.
819100	820140	They started listening to him.
820140	822700	And this is what I want you to understand the difference between
822700	823660	actually two things.
823660	825100	Use a key him and use a key be him.
825260	829180	He purifies them and he purifies them using it, meaning the Quran.
829180	830380	Actually, Allah is highlighting.
830380	831420	There's a Tawassur here.
831420	832620	I'll super simplify this.
832620	836540	Allah is saying the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is purifying these people
836540	840700	that are coming close to him, not just by the Quran, but he was also by his company.
842140	845820	So if he was use a key him be he, then it would be about the Quran alone.
845820	850140	But use a key him now includes the Quran and includes the Prophet's company.
850140	851340	So Allah already use them.
851980	853980	So there's the wassur in this phrasing.
854860	857660	I also want you to understand this in easy marketing terms.
857660	859420	You guys understand the term funnel marketing?
860460	865900	You first expose somebody to the product and then you get them to click on your website
865900	867580	and then they get more information, right?
867580	871340	The Yatlu Aalayhim Ayatihi is just exposing people to revelation.
871340	872860	Just let them hear what it is.
873660	875820	And then some of them will say, I want to know more.
876700	879820	And the ones who want to know more will take a deeper dive and what's going to start
879820	883500	happening with their thoughts, with their opinions, with their views,
883500	886380	with their view of the world, with their hearts, with their emotions,
886380	888060	and eventually even with their actions.
888940	890300	That's going to be use a key him.
891180	892860	That's the second step.
892860	896300	Is everybody who hears the ayat going to make it to the second step?
896300	898060	No, some people will.
898060	901100	And some people will get a little bit of it and then say that's enough for me.
901100	902540	And others will say, no, this is not enough.
902540	903660	I need to take a deeper look.
904940	907660	Because this, the moment it starts getting painful,
907660	909820	some people say, you know what, I'm going to go back.
909820	910700	This is too painful.
911260	912460	And then people say, no, no, no.
913020	915900	You can't get really detoxed unless you go through some pain.
917100	919340	There has to be some surgical process here.
919340	921420	So they keep taking these further and further steps.
921420	922380	We'll use a key him.
922380	922620	Okay.
923260	924620	So this is understanding the progression.
924620	928140	Now we get to, and I'll give you a break in a minute,
928140	929420	but it reduces the next part.
929980	930620	A new verb.
931260	932940	He says he reads the ayat.
933500	935180	He purifies them.
935180	937660	But then he says he teaches them.
938620	939580	He teaches them.
940300	944220	What is the difference between reading something to someone and teaching someone?
945100	946220	It's a big difference or not?
947260	949420	When you read something, if I read something to you,
949420	952860	like the news is reading something to the audience, isn't it?
953820	955340	And you can listen to one hour of the news.
955340	957500	And then after listening to the news, I say, okay,
957500	958540	now give me a full summary.
958540	959100	What was said?
960060	961180	What's happening in Ukraine?
961740	963020	What's happening in the Khadij?
963020	963660	What's happening here?
963660	964780	What's happening there?
964780	965420	How many this?
965420	969500	How many I start quizzing you after listening to one hour of the BBC or whatever you listen to.
970140	972700	Are you able to answer all those questions?
974300	977500	Because when you listen to something, something was read to you,
977500	979180	that doesn't mean you actually learned it.
979740	980940	You just got exposed to it.
981740	982380	It's casual.
983020	984220	You're doing it while driving.
984220	985740	You're doing it while doing other tasks.
986620	990620	But if I teach you something, you know what that means?
991260	994140	That means, one, you are completely dedicated to learning.
994700	996460	Because you can't teach someone in the mall.
997660	999180	You have to teach someone in the classroom.
1000140	1002300	You have to teach someone who decides to become a student.
1003740	1007340	What I want you to recognize here is when the word youalimu is used,
1007340	1009340	now the audience is even more restricted.
1010620	1012060	Yatlu is the broadest audience.
1012700	1014860	Yuzakihim is the lesser audience.
1014860	1017740	And even within that is a subset, which is what?
1017740	1019020	Youalimu hon.
1019020	1019820	He teaches them.
1020540	1021260	He teaches them.
1021820	1024780	And now this teaching is about the Prophet,
1025340	1029500	alayhi wasalam, actually educating a handful of people
1029500	1031980	that are going to become his top students.
1032940	1035660	And they have to show him extra dedication for learning.
1036860	1042780	And this is actually the exact process that we must introduce in our communities,
1042780	1043580	around the world.
1043580	1044780	Muslim communities are around the world.
1045660	1047580	They say, why don't youth come to the masjid?
1048860	1049660	How come they don't come?
1050380	1053340	How can we do so many programs, but we only see old people there?
1054220	1055580	There's a young people coming.
1055580	1057820	Well, they're not coming because they don't know what they should come for.
1058620	1061420	They haven't been exposed to why should they even be interested.
1061420	1063340	What step gets them at least interested?
1063340	1064700	Why is this so powerful?
1064700	1065980	Why is this so miraculous?
1065980	1066940	Why do I need to learn it?
1066940	1067660	That's which step?
1068460	1070300	One, yatlu alayhim ayatihi.
1070300	1071020	That's step one.
1072220	1073980	And if somebody does become curious,
1074780	1077500	then there should be something there for them to nurture them
1077500	1080300	and to allow them to become cleansed little by little,
1080300	1081180	which is step one.
1082060	1082940	That's step two.
1082940	1084300	That's yukizakim.
1084300	1086780	There's something that, okay, let's take you,
1086780	1089500	let's give you some company where you can learn more,
1089500	1091980	or you can be around a company that supports you
1091980	1093340	and helps you cleanse your thoughts,
1093340	1096060	and you can share your ideas, your opinions,
1096060	1097500	your previous knowledge,
1097500	1099100	and that can get corrected a little bit.
1099660	1100460	That's deskia.
1100460	1101980	You're getting corrected intellectually.
1102620	1104140	You're getting corrected in your habits.
1105260	1106860	There were guys that used bad words.
1106860	1108940	Every other word that comes out of their mouth is a bad word.
1109660	1109900	Right?
1110460	1113660	Like, if you go to, you know, I moved to Texas.
1114220	1115340	People in Texas are nice.
1116060	1117420	They're actually nice.
1117420	1119340	So when you go to the store, they'll say,
1119340	1121340	hi, sir, how are you, sir?
1121980	1122860	How's it going, ma'am?
1124220	1125580	Oh, let me get that door for you.
1126860	1127820	Not like Germany.
1128620	1129180	I'm gonna tell you.
1131660	1133180	Well, you know, people are nice in Texas,
1133180	1134460	but when I used to live in New York,
1134460	1135980	I didn't realize in New York,
1135980	1138700	people use such bad language all the time.
1139580	1142540	They cannot say something like, I am at the bus stop.
1143100	1143740	They can't say that.
1143740	1146620	They have to say, I'm at the bus stop.
1147660	1148140	You heard?
1150860	1153340	Like, it's a verb.
1153340	1154140	It's an adverb.
1154140	1154860	It's an adjective.
1154860	1156140	It's a preposition.
1156140	1157340	It's every part of speech.
1158060	1158380	Okay.
1159100	1161900	That's a necessary insertion in between.
1161900	1163500	You know how some people are extra religious?
1163500	1165500	They like say subhanallah in everything,
1165500	1166380	like awkwardly.
1166940	1170860	Like, is it, some people, they just say that, you know,
1171900	1173580	sometimes I get awkward around those people.
1173580	1175580	Like, some people are overly subhanallah.
1176940	1178060	Like we're at a restaurant.
1178700	1180540	Sheikh, what are you gonna order subhanallah?
1180540	1183980	I was like, I'm not a sheikh.
1185420	1186940	And I'm just gonna place it order.
1186940	1187660	Yeah, subhanallah.
1187660	1188220	What would you like?
1188220	1190460	Oh, I'll have the chicken, shall we?
1190460	1191980	Oh, chicken subhanallah.
1191980	1196140	I'm like, okay.
1196700	1197980	That's better than New York.
1199500	1200700	Yo, boop, boop, boop.
1200700	1201900	Do you want any boop chicken?
1204060	1205020	And two extremes.
1207420	1209340	Yes, I'll have some subhanallah chicken.
1209340	1209660	But,
1213100	1215660	but the read, what I'm saying is some young man
1215660	1216780	who comes out of New York,
1217740	1220380	or comes out of that, you know, Berlin, I don't know.
1221420	1223100	They come, they come from that language.
1224060	1225020	And that's normal for them.
1225020	1225980	They use that all the time.
1226700	1228220	Some of you guys sitting in the masjid here,
1228220	1229740	you're a certain way here.
1229740	1230940	But when you're at school,
1232140	1235500	with your friends, that's a different kind of German in it.
1237100	1241100	That's a, that's, you know, that's a, that's spicy.
1242380	1244620	And then you replace that with subhanallah over here.
1244620	1245900	That's what you gotta do, right?
1245900	1251900	So, but when you're in good company for a longer time,
1251900	1253260	what happens to that young man?
1254060	1255420	He starts using those words.
1256380	1256700	Less.
1257660	1261980	Because that company is slowly detoxing those words.
1261980	1264220	Be said, is school for so called bad that he man,
1264220	1265660	that's the detox too, isn't it?
1266540	1267820	And then the things you talk about,
1267820	1269660	when you're, when you're with your boys at school,
1270220	1271660	and when you're girls in school,
1271660	1273340	what kind of subjects are you talking about?
1274060	1274540	You don't.
1275740	1277100	And then you're in a better company,
1277100	1278700	and what kinds of things are you talking about?
1279820	1281580	You're in a company learning something about the Quran.
1281580	1283020	What kinds of things are you discussing?
1283900	1286300	You know, a personal experience of mine on this,
1286300	1290060	and I'll give you a break, is that when I was in high school,
1290060	1292220	I was not into Islam at all.
1293180	1294860	All my friends were non-Muslim, all of them.
1295740	1300780	And I have a vicious, cruel sense of humor.
1301900	1303980	Like, I love humiliating people.
1304620	1308140	Like, this is one of my, one of my shaitans
1309420	1310620	is when people say something,
1310620	1312540	I can rip them apart.
1313900	1316060	And I was full on in high school.
1316060	1319020	Oh my, I was so insulting in high school.
1319020	1321100	I was the king of insults.
1322140	1327900	And then you come into like, the Islamic scene, right?
1327900	1330460	And you can't, like, which one, well, it's so easy.
1331420	1333100	Somebody's gonna just want to rip them apart,
1333100	1334140	like, no, no, no.
1335340	1336220	Subhanallah.
1340780	1342620	But one of the things that happened was,
1342700	1345980	my old friends, the things we used to talk about is,
1345980	1350220	you know, sports, cars, other things that shall not be named.
1351660	1353260	And then I go with my new friends
1353260	1354940	at the Muslim Students Association,
1354940	1357420	and we go to this, I went to the poor people school,
1357420	1360380	Baruch College, which was like $1,600 a semester.
1360380	1361580	That was the poor people college.
1362140	1363980	One time, we went to a Muslim Students Association
1363980	1366940	at Columbia University, which was like $40,000 a year
1368140	1369900	for 17, 18-year-olds.
1369900	1371500	So those are the rich people school.
1371500	1374300	So I was like, man, there's gonna be some rich Muslims in Columbia.
1374300	1375820	Let's go see what the rich Muslims do.
1376620	1378140	So we go there, we're sitting in a circle,
1378140	1379900	and there's a bunch of college students
1379900	1381260	that are maybe a year or two older than me.
1381260	1384060	They're 18, 19 years old, 20 years old at the most.
1384060	1386700	And they're discussing how they're trying to put money together
1386700	1390780	to sponsor orphans that have been distraended
1390780	1393020	because of a flood that happened in Bangladesh.
1393020	1395180	And they've got a banner of one of the kids
1395180	1396380	that they're trying to sponsor.
1397020	1398700	And these students are gonna make some difference
1398700	1399900	by helping this one child.
1400460	1402540	And I come from a company of guys that are like,
1402540	1403740	yo, what are we gonna do this weekend?
1405100	1406140	What are we gonna go?
1406140	1406700	What should we do?
1407660	1408620	These are the conversations,
1409740	1411420	the low-level conversations.
1411980	1413500	And now I'm in the company of people
1413500	1414940	that are a year or two older than I am.
1415500	1417340	They're much wealthier than I am.
1417340	1419660	They're much more prestigious than I am in my mind.
1419660	1421100	So you would think if they have more money,
1421100	1423100	they have more prestige, they're wealthier.
1423740	1425260	They must be partying way harder.
1426380	1428220	And yet they're talking about things that are really
1429180	1430140	so high up.
1431500	1433260	And I felt dirty inside.
1434220	1437100	What is it that makes these young people think like this?
1438140	1439180	How come I don't think like this?
1439900	1442060	How come my mind is down here and their mind is up there?
1443020	1444780	Something that Allah's Deen does,
1444780	1448140	something that this book does, is that it cleanses.
1448780	1449340	So,
1449340	1451100	Du'aadihi ma'yatihi wa yuzaqeeb.
1451100	1454220	And then from there, from that cleansing,
1454220	1455020	then you get to you,
1455020	1455900	adeemuhumil kitab.
1455900	1457180	I'll tell you one more thing.
1457260	1460300	If you started teaching the fsir,
1461100	1462220	high level tfsir,
1462220	1463340	or you started teaching fiqh,
1463340	1465020	or you started teaching aqeedah, or whatever,
1465020	1466780	you started these classes and courses,
1466780	1467740	how many people show up?
1469020	1469580	Five people?
1470540	1471980	That becomes three people?
1471980	1473500	That is just the Imam and his best friend?
1475180	1477100	And then there's a wedding the next weekend and then,
1478380	1480380	you know, it's just tarakuqa qa'ima,
1480380	1481260	they just leave you alone.
1481820	1483500	All these people don't even want an education.
1483500	1484700	They don't want to learn anything.
1484700	1486300	Well, they don't want to learn anything
1486300	1489100	because the first two steps aren't in place.
1489740	1491420	When those steps are in place,
1491420	1493180	by the way, the people who will seriously learn
1493180	1494860	it will never be a large population.
1494860	1495980	The people who will seriously learn
1495980	1499180	will always be a smaller population, right?
1499180	1502460	Because you can't expect that high level of commitment
1502460	1503100	from everybody.
1503740	1506540	In fact, that wasn't even expected from all the sahaba.
1506540	1508380	Not all the sahaba were learning all the time.
1508380	1509260	There were people in,
1509820	1510060	you know,
1510060	1511580	oh, they were on the sofa.
1512620	1513420	They were subset.
1513980	1515020	They were not everyone.
1515020	1516540	Everyone had other responsibilities.
1517180	1519660	So there will be some learning that happens
1519660	1521580	and happens more exclusively.
1521580	1523180	So you shouldn't guilt yourself.
1523180	1524380	That's the other thing about this.
1524380	1525500	You shouldn't guilt yourself
1525500	1527260	that you're not engaged in higher learning.
1527260	1528700	And until you do higher learning
1528700	1530460	and you become a sheikh yourself or,
1530460	1533260	you know, you leave society and go sit under a tree
1533260	1535420	to learn some classical texts,
1535420	1536620	then you're not a good Muslim.
1536620	1539340	No, that's not the point.
1540140	1542380	The point is the few who do learn,
1542380	1544300	their responsibility becomes to teach.
1545180	1545740	Everyone else.
1545740	1547020	And the Quran talks about that too.
1547020	1548380	Allah talks about that too.
1548380	1549340	But I will now,
1549340	1551100	in our next session after your break,
1551100	1552220	I'm going to dedicate our time
1552220	1554380	talking about Al-Kitab particularly.
1554380	1555500	And I'm going to share some things with you
1555500	1556940	Al-Kitab and then Al-Hikmah
