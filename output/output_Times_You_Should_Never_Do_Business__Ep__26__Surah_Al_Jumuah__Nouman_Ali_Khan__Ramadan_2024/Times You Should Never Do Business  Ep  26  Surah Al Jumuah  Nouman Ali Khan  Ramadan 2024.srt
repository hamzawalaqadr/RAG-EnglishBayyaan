00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
in the Quran JustinBakara. That's it. That's it.

39
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,200
Once the fasting is mentioned,

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,540
that's it. That's the comprehensive place for fasting.

41
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,500
You may have some side references to people who fast

42
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,420
but it's not talking about fasting itself.

43
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,320
Anyway...

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,140

you should make extra precautions and you should dress better

48
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,180

لقد أعملت للمنزل المنزل للمنزل المنزل للمنزل المنزل

175
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,180
إذا كانت المنزل يريد أن تتعرض كل منزل المنزل

176
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,180
سيأخذ فقط المنزلنا لكي يكون 50% من المنزل

177
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,180
ويوجد شيء يسمى مدينة مدينة

178
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,180
where you have to call different companies

179
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,180
and say hi, I'm coming, I'm coming

180
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,180
and they'll say I hope you die today

181
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,180
and they'll just say the meanest things

182
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,180
I just slammed the phone on you

183
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
or hold on, hold on, hold on

184
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:10,180
so it was an average of 300-400 calls a day

185
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,180
which means about 350 insults a day

186
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,180
and then one person says maybe send me a fax

187
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,180
so that would be

188
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,180
but what makes all of that pain worth it

189
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,180
if you make one sale and you're like

190
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,180
yeah, then you're high-fiving everybody

191
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,180
now imagine, let's just take my scenario

192
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,180
I'm making all these calls

193
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,180
all these customers are slamming their phone on me

194
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
cursing me out, insulting me

195
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,180
and this one customer after a thousand phone calls

196
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,180
says really, how many do you have?

197
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,180
how many total do you have?

198
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,180
50, only 50

199
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,180
can you see if you can get more?

200
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,180
and then I look at the clock

201
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,180
and the clock says it's Friday

202
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,180
and it's 12.30

203
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
and the clock is going to start at 1.15

204
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,180
and in 15 minutes to get to the Juma prayer

205
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,180
and now I'm like

206
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
yeah, hold on

207
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
and I'm like I can still make it

208
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,180
and now it's 1 o'clock

209
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
I'm still working on this sale

210
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
I can still make it

211
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,180
I can still 1.05

212
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,180
okay, I'll catch the first part of the clock

213
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,180
but I'll still catch it

214
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,180
and I'm trying not to make this sale go away

215
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,180
because I don't know if I'm going to get this chance again

216
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,180
but if this was

217
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,180
I hate you

218
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,180
never call here again

219
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,180
I'm going to call the police

220
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,180
I'm going to find out where you live

221
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,180
et cetera, et cetera

222
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,180
if those are the calls I'm getting

223
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,180
I'm going to go to Juma early

224
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
you understand?

225
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,180
but if I'm getting the sale

226
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
then I'm going to be like

227
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,180
hold on

228
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,180
I mean let me just

229
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,180
I had an old friend

230
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,180
who was in the wholesale business

231
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,180
and he told me that he had one customer

232
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,180
that would call him at 1 o'clock

233
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
because he knows he leaves at 1.05

234
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,180
for Juma

235
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,180
he called him 1 o'clock

236
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,180
every Friday to make a big sale

237
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,180
and he'd say it's Friday

238
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,180
I gotta go

239
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,180
oh yeah yeah yeah

240
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,180
sorry

241
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,180
and then

242
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
let it come back

243
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
and then next week

244
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
1 o'clock I've got a really big deal

245
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
it's got a

246
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,180
we only have

247
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,180
the next 30 minutes

248
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,180
I'm going to need you

249
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
no, you're not going to need me

250
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm going to leave in 5 minutes

251
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,180
because it's Friday

252
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
every week

253
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
his customers name was Sheypan

254
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,180
uh

255
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,180
uh

256
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,180
uh

257
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
uh

258
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Dave the Devil

259
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,180
anyway

260
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,180
the Allah mentioned

261
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,180
the most lucrative part

262
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,180
of work

263
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,180
the sale

264
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,180
the sale represents

265
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,180
when you make the money

266
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
the sale represents

267
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
when you make the profit

268
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
the sale represents

269
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
when all of your hard work

270
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,180
finally bears fruit

271
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
the thing that you've been working for

272
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
all along

273
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,180
and even if that is happening

274
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
at the time of the Friday prayer

275
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
walk away from it

276
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
all the other things

277
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
walking away from that

278
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
is easy

279
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,180
the hardest thing to walk away from

280
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
is

281
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,180
the sale

282
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,180
that's the hardest thing to walk away from

283
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
and the sale is not just

284
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
if you're in business

285
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,180
if you have a

286
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,180
if you applied for a job

287
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,180
and nobody calls you back

288
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,180
and the one call you got back

289
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
for an interview

290
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,180
is right as you're walking into the

291
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,180
for the

292
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,180
for the

293
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180
right

294
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
and now hey

295
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,180
we'd like to talk to you about this

296
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
opportunity

297
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,180
we have 30 other candidates

298
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,180
but we think you're a good fit

299
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
sorry I got to go pray

300
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
and you hang up

301
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,180
that's not easy is it

302
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
that's not easy

303
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,180
because this is

304
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,180
this was the sale

305
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,180
this was the sale

306
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,180
Allah mentioned the sale for a reason

307
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,180
because human beings are tempted

308
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,180
by the prospect of making money

309
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,180
making profit

310
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
and Allah says

311
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
that's what I want you to leave

312
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,180
for these few hours

313
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,180
and then he said

314
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,180
but you say

315
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,180
these few

316
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,180
if I leave that

317
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
then how am I going to make my money

318
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Allah says

319
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
that

320
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,180
that is in fact

321
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
better for you

322
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,180
guys sorry for the interruption

323
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,180
in the middle of this lecture

324
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,180
just before you continue

325
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,180
I want to let you know

326
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,180
and encourage you

327
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,180
that I want you to sign up

328
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180

329

worldwide communities of students

334
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,180
that are studying the meanings

335
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,180
and the benefit

336
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,180
and the wisdom of the Quran

337
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,180
and are in shall Allah

338
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,180
spreading that in their own circles

339
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,180
thanks so much

340
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,180
I am telling you

341
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,180
that's better for you

342
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
you will have to trust me

343
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
Allah is now

344
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,180
asking us to sacrifice

345
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,180
benefits of this life

346
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,180
you know money profit

347
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,180
business deals

348
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,180
he's asking this to sacrifice

349
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
them

350
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,180
because he's promising us

351
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,180
trust me

352
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,180
I'm going to give you something

353
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,180
that's better than that

354
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,180
in

355
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,180
if in fact

356
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
you know that for a fact

357
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
if you really do believe

358
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,180
in what Allah is telling you

359
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,180
if you really know

360
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,180
then you'll realize

361
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
that what Allah is calling

362
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
you to is much better

363
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180
wasn't there

364
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
leave the sale

365
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,180
let it go

366
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,180
now

367
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,180
it's unfortunately

368
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,180
like this is the highest

369
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,180
temptation right

370
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
now we

371
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
when

372
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
when the nation becomes weak

373
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,180
you don't even need

374
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
the highest temptation

375
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,180
you know

376
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
you just need

377
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
hey man

378
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,180
I am

379
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,180
not at my save point

380
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,180
in my game yet

381
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,180
hold on

382
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,180
let me get to the next save point

383
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,180
and then

384
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,180
I don't want to hit pause right now

385
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,180
or there's only one more

386
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,180
episode left in the season

387
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
let me finish the episode

388
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
so that I can

389
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,180
properly do the good

390
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,180
so I'm not doing

391
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
the good of

392
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,180
what happened with the villain

393
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,180
right

394
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,180
like stupid things

395
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,180
to not

396
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
go and pray

397
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,180
you know

398
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
oh I don't understand

399
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:48,180
لا أفهم ما يحدث في الخدبة. لا أفهم اللغة. أوه الخدبة يسعر. لا أفهمها. لا أفهم شيء منها.

400
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,180
Who cares about your feelings?

401
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Unless Ed, when it's called, go. When it's called for, go. That's why you're going.

402
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:04,180
The flip side of that is a conversation not with the attendees of the Friday Prayer, but the deliverers of the خدبة.

403
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,180
The خدبة is supposed to be something that inspires. The خدبة is supposed to be something that brings hearts closer to Allah.

404
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:16,180
It's supposed to be something that lives up to the spirit of يطلع عليهما ياته ويزكيه.

405
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:25,180
I have to have in my mind as a خطيب something that is there, that is dirtying the hearts or dirtying society or dirtying the minds.

406
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,180
Somehow I have to share something that will clean a little bit of that up from the word of Allah.

407
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,180
And I can't do that if I don't know what the pollution is.

408
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:41,180
So I have to now have conversations with my congregants, people, and say, hey, what's happening?

409
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,180
What are you suffering from? What's going on? What's happening in the family? What's happening in the community?

410
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,180
What's happening in the businesses? What's happening among our youth? What's happening among our seniors?

411
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,180
And then now I can find something in Allah's Book and say, you know what?

412
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,180
Here, Allah is helping you clean this problem. Right? يطلع عليهما ياته.

413
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,180
So the خطب is, you say, how do you give a خطب that's relevant?

414
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:09,180
When you give a خطب that's relevant, Allah's Book is a set of solutions, is a set of purifying reminders.

415
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:16,180
But if you don't know who you're giving the reminder to, if you don't have an appreciation of who you're talking to

416
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,180
when you guys come up to me and you ask me questions, right?

417
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,180
I spend an hour trying to teach you something.

418
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,180
Then those 10-15 minutes, you're teaching me something.

419
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,180
I'm learning from you. What's going on with you?

420
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,180
What confusions do you have? What questions do you have?

421
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,180
What plagues you? What's hurting?

422
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,180
And many of the things you ask me, I don't have an answer.

423
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,180
I just don't have an answer.

424
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,180
But at least I know the questions, though, that I must seek out the answers in the last book.

425
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,180
It's like you're giving me homework assignments.

426
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
You understand?

427
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:54,180
So the job of the ممبر, the خطب is actually supposed to be that

428
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,180
so people can see how the Qur'an cleanses what is going on in society.

429
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,180
It cleanses what's happening in the lives of people.

430
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,180
So وَذَا نُنْ بَيْدَالِكُمْ خَيْرُوا الَّكُمْ يِنْ كُنْ تُنْ تَعْنَمُونَ

431
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:11,180
Now, a couple of places in the Qur'an that I really want you to see in connection with this idea of leaving the sail.

432
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,180
One is, of course, when you're leaving the sail, you're leaving profit, right?

433
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,180
But Allah says in another place in the Qur'an, سُتُرْبَقْرَ, He says

434
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,180
وَمِنَا نَاسِمَنْ يَشْرِينَ فِسَهُبْ تِرَاءَ اَمَرْضَاتِ الدَّا

435
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Among people, there's someone who sells himself to please Allah.

436
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:35,180
You left the sail, but actually you're selling yourself to Allah.

437
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,180
Allah is the purchaser now.

438
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,180
Allah becomes the customer.

439
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,180
You become the product that's being sold.

440
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,180
إن الله هشترامي دا مُلِدِدَا وَنْ فُسَهُمْ وَأَنْ وَادَهُمْ

441
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
بِيَنَّذَهُمْ وَجَنَّةً.

442
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,180
Allah has purchased from believers their money and their wealth, their lives in exchange for Jannah.

443
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,180
Then, of course, we have Friday, but the Israelites before us, which day did they have?

444
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,180
They have Saturday.

445
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:02,180
And we shouldn't mess up Friday the way they messed up with Saturday.

446
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,180
So maybe we should know how did they mess up with Saturday?

447
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,180
Because that will help us learn how to not mess up Friday.

448
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,180
So إن سُلْتُ العَرَفِ إِذْقَالَةُمَّةُمَّةُمْ مِنْهُمْ لِمَ تَعِظُونَ قَوْمَنْ

449
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,180
اللَّهُمُ مُغْلِكُهُمْ.

450
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,180
This is the day of the Sabbath, the day of Saturday.

451
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,180
They were supposed to not fish.

452
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,180
And they used to be حاضرة البحر.

453
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,180
The Qur'an says they were right on the edge of us.

454
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,180
There was a sea town.

455
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,180
It was a beach town, or it was a port town.

456
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,180
So their income, primary income was fishing.

457
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,180
So they would fish every day of the week, and there would be no fish.

458
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,180
And then the day of Saturday, the fish would come near the shore,

459
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,180
and they would do flipping summer salts.

460
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,180
And jump up in the air and go back down.

461
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,180
They would come and jump up and down in front of them.

462
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,180
And they were like, the one day it's حرام, it jumps up and down.

463
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,180
And every other day, they're gone.

464
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,180
You can't find them, right?

465
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,180
So what they decided to do, according to some of us,

466
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
because the Qur'an doesn't spell it out,

467
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:13,180
but the idea, what they decided to do was leave a net on Friday night

468
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,180
and pick it up on Sunday morning.

469
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,180
And then when the fish come, they get caught in it.

470
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Or they go whole, and when the waves come and the fish reach the shore,

471
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,180
when they're about to go back, they fall into the hole.

472
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,180
So they're like, I mean, we did do the work, technically.

473
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
We weren't thinking about that.

474
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,180
And what are we learning?

475
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,180
They tried to find technical loopholes.

476
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,180
Now, if you want to save money on taxes,

477
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,180
people look for technical loopholes, right?

478
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,180
Lawyers find technical loopholes.

479
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,180
Because that's what the law says.

480
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,180
I didn't technically do anything wrong.

481
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,180
But Allah, as I would have said,

482
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,180
then says, when you play games like that with the less law,

483
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,180
because there's the letter of the law, there's also what?

484
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,180
So even if they weren't violating the letter,

485
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,180
they were definitely violating the spirit.

486
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
Because even as you hear this, you're like,

487
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,180
well, technically, they didn't do anything wrong.

488
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,180
No, not technically, but spiritually they did, didn't they?

489
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,180
And so Allah said, there were people among them who said,

490
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
don't do this.

491
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,180
Don't violate the Sabbath.

492
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,180
It's a sacred day.

493
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
Allah has told us not to do this.

494
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,180
And they said,

495
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,180
اف قالة أمتو منه ولم تعدون قومن الله

496
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,180
ومودي كومن أو معذبهم عذاب وشديده.

497
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,180
So they were divided into three groups.

498
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,180
One group that was violating the Saturday.

499
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,180
One group that was trying to say, come on, don't do this.

500
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,180
And a third group that says,

501
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Hey, why are you giving them advice?

502
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,180
Allah is going to destroy these people.

503
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,180
Look at them.

504
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
They don't even obey the word of Allah.

505
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
Allah will annihilate them.

506
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,180
And you know, Allah will destroy them, kill them.

507
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,180
أول عذبهم عذاب وشديده.

508
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,180
Or are you going to punish them in some terrible way?

509
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,180
You should get away from these sinful Muslims.

510
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
They're lost.

511
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,180
They're lost cause.

512
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
قالوا الله عزيلا تاني الرب إلى ربكم.

513
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,180
ولعندهم يتطلون.

514
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
They said there's two reasons we can try to advise them.

515
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,180
One, at least we will have an excuse before your rub.

516
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,180
Meaning Muslims should not abandon other Muslims.

517
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,180
We should still try to lovingly counter each other.

518
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,180
Lovingly.

519
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,180
لما تعدون قومن.

520
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
This ayah has so many lessons, man.

521
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,180
So here you have people that are openly doing Haram.

522
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
And another group is trying to advise them.

523
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,180
And the word used as well.

524
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,180
وعذبهم يتطلون.

525
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
وعذبهم يتطلون.

526
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
وعذبهم يتطلون.

527
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
وعذبهم يتطلون.

528
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
وعذبهم يتطلون.

529
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,180
So apparently they're not making tweets about these Muslims.

530
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,180
Apparently they're not making YouTube videos refuting these Muslims.

531
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,180
That are violating the Sabbaths.

532
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
Apparently they're not declaring them kuffar.

533
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,180
They're gently lovingly advising them.

534
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Because when you attack them.

535
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,180
And when you critique them.

536
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,180
And when you say Allah will destroy them.

537
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
And when you say Allah will destroy you.

538
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,180
You kuffar.

539
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,180
You heedens.

540
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,180
You this and you that.

541
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,180
That you are only building more hatred in their hearts towards you.

542
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,180
And your hearts towards them.

543
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,180
And الله فا بين أقولوبكم.

544
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,180
الله قد love between your hearts.

545
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,180
Goes away.

546
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,180
Those people that are even the people that are doing the worst Haram things.

547
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
Somewhere in there they say.

548
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
They say.

549
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
They say.

550
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Somewhere there's some glimmer of light that you might be able to reach.

551
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
If Allah told Musa to talk to Pharaoh.

552
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
And nicely.

553
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
قول الله قول الني.

554
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
And Allah says.

555
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,180
أذلت دعال المبينين.

556
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,180
We have to be humble before other believers.

557
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
And here in this I.L.

558
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
One group said.

559
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Don't worry about these people.

560
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,180
Allah is going to destroy them.

561
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,180
These were the people on Twitter.

562
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Right.

563
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,180
And the other group said.

564
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,180
No.

565
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,180
No.

566
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
We should talk to them in a dignified way.

567
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Maybe they'll come back.

568
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,180
They'll come back.

569
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
They'll come back.

570
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Why are you saying you're hopeless?

571
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,180
فا لما رسول الله فا يبكيروا به.

572
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,180
And when they forgot what they were reminded of.

573
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
الله says.

574
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,180
نجينا النذينة ينهون عن السور.

575
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,180
We rescued those who used to stop from doing wrong.

576
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,180
الله only rescued one group.

577
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,180
The group that was concerned.

578
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
They got rescued.

579
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,180
Then he says.

580
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,180
و أخذنا النذينة اللهم و بعذابين بئيس.

581
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
And those who did wrong.

582
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
We grabbed them with a terrible punishment.

583
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
Now the question became.

584
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
Who was the one who did wrong?

585
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,180
There were two opinions among the Sahaba.

586
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,180
Because Allah didn't say openly who did wrong.

587
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,180
There could be two wrong parties here.

588
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,180
The people who were fishing on Saturday.

589
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,180
And the people who didn't care about them.

590
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,180
Because apparently that's also wrong.

591
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,180
So some Sahaba said it doesn't include both.

592
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
Some Sahaba said it doesn't include both.

593
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180
I'm more inclined to believe it includes both.

594
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
Because Allah mentioned three groups.

595
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
But then reduced them to two.

596
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,180
So it's not like he's silent on the third one.

597
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Like you figure it out.

598
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,180
But actually it seems like.

599
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,180
And previously they said.

600
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,180
و أعزيراتهم يداربكم.

601
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,180
At least we will have an excuse.

602
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,180
Which is to say they won't have an excuse.

603
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
You know.

604
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,180
So this is the.

605
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,180
The.

606
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,180
The.

607
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
The.

608
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
The.

609
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,180
The.

610
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,180
The.

611
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
The.

612
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180

The.

615
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,180
The.

616
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
The.

617
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,180
The.

618
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,180

619
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,180

The.

621
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,180
The.

622
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,180
The.

623
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,180
The.

624
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,180
The.

625
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
The.

626
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
The.

627
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
The.

00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,180
The.

00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,180
The.

ما هو يفعله؟

659
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
يجب أن يجدك أكثر من ما يمكنك أن تفهم

660
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,660
يجب أن يضع برقة ويشارك

661
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660

الناس

686
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,820
their wife depended on the husband for finances

687
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,660
and if she gets divorced

688
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,820
she gonna provide for herself

689
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,660
parents are old

690
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,660
or some other situations

691
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
so the participating might come with a lot of financial losses

692
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
or the husband has to pay

693
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,900
for the

694
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,220
for the talk to happen

695
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,660
for the money to be paid

696
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,960
إليكم الجن臥سيارaren علىوحه و we think of our spouse as an

697
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,140
If now in my toolkit I am not sitting with my determinant

698
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,940
And all this is very hard

699
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,940
فلنحن نحن نحن نحن بحاجة لتحديث سلطة طلاق one day that's gonna get me in trouble anyway

700
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,940
so so now from عام تخاص this is an interesting point i mean actually this

701
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:02,060
what he makes it is um it is to see it i'll simplify this for you um you know if if someone in this

702
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:09,500
group said something bad or did something mean i have two choices i could say

703
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,500
this one yeah and then i could point it yeah but i could just

704
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,900
expose him and what he did and what he said and all of it or i could say it would be nicer

705
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,980
it would be kind if all of us could be a little more patient with each other and we could just

706
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,020
you know sit respectfully and etc and not speak during the general i etc in other words i didn't

707
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:39,020
point it out directly i kept it general so the person who was being talked to can take the hint

708
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,300
other people can benefit too but nobody got embarrassed do you understand when unless

709
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:50,140
i i'll you there were some people this is this i these iot came in the incident of an event where

710
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,540
people actually didn't show up to جما the way they were supposed to and some people walked away

711
00:28:54,540 --> 00:29:00,300
from جما that's the context and in that context i could have pointed out those people and said you

712
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,500
shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have done this and you shouldn't have done this but

713
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,340
الله has just opened it up in general those of you who have faith or claim to have faith when the call is made

714
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,700
rush to the remembrance of الله leave the sail that's better for you it's positive reinforcement isn't it

715
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,300
and then he says and when the prayer is done فا يدى قدية تسعنة let's talk about قباء

716
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:29,340
there's two words in Arabic that are really cool قباء and أداق قباء and أداق so قدائ تنفر

717
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,980
قدائ تنفر which actually means the same thing i fulfilled my duty i fulfilled my duty but what happened

718
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,980
in islamic culture and literature is we say if you prayed your prayer on time at daytaha

719
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,060
and if you prayed it later that it becomes a قباء but actually originally they mean the same

720
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:53,260
thing that and قباء actually technically need the same thing okay now what does this word actually

721
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,940
mean it means to give a decision someone called means a deadly poison to finish something to

722
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,300
end something to be done with something like if you finish a product or project then you did

723
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,900
قداء of the project you completed it and you no longer owe any obligations or sometimes your boss

724
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,580
says if you finish this task then you can leave before five o'clock right or your parents

725
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,820
you're to a child they say finish your homework as soon as you finish then you can play video games

726
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:26,540
but not before so the moment they're done he's like قدائ تقديق

727
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:35,020
okay it's done i don't owe this anymore i finished this obligation which means i am set free okay

728
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:40,060
the idea of قداء also it is used in the payment of debts when you pay a debt you're free

729
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:47,340
so now Allah is using the term قدية تصلا when the when the prayer has been given its due

730
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,460
when the payment has been made meaning you owe Allah this prayer you owe Allah this prayer

731
00:30:54,540 --> 00:31:02,460
و when that payment is made فن تشيروف الارضي i love this iya spread out in the land go everywhere

732
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,580
the Israelites were told to remain confined in home they couldn't spread out

733
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,740
Allah tells us finish the Friday prayer and spread out go everywhere spread out everywhere

734
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,660
what does that mean spread out everywhere you just got inspired by the word of Allah

735
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:24,220
then you went to the university then some of you went back to the office some of you went to the store

736
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,620
some of you went and continued to drive your hooldware some of you whatever you do

737
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,380
you went back to the restaurant to work you went to hang out with your friends some of you went back home

738
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,500
wherever you went back what did you take with you

739
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,580
you took a little bit of light with you

740
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,500
Allah wants that light to spread everywhere Allah wants the impact of what happened inside the

741
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:51,740
مشد to affect society outside the مشد so he says is it beauty the wildest iron is hot

742
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:57,260
when the heat is intense when the light is hot it is intense go spread it everywhere

743
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,740
spread out everywhere and you will you will bring this light to your office

744
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,220
to your you know it's not like you're going to go and say okay okay i'm at the office

745
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,180
time for me to give the خبا now no no no it's not the point isn't you're going to go give the

746
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:17,500
sermon but now that you're you you heard a خبا about honesty and you go back and your your manager

747
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,020
wants you to lie about a project no no we're not going to lie about it we can do this in a way that

748
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,980
has integrity and you stand up by what's right because you carried some light back with you

749
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,780
you're about to cheat on your exam with some friends and you say no no no Allah is watching

750
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,540
i just heard a خبا about the تفوى of الله i'm not going to violate the تفوى 20 minutes later

751
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,500
i'm not going to do that guys we're not going to cheat i don't care what happens we're not cheating

752
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:47,900
we're not using this cheat sheet etc etc okay no bribery no cheating no violation you know or you

753
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,900
are the خبا about your family the خبا about the rights of the family

754
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,540
if you can pardon overlook you know sometimes you have an argument with your family one argument

755
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,820
that happened six months ago but you bring it up over and over again and beat it over the head

756
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:11,660
or Allah says if you can forgive and overlook and move on that Allah is forgiving and you go home and

757
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:18,780
you see the person's face and you're like i so want to do this right now the food won't taste

758
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:23,900
as spicy if i don't do this this is some people need ketchup with their food other people need

759
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,860
comments with their food how am i going to make this food taste good without the comments and you just

760
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:36,140
heard the خبا and you're like food tastes good feels good you you took it with you

761
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:43,580
فانتشيرو فلنو go spread out and that he says what tell women from the night even more beautiful words

762
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:50,220
he says pursue out of Allah's favor Allah's favor here actually means that his

763
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:58,300
go make money go make money go seek opportunity go travel to a new place

764
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,260
go learn this is all the father of Allah how do we know this is the father of Allah

765
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,260
الله uses this word father in the concept of the context of the

766
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,260
he says there's no harm if you pursue

767
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,660
فضل from your when you're at the meaning people come to the from all over the world right

768
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,900
so they would bring this one would bring their clothes from this place and this one

769
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,260
the blankets and this one will bring rugs and they're selling it to each other in

770
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,300
import export business isn't it and they're making some money when they're at that's called from

771
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:36,140
الله now says hey you left the bay here you left the sale and you came to me now go and I will

772
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,820
give you extra what's the word for extra فضل I will give you more than what you expected

773
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,860
go look for that though it won't come to you you have to go after it you can't say when is the

774
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:54,780
father level coming will be the oh pursue pursue out of the father level love pursue every opportunity

775
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,980
you can and the min also means you might see a glimpse of the father and you capture it

776
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,940
you see a small opportunity and you'll take full advantage you know in sports for example in

777
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,900
strategic sports you're when you're when you're you know facing an opponent when you're when the

778
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,700
offense you look for a small opening when you look for that small opening that becomes your

779
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,900
strategic you know avenue to score the goal or to hit the knockout punch or whatever right

780
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,500
that that's small opportunity you see it as a big opportunity and this mentality

781
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,700
وفتاقو من فضل دا means oh no no the door's not wide open so there's nothing happening

782
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,500
hold on the door is this much open it's half an inch open you should you should see that as

783
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,500
ابترا من فضل دا it's not even the full father level lights من فضل دا it's from the open

784
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,340
the opportunity given by Allah from the favor given to from Allah that's there and now you must pursue

785
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:52,300
that gap wider you must you must take full advantage of that opportunity so let's

786
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,860
is what that will mean فضل دا isn't it beautiful that the most spiritual lesson is being

787
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:02,220
complement complemented with material gain and what was this I used for the already didn't it

788
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,540
will follow the Quran the revelation the cleansing that was the father level

789
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:18,700
now this is also the father level the best of the internal and the best of the external

790
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,900
you know there's the the the internal the the the the bottom is being cleansed by the word of

791
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:30,700
الله that's the father level and the external now you can pursue حلال you know income you can

792
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,420
seek the father level and by the way after coming out of the prayer you're going to live by the law of

793
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,820
الله which means you're going to pursue حلال right and that's really what's going to bring

794
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,700
and then look at that why did you go to جمع prayer what was the goal

795
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:57,020
remembering الله the goal was جمع is done go go back to work go back to university go back home

796
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:02,380
go back to whatever work you were doing and الله says what good Allah if you remember Allah a lot

797
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,180
wait i thought the remembrance part was done when i went to

798
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:14,620
جمع now it's party time it's friday night y'all but he says no now remember Allah

799
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,820
a lot now we're learning two dimensions of ذكر there's ذكر

800
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,220
there's ذكر when you're when you're praying there's ذكر when you're in جمع there's ذكر when

801
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,420
you're sitting in a lecture there's ذكر when you're reciting Quran that's ذكر there's another ذكر

802
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,420
there's ذكر when you're sitting in the library young man and it's ذكر when you're sitting in the library

803
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:44,300
studying and she walked by it you didn't look up that was ذكر of الله there was ذكر when

804
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,660
you could see the next person's answer and you know you're not ready for this test and you didn't look

805
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,260
that was also what that was ذكر of الله that was ذكر of الله

806
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,940
you're you're you're selling meat and you could put more bones in it than the meat

807
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,660
because the customer can't see it but you didn't you put more meat

808
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,420
and you could give them good meat or you could give them more of the most of the fat

809
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,980
you could do that too but you didn't because you did what ذكر of الله that's ذكر of الله

810
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:21,420
students ask i want to do something i want to remember Allah yeah remember Allah carry yourself
