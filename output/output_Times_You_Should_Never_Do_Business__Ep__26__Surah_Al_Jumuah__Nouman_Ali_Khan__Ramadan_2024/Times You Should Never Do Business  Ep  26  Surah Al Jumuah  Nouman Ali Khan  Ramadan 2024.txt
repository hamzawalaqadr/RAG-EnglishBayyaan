جميعًا التمر allahWithMan ...The肩انور... The fasting of Ramadan is not mentioned any other time

Once the fasting is mentioned,

You may have some side references to people who fast
but it's not talking about fasting itself.

ويوجد شيء يسمى مدينة مدينة
where you have to call different companies
and say hi, I'm coming, I'm coming
and they'll say I hope you die today
and they'll just say the meanest things
I just slammed the phone on you
or hold on, hold on, hold on
so it was an average of 300-400 calls a day
which means about 350 insults a day
and then one person says maybe send me a fax
so that would be
but what makes all of that pain worth it
if you make one sale and you're like
yeah, then you're high-fiving everybody
now imagine, let's just take my scenario
I'm making all these calls
all these customers are slamming their phone on me
cursing me out, insulting me
and this one customer after a thousand phone calls
says really, how many do you have?
how many total do you have?
50, only 50
can you see if you can get more?
and then I look at the clock
and the clock says it's Friday
and it's 12.30
and the clock is going to start at 1.15
and in 15 minutes to get to the Juma prayer
and now I'm like
yeah, hold on
and I'm like I can still make it
and now it's 1 o'clock
I'm still working on this sale
I can still make it
I can still 1.05
okay, I'll catch the first part of the clock
but I'll still catch it
and I'm trying not to make this sale go away
because I don't know if I'm going to get this chance again
but if this was
I hate you
never call here again
I'm going to call the police
I'm going to find out where you live
et cetera, et cetera
if those are the calls I'm getting
I'm going to go to Juma early
you understand?
but if I'm getting the sale
then I'm going to be like
hold on
I mean let me just
I had an old friend
who was in the wholesale business
and he told me that he had one customer
that would call him at 1 o'clock
because he knows he leaves at 1.05
for Juma
he called him 1 o'clock
every Friday to make a big sale
and he'd say it's Friday
I gotta go
oh yeah yeah yeah
sorry
and then
let it come back
and then next week
1 o'clock I've got a really big deal
it's got a
we only have
the next 30 minutes
I'm going to need you
no, you're not going to need me
I'm going to leave in 5 minutes
because it's Friday
every week
his customers name was Sheypan
uh
uh
uh
uh
Dave the Devil
anyway
the Allah mentioned
the most lucrative part
of work
the sale
the sale represents
when you make the money
the sale represents
when you make the profit
the sale represents
when all of your hard work
finally bears fruit
the thing that you've been working for
all along
and even if that is happening
at the time of the Friday prayer
walk away from it
all the other things
walking away from that
is easy
the hardest thing to walk away from
is
the sale
that's the hardest thing to walk away from
and the sale is not just
if you're in business
if you have a
if you applied for a job
and nobody calls you back
and the one call you got back
for an interview
is right as you're walking into the
for the
for the
right
and now hey
we'd like to talk to you about this
opportunity
we have 30 other candidates
but we think you're a good fit
sorry I got to go pray
and you hang up
that's not easy is it
that's not easy
because this is
this was the sale
this was the sale
Allah mentioned the sale for a reason
because human beings are tempted
by the prospect of making money
making profit
and Allah says
that's what I want you to leave
for these few hours
and then he said
but you say
these few
if I leave that
then how am I going to make my money
Allah says
that
that is in fact
better for you
guys sorry for the interruption
in the middle of this lecture
just before you continue
I want to let you know
and encourage you
that I want you to sign up
for bayanatv.com
and help other sign up
even sponsor students
for bayanatv.com
so we can create
worldwide communities of students
that are studying the meanings
and the benefit
and the wisdom of the Quran
and are in shall Allah
spreading that in their own circles
thanks so much
I am telling you
that's better for you
you will have to trust me
Allah is now
asking us to sacrifice
benefits of this life
you know money profit
business deals
he's asking this to sacrifice
them
because he's promising us
trust me
I'm going to give you something
that's better than that
in
if in fact
you know that for a fact
if you really do believe
in what Allah is telling you
if you really know
then you'll realize
that what Allah is calling
you to is much better
wasn't there
leave the sale
let it go
now
it's unfortunately
like this is the highest
temptation right
now we
when
when the nation becomes weak
you don't even need
the highest temptation
you know
you just need
hey man
I am
not at my save point
in my game yet
hold on
let me get to the next save point
and then
I don't want to hit pause right now
or there's only one more
episode left in the season
let me finish the episode
so that I can
properly do the good
so I'm not doing
the good of
what happened with the villain
right
like stupid things
to not
go and pray
you know
oh I don't understand
لا أفهم ما يحدث في الخدبة. لا أفهم اللغة. أوه الخدبة يسعر. لا أفهمها. لا أفهم شيء منها.
Who cares about your feelings?
Unless Ed, when it's called, go. When it's called for, go. That's why you're going.
The flip side of that is a conversation not with the attendees of the Friday Prayer, but the deliverers of the خدبة.
The خدبة is supposed to be something that inspires. The خدبة is supposed to be something that brings hearts closer to Allah.
It's supposed to be something that lives up to the spirit of يطلع عليهما ياته ويزكيه.
I have to have in my mind as a خطيب something that is there, that is dirtying the hearts or dirtying society or dirtying the minds.
Somehow I have to share something that will clean a little bit of that up from the word of Allah.
And I can't do that if I don't know what the pollution is.
So I have to now have conversations with my congregants, people, and say, hey, what's happening?
What are you suffering from? What's going on? What's happening in the family? What's happening in the community?
What's happening in the businesses? What's happening among our youth? What's happening among our seniors?
And then now I can find something in Allah's Book and say, you know what?
Here, Allah is helping you clean this problem. Right? يطلع عليهما ياته.
So the خطب is, you say, how do you give a خطب that's relevant?
When you give a خطب that's relevant, Allah's Book is a set of solutions, is a set of purifying reminders.
But if you don't know who you're giving the reminder to, if you don't have an appreciation of who you're talking to
when you guys come up to me and you ask me questions, right?
I spend an hour trying to teach you something.
Then those 10-15 minutes, you're teaching me something.
I'm learning from you. What's going on with you?
What confusions do you have? What questions do you have?
What plagues you? What's hurting?
And many of the things you ask me, I don't have an answer.
I just don't have an answer.
But at least I know the questions, though, that I must seek out the answers in the last book.
It's like you're giving me homework assignments.
You understand?
So the job of the ممبر, the خطب is actually supposed to be that
so people can see how the Qur'an cleanses what is going on in society.
It cleanses what's happening in the lives of people.
So وَذَا نُنْ بَيْدَالِكُمْ خَيْرُوا الَّكُمْ يِنْ كُنْ تُنْ تَعْنَمُونَ
Now, a couple of places in the Qur'an that I really want you to see in connection with this idea of leaving the sail.
One is, of course, when you're leaving the sail, you're leaving profit, right?
But Allah says in another place in the Qur'an, سُتُرْبَقْرَ, He says
وَمِنَا نَاسِمَنْ يَشْرِينَ فِسَهُبْ تِرَاءَ اَمَرْضَاتِ الدَّا
Among people, there's someone who sells himself to please Allah.
You left the sail, but actually you're selling yourself to Allah.
Allah is the purchaser now.
Allah becomes the customer.
You become the product that's being sold.
إن الله هشترامي دا مُلِدِدَا وَنْ فُسَهُمْ وَأَنْ وَادَهُمْ
بِيَنَّذَهُمْ وَجَنَّةً.
Allah has purchased from believers their money and their wealth, their lives in exchange for Jannah.
Then, of course, we have Friday, but the Israelites before us, which day did they have?
They have Saturday.
And we shouldn't mess up Friday the way they messed up with Saturday.
So maybe we should know how did they mess up with Saturday?
Because that will help us learn how to not mess up Friday.
So إن سُلْتُ العَرَفِ إِذْقَالَةُمَّةُمَّةُمْ مِنْهُمْ لِمَ تَعِظُونَ قَوْمَنْ
اللَّهُمُ مُغْلِكُهُمْ.
This is the day of the Sabbath, the day of Saturday.
They were supposed to not fish.
And they used to be حاضرة البحر.
The Qur'an says they were right on the edge of us.
There was a sea town.
It was a beach town, or it was a port town.
So their income, primary income was fishing.
So they would fish every day of the week, and there would be no fish.
And then the day of Saturday, the fish would come near the shore,
and they would do flipping summer salts.
And jump up in the air and go back down.
They would come and jump up and down in front of them.
And they were like, the one day it's حرام, it jumps up and down.
And every other day, they're gone.
You can't find them, right?
So what they decided to do, according to some of us,
because the Qur'an doesn't spell it out,
but the idea, what they decided to do was leave a net on Friday night
and pick it up on Sunday morning.
And then when the fish come, they get caught in it.
Or they go whole, and when the waves come and the fish reach the shore,
when they're about to go back, they fall into the hole.
So they're like, I mean, we did do the work, technically.
We weren't thinking about that.
And what are we learning?
They tried to find technical loopholes.
Now, if you want to save money on taxes,
people look for technical loopholes, right?
Lawyers find technical loopholes.
Because that's what the law says.
I didn't technically do anything wrong.
But Allah, as I would have said,
then says, when you play games like that with the less law,
because there's the letter of the law, there's also what?
So even if they weren't violating the letter,
they were definitely violating the spirit.
Because even as you hear this, you're like,
well, technically, they didn't do anything wrong.
No, not technically, but spiritually they did, didn't they?
And so Allah said, there were people among them who said,
don't do this.
Don't violate the Sabbath.
It's a sacred day.
Allah has told us not to do this.
And they said,
اف قالة أمتو منه ولم تعدون قومن الله
ومودي كومن أو معذبهم عذاب وشديده.
So they were divided into three groups.
One group that was violating the Saturday.
One group that was trying to say, come on, don't do this.
And a third group that says,
Hey, why are you giving them advice?
Allah is going to destroy these people.
Look at them.
They don't even obey the word of Allah.
Allah will annihilate them.
And you know, Allah will destroy them, kill them.
أول عذبهم عذاب وشديده.
Or are you going to punish them in some terrible way?
You should get away from these sinful Muslims.
They're lost.
They're lost cause.
قالوا الله عزيلا تاني الرب إلى ربكم.
ولعندهم يتطلون.
They said there's two reasons we can try to advise them.
One, at least we will have an excuse before your rub.
Meaning Muslims should not abandon other Muslims.
We should still try to lovingly counter each other.
Lovingly.
لما تعدون قومن.
This ayah has so many lessons, man.
So here you have people that are openly doing Haram.
And another group is trying to advise them.
And the word used as well.
وعذبهم يتطلون.
وعذبهم يتطلون.
وعذبهم يتطلون.
وعذبهم يتطلون.
وعذبهم يتطلون.
So apparently they're not making tweets about these Muslims.
Apparently they're not making YouTube videos refuting these Muslims.
That are violating the Sabbaths.
Apparently they're not declaring them kuffar.
They're gently lovingly advising them.
Because when you attack them.
And when you critique them.
And when you say Allah will destroy them.
And when you say Allah will destroy you.
You kuffar.
You heedens.
You this and you that.
That you are only building more hatred in their hearts towards you.
And your hearts towards them.
And الله فا بين أقولوبكم.
الله قد love between your hearts.
Goes away.
Those people that are even the people that are doing the worst Haram things.
Somewhere in there they say.
They say.
They say.
Somewhere there's some glimmer of light that you might be able to reach.
If Allah told Musa to talk to Pharaoh.
And nicely.
قول الله قول الني.
And Allah says.
أذلت دعال المبينين.
We have to be humble before other believers.
And here in this I.L.
One group said.
Don't worry about these people.
Allah is going to destroy them.
These were the people on Twitter.
Right.
And the other group said.
No.
No.
We should talk to them in a dignified way.
Maybe they'll come back.
They'll come back.
They'll come back.
Why are you saying you're hopeless?
فا لما رسول الله فا يبكيروا به.
And when they forgot what they were reminded of.
الله says.
نجينا النذينة ينهون عن السور.
We rescued those who used to stop from doing wrong.
الله only rescued one group.
The group that was concerned.
They got rescued.
Then he says.
و أخذنا النذينة اللهم و بعذابين بئيس.
And those who did wrong.
We grabbed them with a terrible punishment.
Now the question became.
Who was the one who did wrong?
There were two opinions among the Sahaba.
Because Allah didn't say openly who did wrong.
There could be two wrong parties here.
The people who were fishing on Saturday.
And the people who didn't care about them.
Because apparently that's also wrong.
So some Sahaba said it doesn't include both.
Some Sahaba said it doesn't include both.
I'm more inclined to believe it includes both.
Because Allah mentioned three groups.
But then reduced them to two.
So it's not like he's silent on the third one.
Like you figure it out.
But actually it seems like.
And previously they said.
و أعزيراتهم يداربكم.
At least we will have an excuse.
Which is to say they won't have an excuse.
You know.
So this is the.

If now in my toolkit I am not sitting with my determinant
And all this is very hard
فلنحن نحن نحن نحن بحاجة لتحديث سلطة طلاق one day that's gonna get me in trouble anyway
so so now from عام تخاص this is an interesting point i mean actually this
what he makes it is um it is to see it i'll simplify this for you um you know if if someone in this
group said something bad or did something mean i have two choices i could say
this one yeah and then i could point it yeah but i could just
expose him and what he did and what he said and all of it or i could say it would be nicer
it would be kind if all of us could be a little more patient with each other and we could just
you know sit respectfully and etc and not speak during the general i etc in other words i didn't
point it out directly i kept it general so the person who was being talked to can take the hint
other people can benefit too but nobody got embarrassed do you understand when unless
i i'll you there were some people this is this i these iot came in the incident of an event where
people actually didn't show up to جما the way they were supposed to and some people walked away
from جما that's the context and in that context i could have pointed out those people and said you
shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have done this and you shouldn't have done this but
الله has just opened it up in general those of you who have faith or claim to have faith when the call is made
rush to the remembrance of الله leave the sail that's better for you it's positive reinforcement isn't it
and then he says and when the prayer is done فا يدى قدية تسعنة let's talk about قباء
there's two words in Arabic that are really cool قباء and أداق قباء and أداق so قدائ تنفر
قدائ تنفر which actually means the same thing i fulfilled my duty i fulfilled my duty but what happened
in islamic culture and literature is we say if you prayed your prayer on time at daytaha
and if you prayed it later that it becomes a قباء but actually originally they mean the same
thing that and قباء actually technically need the same thing okay now what does this word actually
mean it means to give a decision someone called means a deadly poison to finish something to
end something to be done with something like if you finish a product or project then you did
قداء of the project you completed it and you no longer owe any obligations or sometimes your boss
says if you finish this task then you can leave before five o'clock right or your parents
you're to a child they say finish your homework as soon as you finish then you can play video games
but not before so the moment they're done he's like قدائ تقديق
okay it's done i don't owe this anymore i finished this obligation which means i am set free okay
the idea of قداء also it is used in the payment of debts when you pay a debt you're free
so now Allah is using the term قدية تصلا when the when the prayer has been given its due
when the payment has been made meaning you owe Allah this prayer you owe Allah this prayer
و when that payment is made فن تشيروف الارضي i love this iya spread out in the land go everywhere
the Israelites were told to remain confined in home they couldn't spread out
Allah tells us finish the Friday prayer and spread out go everywhere spread out everywhere
what does that mean spread out everywhere you just got inspired by the word of Allah
then you went to the university then some of you went back to the office some of you went to the store
some of you went and continued to drive your hooldware some of you whatever you do
you went back to the restaurant to work you went to hang out with your friends some of you went back home
wherever you went back what did you take with you
you took a little bit of light with you
Allah wants that light to spread everywhere Allah wants the impact of what happened inside the
مشد to affect society outside the مشد so he says is it beauty the wildest iron is hot
when the heat is intense when the light is hot it is intense go spread it everywhere
spread out everywhere and you will you will bring this light to your office
to your you know it's not like you're going to go and say okay okay i'm at the office
time for me to give the خبا now no no no it's not the point isn't you're going to go give the
sermon but now that you're you you heard a خبا about honesty and you go back and your your manager
wants you to lie about a project no no we're not going to lie about it we can do this in a way that
has integrity and you stand up by what's right because you carried some light back with you
you're about to cheat on your exam with some friends and you say no no no Allah is watching
i just heard a خبا about the تفوى of الله i'm not going to violate the تفوى 20 minutes later
i'm not going to do that guys we're not going to cheat i don't care what happens we're not cheating
we're not using this cheat sheet etc etc okay no bribery no cheating no violation you know or you
are the خبا about your family the خبا about the rights of the family
if you can pardon overlook you know sometimes you have an argument with your family one argument
that happened six months ago but you bring it up over and over again and beat it over the head
or Allah says if you can forgive and overlook and move on that Allah is forgiving and you go home and
you see the person's face and you're like i so want to do this right now the food won't taste
as spicy if i don't do this this is some people need ketchup with their food other people need
comments with their food how am i going to make this food taste good without the comments and you just
heard the خبا and you're like food tastes good feels good you you took it with you
فانتشيرو فلنو go spread out and that he says what tell women from the night even more beautiful words
he says pursue out of Allah's favor Allah's favor here actually means that his
go make money go make money go seek opportunity go travel to a new place
go learn this is all the father of Allah how do we know this is the father of Allah
الله uses this word father in the concept of the context of the
he says there's no harm if you pursue
فضل from your when you're at the meaning people come to the from all over the world right
so they would bring this one would bring their clothes from this place and this one
the blankets and this one will bring rugs and they're selling it to each other in
import export business isn't it and they're making some money when they're at that's called from
الله now says hey you left the bay here you left the sale and you came to me now go and I will
give you extra what's the word for extra فضل I will give you more than what you expected
go look for that though it won't come to you you have to go after it you can't say when is the
father level coming will be the oh pursue pursue out of the father level love pursue every opportunity
you can and the min also means you might see a glimpse of the father and you capture it
you see a small opportunity and you'll take full advantage you know in sports for example in
strategic sports you're when you're when you're you know facing an opponent when you're when the
offense you look for a small opening when you look for that small opening that becomes your
strategic you know avenue to score the goal or to hit the knockout punch or whatever right
that that's small opportunity you see it as a big opportunity and this mentality
وفتاقو من فضل دا means oh no no the door's not wide open so there's nothing happening
hold on the door is this much open it's half an inch open you should you should see that as
ابترا من فضل دا it's not even the full father level lights من فضل دا it's from the open
the opportunity given by Allah from the favor given to from Allah that's there and now you must pursue
that gap wider you must you must take full advantage of that opportunity so let's
is what that will mean فضل دا isn't it beautiful that the most spiritual lesson is being
complement complemented with material gain and what was this I used for the already didn't it
will follow the Quran the revelation the cleansing that was the father level
now this is also the father level the best of the internal and the best of the external
you know there's the the the internal the the the the bottom is being cleansed by the word of
الله that's the father level and the external now you can pursue حلال you know income you can
seek the father level and by the way after coming out of the prayer you're going to live by the law of
الله which means you're going to pursue حلال right and that's really what's going to bring

studying and she walked by it you didn't look up that was ذكر of الله there was ذكر when
