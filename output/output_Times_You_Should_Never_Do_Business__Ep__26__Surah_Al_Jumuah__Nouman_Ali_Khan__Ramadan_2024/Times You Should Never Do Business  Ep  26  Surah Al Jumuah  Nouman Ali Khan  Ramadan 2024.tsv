527180	530180	ويوجد شيء يسمى مدينة مدينة
530180	533180	where you have to call different companies
533180	535180	and say hi, I'm coming, I'm coming
535180	538180	and they'll say I hope you die today
538180	541180	and they'll just say the meanest things
541180	543180	I just slammed the phone on you
543180	545180	or hold on, hold on, hold on
545180	550180	so it was an average of 300-400 calls a day
550180	552180	which means about 350 insults a day
552180	558180	and then one person says maybe send me a fax
558180	561180	so that would be
561180	564180	but what makes all of that pain worth it
564180	566180	if you make one sale and you're like
566180	569180	yeah, then you're high-fiving everybody
569180	571180	now imagine, let's just take my scenario
571180	573180	I'm making all these calls
573180	575180	all these customers are slamming their phone on me
575180	577180	cursing me out, insulting me
577180	580180	and this one customer after a thousand phone calls
580180	583180	says really, how many do you have?
583180	585180	how many total do you have?
585180	588180	50, only 50
588180	590180	can you see if you can get more?
593180	596180	and then I look at the clock
596180	598180	and the clock says it's Friday
598180	600180	and it's 12.30
600180	602180	and the clock is going to start at 1.15
602180	605180	and in 15 minutes to get to the Juma prayer
605180	607180	and now I'm like
607180	608180	yeah, hold on
608180	610180	and I'm like I can still make it
610180	611180	and now it's 1 o'clock
611180	612180	I'm still working on this sale
612180	613180	I can still make it
613180	614180	I can still 1.05
614180	617180	okay, I'll catch the first part of the clock
617180	619180	but I'll still catch it
619180	623180	and I'm trying not to make this sale go away
623180	627180	because I don't know if I'm going to get this chance again
627180	629180	but if this was
629180	630180	I hate you
630180	631180	never call here again
631180	632180	I'm going to call the police
632180	634180	I'm going to find out where you live
634180	635180	et cetera, et cetera
635180	637180	if those are the calls I'm getting
637180	639180	I'm going to go to Juma early
639180	641180	you understand?
641180	643180	but if I'm getting the sale
643180	644180	then I'm going to be like
644180	645180	hold on
645180	646180	I mean let me just
646180	648180	I had an old friend
648180	651180	who was in the wholesale business
651180	654180	and he told me that he had one customer
654180	657180	that would call him at 1 o'clock
657180	659180	because he knows he leaves at 1.05
659180	660180	for Juma
660180	662180	he called him 1 o'clock
662180	665180	every Friday to make a big sale
665180	666180	and he'd say it's Friday
666180	667180	I gotta go
667180	668180	oh yeah yeah yeah
668180	669180	sorry
669180	671180	and then
671180	672180	let it come back
672180	673180	and then next week

703180	704180	of work
704180	706180	the sale
706180	707180	the sale represents
707180	708180	when you make the money

715180	717180	the thing that you've been working for

727180	728180	walking away from that
728180	729180	is easy
729180	731180	the hardest thing to walk away from
731180	732180	is
732180	733180	the sale
733180	735180	that's the hardest thing to walk away from
735180	736180	and the sale is not just
736180	737180	if you're in business
737180	738180	if you have a
738180	739180	if you applied for a job

766180	767180	this was the sale
767180	769180	this was the sale
769180	771180	Allah mentioned the sale for a reason
771180	773180	because human beings are tempted
773180	775180	by the prospect of making money
775180	776180	making profit
776180	777180	and Allah says
777180	778180	that's what I want you to leave

830180	831180	if in fact
831180	832180	you know that for a fact
832180	833180	if you really do believe
833180	835180	in what Allah is telling you
835180	836180	if you really know
836180	837180	then you'll realize
837180	838180	that what Allah is calling
838180	839180	you to is much better
839180	840180	wasn't there
840180	841180	leave the sale
842180	843180	let it go
843180	844180	now
844180	845180	it's unfortunately
845180	846180	like this is the highest
846180	847180	temptation right
847180	848180	now we
848180	849180	when
849180	850180	when the nation becomes weak
850180	851180	you don't even need
851180	852180	the highest temptation
852180	853180	you know
853180	854180	you just need
854180	855180	hey man
855180	856180	I am
856180	857180	not at my save point
857180	858180	in my game yet
859180	860180	hold on
860180	861180	let me get to the next save point
861180	862180	and then
862180	863180	I don't want to hit pause right now
863180	865180	or there's only one more
865180	866180	episode left in the season
866180	867180	let me finish the episode
867180	868180	so that I can
868180	869180	properly do the good
870180	871180	so I'm not doing
871180	872180	the good of
872180	873180	what happened with the villain
873180	874180	right
875180	876180	like stupid things
876180	877180	to not
877180	878180	go and pray
879180	880180	you know
880180	881180	oh I don't understand
881180	888180	لا أفهم ما يحدث في الخدبة. لا أفهم اللغة. أوه الخدبة يسعر. لا أفهمها. لا أفهم شيء منها.
888180	890180	Who cares about your feelings?
891180	897180	Unless Ed, when it's called, go. When it's called for, go. That's why you're going.
897180	904180	The flip side of that is a conversation not with the attendees of the Friday Prayer, but the deliverers of the خدبة.
904180	910180	The خدبة is supposed to be something that inspires. The خدبة is supposed to be something that brings hearts closer to Allah.
910180	916180	It's supposed to be something that lives up to the spirit of يطلع عليهما ياته ويزكيه.
916180	925180	I have to have in my mind as a خطيب something that is there, that is dirtying the hearts or dirtying society or dirtying the minds.
925180	930180	Somehow I have to share something that will clean a little bit of that up from the word of Allah.
930180	934180	And I can't do that if I don't know what the pollution is.
934180	941180	So I have to now have conversations with my congregants, people, and say, hey, what's happening?
941180	945180	What are you suffering from? What's going on? What's happening in the family? What's happening in the community?
945180	949180	What's happening in the businesses? What's happening among our youth? What's happening among our seniors?
949180	953180	And then now I can find something in Allah's Book and say, you know what?
953180	958180	Here, Allah is helping you clean this problem. Right? يطلع عليهما ياته.
958180	962180	So the خطب is, you say, how do you give a خطب that's relevant?
962180	969180	When you give a خطب that's relevant, Allah's Book is a set of solutions, is a set of purifying reminders.
969180	976180	But if you don't know who you're giving the reminder to, if you don't have an appreciation of who you're talking to
976180	980180	when you guys come up to me and you ask me questions, right?
980180	984180	I spend an hour trying to teach you something.
984180	988180	Then those 10-15 minutes, you're teaching me something.
988180	990180	I'm learning from you. What's going on with you?
990180	993180	What confusions do you have? What questions do you have?
993180	995180	What plagues you? What's hurting?
995180	998180	And many of the things you ask me, I don't have an answer.
998180	1000180	I just don't have an answer.
1000180	1004180	But at least I know the questions, though, that I must seek out the answers in the last book.
1004180	1007180	It's like you're giving me homework assignments.
1007180	1008180	You understand?
1008180	1014180	So the job of the ممبر, the خطب is actually supposed to be that
1014180	1019180	so people can see how the Qur'an cleanses what is going on in society.
1019180	1021180	It cleanses what's happening in the lives of people.
1021180	1025180	So وَذَا نُنْ بَيْدَالِكُمْ خَيْرُوا الَّكُمْ يِنْ كُنْ تُنْ تَعْنَمُونَ
1025180	1031180	Now, a couple of places in the Qur'an that I really want you to see in connection with this idea of leaving the sail.
1031180	1036180	One is, of course, when you're leaving the sail, you're leaving profit, right?
1036180	1040180	But Allah says in another place in the Qur'an, سُتُرْبَقْرَ, He says
1040180	1043180	وَمِنَا نَاسِمَنْ يَشْرِينَ فِسَهُبْ تِرَاءَ اَمَرْضَاتِ الدَّا
1043180	1048180	Among people, there's someone who sells himself to please Allah.
1048180	1055180	You left the sail, but actually you're selling yourself to Allah.
1055180	1057180	Allah is the purchaser now.
1057180	1059180	Allah becomes the customer.
1059180	1061180	You become the product that's being sold.
1061180	1064180	إن الله هشترامي دا مُلِدِدَا وَنْ فُسَهُمْ وَأَنْ وَادَهُمْ
1064180	1066180	بِيَنَّذَهُمْ وَجَنَّةً.
1066180	1070180	Allah has purchased from believers their money and their wealth, their lives in exchange for Jannah.
1070180	1075180	Then, of course, we have Friday, but the Israelites before us, which day did they have?
1075180	1077180	They have Saturday.
1077180	1082180	And we shouldn't mess up Friday the way they messed up with Saturday.
1082180	1085180	So maybe we should know how did they mess up with Saturday?
1085180	1089180	Because that will help us learn how to not mess up Friday.
1089180	1094180	So إن سُلْتُ العَرَفِ إِذْقَالَةُمَّةُمَّةُمْ مِنْهُمْ لِمَ تَعِظُونَ قَوْمَنْ
1094180	1096180	اللَّهُمُ مُغْلِكُهُمْ.
1096180	1099180	This is the day of the Sabbath, the day of Saturday.
1099180	1102180	They were supposed to not fish.
1102180	1104180	And they used to be حاضرة البحر.
1104180	1107180	The Qur'an says they were right on the edge of us.
1107180	1108180	There was a sea town.
1108180	1111180	It was a beach town, or it was a port town.
1111180	1114180	So their income, primary income was fishing.
1114180	1118180	So they would fish every day of the week, and there would be no fish.
1118180	1123180	And then the day of Saturday, the fish would come near the shore,
1123180	1126180	and they would do flipping summer salts.
1126180	1130180	And jump up in the air and go back down.
1130180	1133180	They would come and jump up and down in front of them.
1133180	1137180	And they were like, the one day it's حرام, it jumps up and down.
1137180	1140180	And every other day, they're gone.
1140180	1142180	You can't find them, right?
1142180	1145180	So what they decided to do, according to some of us,
1145180	1147180	because the Qur'an doesn't spell it out,
1147180	1153180	but the idea, what they decided to do was leave a net on Friday night
1153180	1156180	and pick it up on Sunday morning.
1156180	1160180	And then when the fish come, they get caught in it.
1160180	1165180	Or they go whole, and when the waves come and the fish reach the shore,
1165180	1168180	when they're about to go back, they fall into the hole.
1168180	1171180	So they're like, I mean, we did do the work, technically.
1171180	1173180	We weren't thinking about that.
1173180	1175180	And what are we learning?
1175180	1178180	They tried to find technical loopholes.
1178180	1180180	Now, if you want to save money on taxes,
1180180	1183180	people look for technical loopholes, right?
1183180	1186180	Lawyers find technical loopholes.
1186180	1188180	Because that's what the law says.
1188180	1190180	I didn't technically do anything wrong.
1190180	1192180	But Allah, as I would have said,
1192180	1195180	then says, when you play games like that with the less law,
1195180	1198180	because there's the letter of the law, there's also what?
1198180	1201180	So even if they weren't violating the letter,
1201180	1204180	they were definitely violating the spirit.
1204180	1206180	Because even as you hear this, you're like,
1206180	1208180	well, technically, they didn't do anything wrong.
1208180	1213180	No, not technically, but spiritually they did, didn't they?
1213180	1215180	And so Allah said, there were people among them who said,
1215180	1216180	don't do this.
1216180	1218180	Don't violate the Sabbath.
1218180	1219180	It's a sacred day.
1219180	1221180	Allah has told us not to do this.
1221180	1222180	And they said,
1222180	1224180	اف قالة أمتو منه ولم تعدون قومن الله
1224180	1226180	ومودي كومن أو معذبهم عذاب وشديده.
1226180	1228180	So they were divided into three groups.
1228180	1231180	One group that was violating the Saturday.
1231180	1234180	One group that was trying to say, come on, don't do this.
1234180	1236180	And a third group that says,
1236180	1239180	Hey, why are you giving them advice?
1239180	1241180	Allah is going to destroy these people.
1241180	1242180	Look at them.
1242180	1243180	They don't even obey the word of Allah.
1243180	1245180	Allah will annihilate them.
1245180	1249180	And you know, Allah will destroy them, kill them.
1249180	1251180	أول عذبهم عذاب وشديده.
1251180	1253180	Or are you going to punish them in some terrible way?
1253180	1256180	You should get away from these sinful Muslims.
1256180	1258180	They're lost.
1258180	1260180	They're lost cause.
1260180	1262180	قالوا الله عزيلا تاني الرب إلى ربكم.
1262180	1264180	ولعندهم يتطلون.
1264180	1266180	They said there's two reasons we can try to advise them.
1266180	1271180	One, at least we will have an excuse before your rub.
1271180	1274180	Meaning Muslims should not abandon other Muslims.
1274180	1276180	We should still try to lovingly counter each other.
1276180	1277180	Lovingly.
1277180	1280180	لما تعدون قومن.
1280180	1282180	This ayah has so many lessons, man.
1282180	1285180	So here you have people that are openly doing Haram.
1285180	1287180	And another group is trying to advise them.
1287180	1289180	And the word used as well.
1289180	1290180	وعذبهم يتطلون.
1290180	1291180	وعذبهم يتطلون.
1291180	1292180	وعذبهم يتطلون.
1292180	1293180	وعذبهم يتطلون.
1293180	1294180	وعذبهم يتطلون.
1294180	1297180	So apparently they're not making tweets about these Muslims.
1297180	1300180	Apparently they're not making YouTube videos refuting these Muslims.
1300180	1303180	That are violating the Sabbaths.
1303180	1305180	Apparently they're not declaring them kuffar.
1305180	1309180	They're gently lovingly advising them.
1309180	1311180	Because when you attack them.
1311180	1312180	And when you critique them.
1312180	1314180	And when you say Allah will destroy them.
1314180	1316180	And when you say Allah will destroy you.
1316180	1317180	You kuffar.
1317180	1318180	You heedens.
1318180	1319180	You this and you that.
1319180	1322180	That you are only building more hatred in their hearts towards you.
1322180	1324180	And your hearts towards them.
1324180	1326180	And الله فا بين أقولوبكم.
1326180	1327180	الله قد love between your hearts.
1327180	1330180	Goes away.
1330180	1334180	Those people that are even the people that are doing the worst Haram things.
1334180	1335180	Somewhere in there they say.
1335180	1336180	They say.
1336180	1337180	They say.
1337180	1340180	Somewhere there's some glimmer of light that you might be able to reach.
1340180	1342180	If Allah told Musa to talk to Pharaoh.
1342180	1343180	And nicely.
1343180	1345180	قول الله قول الني.
1345180	1346180	And Allah says.
1346180	1347180	أذلت دعال المبينين.
1347180	1349180	We have to be humble before other believers.
1349180	1351180	And here in this I.L.
1351180	1352180	One group said.
1352180	1353180	Don't worry about these people.
1353180	1354180	Allah is going to destroy them.
1354180	1356180	These were the people on Twitter.
1356180	1357180	Right.
1357180	1359180	And the other group said.
1359180	1360180	No.
1360180	1361180	No.
1361180	1362180	We should talk to them in a dignified way.
1362180	1363180	Maybe they'll come back.
1363180	1364180	They'll come back.
1364180	1365180	They'll come back.
1365180	1367180	Why are you saying you're hopeless?
1367180	1370180	فا لما رسول الله فا يبكيروا به.
1370180	1372180	And when they forgot what they were reminded of.
1372180	1373180	الله says.
1373180	1376180	نجينا النذينة ينهون عن السور.
1376180	1380180	We rescued those who used to stop from doing wrong.
1380180	1383180	الله only rescued one group.
1383180	1384180	The group that was concerned.
1384180	1385180	They got rescued.
1385180	1386180	Then he says.
1386180	1389180	و أخذنا النذينة اللهم و بعذابين بئيس.
1389180	1390180	And those who did wrong.
1390180	1392180	We grabbed them with a terrible punishment.
1392180	1394180	Now the question became.
1394180	1396180	Who was the one who did wrong?
1396180	1397180	There were two opinions among the Sahaba.
1397180	1399180	Because Allah didn't say openly who did wrong.
1399180	1401180	There could be two wrong parties here.
1401180	1405180	The people who were fishing on Saturday.
1405180	1408180	And the people who didn't care about them.
1408180	1411180	Because apparently that's also wrong.
1411180	1414180	So some Sahaba said it doesn't include both.
1414180	1416180	Some Sahaba said it doesn't include both.
1416180	1418180	I'm more inclined to believe it includes both.
1418180	1420180	Because Allah mentioned three groups.
1420180	1422180	But then reduced them to two.
1422180	1424180	So it's not like he's silent on the third one.
1424180	1425180	Like you figure it out.
1425180	1426180	But actually it seems like.
1426180	1427180	And previously they said.
1427180	1428180	و أعزيراتهم يداربكم.
1428180	1430180	At least we will have an excuse.
1430180	1432180	Which is to say they won't have an excuse.
1432180	1433180	You know.
1433180	1435180	So this is the.
1435180	1436180	The.
1436180	1437180	The.
1437180	1438180	The.
1438180	1439180	The.
1439180	1440180	The.
1440180	1441180	The.
1441180	1442180	The.
1442180	1443180	The.
1443180	1444180	The.
1444180	1445180	The.
1445180	1446180	The.
1446180	1447180	The.
1447180	1448180	The.
1448180	1449180	The.
1449180	1450180	The.
1450180	1451180	The.

1462180	1463180	The.
1463180	1464180	The.
1466180	1467180	The.
1467180	1468180	The.
1468180	1469180	The.
1469180	1470180	The.
1470180	1471180	The.
1471180	1472180	The.
1472180	1473180	The.

1481180	1482180	The.

1662940	1668940	فلنحن نحن نحن نحن بحاجة لتحديث سلطة طلاق one day that's gonna get me in trouble anyway
1668940	1674940	so so now from عام تخاص this is an interesting point i mean actually this
1674940	1682060	what he makes it is um it is to see it i'll simplify this for you um you know if if someone in this
1682780	1689500	group said something bad or did something mean i have two choices i could say
1690460	1695500	this one yeah and then i could point it yeah but i could just
1696140	1701900	expose him and what he did and what he said and all of it or i could say it would be nicer
1702460	1707980	it would be kind if all of us could be a little more patient with each other and we could just
1707980	1713020	you know sit respectfully and etc and not speak during the general i etc in other words i didn't
1713020	1719020	point it out directly i kept it general so the person who was being talked to can take the hint
1719500	1724300	other people can benefit too but nobody got embarrassed do you understand when unless
1724300	1730140	i i'll you there were some people this is this i these iot came in the incident of an event where
1730140	1734540	people actually didn't show up to جما the way they were supposed to and some people walked away
1734540	1740300	from جما that's the context and in that context i could have pointed out those people and said you
1740300	1743500	shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have done this and you shouldn't have done this but
1743500	1749340	الله has just opened it up in general those of you who have faith or claim to have faith when the call is made
1749980	1754700	rush to the remembrance of الله leave the sail that's better for you it's positive reinforcement isn't it
1755660	1760300	and then he says and when the prayer is done فا يدى قدية تسعنة let's talk about قباء
1761420	1769340	there's two words in Arabic that are really cool قباء and أداق قباء and أداق so قدائ تنفر
1770060	1775980	قدائ تنفر which actually means the same thing i fulfilled my duty i fulfilled my duty but what happened
1775980	1781980	in islamic culture and literature is we say if you prayed your prayer on time at daytaha
1783420	1788060	and if you prayed it later that it becomes a قباء but actually originally they mean the same
1788060	1793260	thing that and قباء actually technically need the same thing okay now what does this word actually
1793260	1798940	mean it means to give a decision someone called means a deadly poison to finish something to
1798940	1804300	end something to be done with something like if you finish a product or project then you did
1804300	1809900	قداء of the project you completed it and you no longer owe any obligations or sometimes your boss
1809900	1815580	says if you finish this task then you can leave before five o'clock right or your parents
1815580	1819820	you're to a child they say finish your homework as soon as you finish then you can play video games
1820380	1826540	but not before so the moment they're done he's like قدائ تقديق
1827020	1835020	okay it's done i don't owe this anymore i finished this obligation which means i am set free okay
1835020	1840060	the idea of قداء also it is used in the payment of debts when you pay a debt you're free
1841180	1847340	so now Allah is using the term قدية تصلا when the when the prayer has been given its due
1848220	1854460	when the payment has been made meaning you owe Allah this prayer you owe Allah this prayer
1854540	1862460	و when that payment is made فن تشيروف الارضي i love this iya spread out in the land go everywhere
1863260	1867580	the Israelites were told to remain confined in home they couldn't spread out
1868140	1873740	Allah tells us finish the Friday prayer and spread out go everywhere spread out everywhere
1873740	1877660	what does that mean spread out everywhere you just got inspired by the word of Allah
1878540	1884220	then you went to the university then some of you went back to the office some of you went to the store
1884300	1888620	some of you went and continued to drive your hooldware some of you whatever you do
1888620	1892380	you went back to the restaurant to work you went to hang out with your friends some of you went back home
1893660	1895500	wherever you went back what did you take with you
1897500	1899580	you took a little bit of light with you
1900380	1905500	Allah wants that light to spread everywhere Allah wants the impact of what happened inside the
1905500	1911740	مشد to affect society outside the مشد so he says is it beauty the wildest iron is hot
1911820	1917260	when the heat is intense when the light is hot it is intense go spread it everywhere
1917260	1921740	spread out everywhere and you will you will bring this light to your office
1922540	1926220	to your you know it's not like you're going to go and say okay okay i'm at the office

1941180	1945980	has integrity and you stand up by what's right because you carried some light back with you
1946540	1950780	you're about to cheat on your exam with some friends and you say no no no Allah is watching
1950780	1954540	i just heard a خبا about the تفوى of الله i'm not going to violate the تفوى 20 minutes later

1968220	1971900	are the خبا about your family the خبا about the rights of the family
1975740	1980540	if you can pardon overlook you know sometimes you have an argument with your family one argument
1980540	1983820	that happened six months ago but you bring it up over and over again and beat it over the head
1984940	1991660	or Allah says if you can forgive and overlook and move on that Allah is forgiving and you go home and
1991740	1998780	you see the person's face and you're like i so want to do this right now the food won't taste
1998780	2003900	as spicy if i don't do this this is some people need ketchup with their food other people need
2003900	2008860	comments with their food how am i going to make this food taste good without the comments and you just
2008860	2016140	heard the خبا and you're like food tastes good feels good you you took it with you
2017100	2023580	فانتشيرو فلنو go spread out and that he says what tell women from the night even more beautiful words
2023580	2030220	he says pursue out of Allah's favor Allah's favor here actually means that his
2031100	2038300	go make money go make money go seek opportunity go travel to a new place
2039020	2043260	go learn this is all the father of Allah how do we know this is the father of Allah
2043340	2047260	الله uses this word father in the concept of the context of the
2047260	2051260	he says there's no harm if you pursue
2051260	2055660	فضل from your when you're at the meaning people come to the from all over the world right
2056380	2059900	so they would bring this one would bring their clothes from this place and this one
2059900	2063260	the blankets and this one will bring rugs and they're selling it to each other in
2063260	2068300	import export business isn't it and they're making some money when they're at that's called from
2069100	2076140	الله now says hey you left the bay here you left the sale and you came to me now go and I will
2076140	2081820	give you extra what's the word for extra فضل I will give you more than what you expected
2081820	2086860	go look for that though it won't come to you you have to go after it you can't say when is the
2086860	2094780	father level coming will be the oh pursue pursue out of the father level love pursue every opportunity
2094780	2099980	you can and the min also means you might see a glimpse of the father and you capture it
2099980	2104940	you see a small opportunity and you'll take full advantage you know in sports for example in
2104940	2109900	strategic sports you're when you're when you're you know facing an opponent when you're when the
2109900	2114700	offense you look for a small opening when you look for that small opening that becomes your
2114700	2119900	strategic you know avenue to score the goal or to hit the knockout punch or whatever right
2120620	2125500	that that's small opportunity you see it as a big opportunity and this mentality
2125500	2130700	وفتاقو من فضل دا means oh no no the door's not wide open so there's nothing happening
2130700	2135500	hold on the door is this much open it's half an inch open you should you should see that as
2136060	2141500	ابترا من فضل دا it's not even the full father level lights من فضل دا it's from the open
2141500	2147340	the opportunity given by Allah from the favor given to from Allah that's there and now you must pursue
2147660	2152300	that gap wider you must you must take full advantage of that opportunity so let's
2152300	2156860	is what that will mean فضل دا isn't it beautiful that the most spiritual lesson is being
2156860	2162220	complement complemented with material gain and what was this I used for the already didn't it
2166700	2170540	will follow the Quran the revelation the cleansing that was the father level
2171180	2178700	now this is also the father level the best of the internal and the best of the external
2178700	2183900	you know there's the the the internal the the the the bottom is being cleansed by the word of
2183900	2190700	الله that's the father level and the external now you can pursue حلال you know income you can
2190700	2195420	seek the father level and by the way after coming out of the prayer you're going to live by the law of
2195420	2199820	الله which means you're going to pursue حلال right and that's really what's going to bring
2200700	2204700	and then look at that why did you go to جمع prayer what was the goal
2209820	2217020	remembering الله the goal was جمع is done go go back to work go back to university go back home
2217020	2222380	go back to whatever work you were doing and الله says what good Allah if you remember Allah a lot
