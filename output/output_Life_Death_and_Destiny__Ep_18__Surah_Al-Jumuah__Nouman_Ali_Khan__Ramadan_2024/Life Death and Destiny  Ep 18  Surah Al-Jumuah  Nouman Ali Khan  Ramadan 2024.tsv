0	3760	So the donkey that was trying to get rid of its burden ended up
3760	7520	carrying even more, which is an interesting analogy because the Israelites,
7520	11040	they tried to play with the word of Allah and the more they tried to play with it,
11040	14320	life became more and more difficult for them.
14320	16720	Three more complications came in their life.
16720	20480	Obeying the word of Allah makes life easy.
20480	24240	Disobeying the word of Allah makes life difficult. That is the Quran's formula.
24240	27840	It's always been there since the beginning.
30880	34240	Salamu alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that
34800	37520	so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayna TV.
37520	41840	I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end
41840	43840	in brief and then in great detail.
43840	46960	And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanatv.com.
46960	49440	And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV,
49440	53200	I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family
53200	54800	and give it as a gift also. Thank you.
60000	62000	Salamu alaikum.
84800	86800	Once again everybody, salamu alaikum.
86800	89200	We're going to take a little bit of
89840	92480	closer look at some excerpts from Jewish literature,
92480	93920	from Jewish scholarly literature.
94720	98080	This is something called the Sefri Debarim.
98080	101680	It's a Midrash compilation. Midrash is one of their earliest scholarly works,
101680	105120	kind of the Tafseer work from the third and the fifth century.
105120	107600	And it's called an analogy of the Jews and the Gentiles,
107600	110080	basically the believers and the Umayyim.
110080	112480	So Gentiles, the Goyim, are the Umayyim to them.
112480	117280	Okay. And here's the analogy. Listen to this carefully. I'll explain as we go.
117360	120960	A man sent his donkey and his dog to the granary,
120960	126000	where 15 saha of grain, basically 15 bags of grain,
126560	130160	were loaded atop the donkey and three on the dog.
131280	133600	So 15 on the donkey, three on the dog.
133600	138080	The donkey walked and the dog strained to breathe his tongue lolling.
138640	142240	He cast aside one saha and placed it atop the donkey.
142240	146080	Then he then sent the same with the second and then the third.
146080	148880	This is how Israel accepted the Torah,
148880	152080	together with its commentaries and its minutiae.
152080	155200	Even those seven commandments that the Noah hides,
155200	158480	meaning the survivors from the time of Nukh Ali Salaam,
158480	162720	could not abide and cast aside. Israel came and accepted.
162720	165840	Okay. So the idea in this literature is that they,
166480	170480	humanity, the rest of humanity could not carry the burden of revelation
170480	173520	and they decided to be the ones to carry it.
173520	176320	So who gets credit? The Israelites get credit.
176320	179040	If you look at this ayah, Allah responds to this by saying,
179040	181840	Homilu, they were given the burden.
181840	184480	They didn't take it, they were given the burden,
184480	187120	so that credit is not given to them using the passive form.
188160	189920	On top of that, they didn't carry.
189920	192400	Now two animals were mentioned in this analogy.
192400	193280	What are the two animals?
194320	195120	Donkey and the dog.
195120	196880	And the donkey was able to carry the burden
196880	199840	and the dog was not able to carry the burden.
199840	201520	It's interesting that in the Quran,
201520	203920	both the analogy of the donkey and the dog is used.
204720	207200	Responding to this, in this surah, it's the donkey
207200	209440	and in Surat al-A'raf, it's going to be the dog.
209440	211280	And literally the donkey burden too.
211280	214400	In tahmed alayhi al-yalhaf wa'intatruku yalhaf,
214400	217600	if you put a burden on the dog, it will start drooling
217600	220560	and if you don't put it, it will still start drooling
220560	222400	because they are people of dunya.
222960	223520	Right?
223520	225360	But we'll get into the dog analogy one day
225360	226960	when we study Surat al-A'raf,
226960	229600	but right now I want to tell you about the donkey analogy.
229600	232400	The idea is the donkey was able to carry the burden
232400	233920	and therefore became the hero.
234560	236640	And thus is the burden of the Israelites.
236640	238720	You see how Allah is using something they used
238720	241520	in a positive sense and re-engineering it and saying,
241520	244560	yes, you did carry it like the donkey quite literally.
245840	248560	So you didn't use just a donkey carrying books.
248560	249280	Is what happened.
249840	250560	Okay?
250560	252400	So that's another.
252400	255040	Now interesting that in the Hebrew language,
255040	258000	in the rabbinic text, the word for the donkey is hamur,
258880	261360	which is basically the Arabic equivalent for what?
261920	262880	Al-Himar.
262880	263600	Okay?
263600	265440	And yahlmulu asfara,
266080	269840	asfara is the word, usually in Arabic we say kutuban.
269840	271520	We don't say asfaran,
271520	275840	but the rabbis themselves use sefer for scriptures
275840	278400	and the plural is used in Arabic here asfar.
278400	280480	So Allah is actually using words in Arabic
280480	282640	that are closest to the rabbinic text.
282640	284880	So they feel a connection to what they have
285440	287200	when Allah is speaking too.
287200	289920	So we learn something from it and secondarily,
289920	291280	they're hearing something.
291280	293600	Then another dimension of the donkey study.
294160	298560	The Zohar, another Talbudic text, Hebrew text,
298560	300720	teaches that the donkey is avi awot,
300720	304240	haatuma, I've probably butchered that pronunciation.
304240	306560	The ultimate source of impurity.
306560	307920	What I read today was fascinating.
307920	309520	They consider the pig impure,
310160	312320	they consider the camel impure,
312320	314080	and they consider the donkey impure,
314080	315120	but between the three of them,
315120	316720	the donkey is the most impure to them.
317760	319040	So in their literature,
319040	321040	the donkey is the most impure of all the three.
321600	324480	In addition, the Hebrew word for donkey,
324480	328000	chamoor, shares the same root as the word for material.
328960	331760	And that's why the donkey is a symbol of materialism
331760	333360	and crassness in Jewish literature.
333360	335280	Okay, now a few interesting things here.
335280	337600	One, the donkey is the most impure.
338400	339280	Look at this passage.
339280	342080	What did Allah do with human beings that accept this message?
342640	343600	What is that key him?
344560	346320	Look at what they believed about themselves.
347280	350000	They believed about themselves that because they were under the mountain,
350000	351840	they were pure.
351840	354320	And now Allah is using the analogy of the animal
354320	358000	they consider the most impure and saying this is,
358000	360560	so he's reversing a lot of the themes
360560	362240	that they carried for themselves.
362240	365040	Also, you will see later on in this passage
365040	367600	that they, and one of the things we saw about them
367600	369520	was they love life, right?
369520	370560	They don't want to face death.
371200	373120	And they will never wish for death.
374000	379680	And that materialism is something that we should be afraid of in ourselves.
380240	383120	And what is the donkey a symbol of in their literature?
383120	384800	The symbol of materialism,
385600	387600	of just having more and more in this life
387600	389440	and not concerning yourself with the next.
390640	392240	Then there was something really interesting.
392240	397120	I was just trying to find how is their religious tradition looking at donkeys?
397920	400880	Where's the imagery of the donkey, the symbolism of the donkey?
400880	401920	We have it in the Quran.
401920	403280	We have this example.
403280	404080	We have
404080	411120	So we have references to the donkey in multiple places in the Quran too,
411120	412240	in different ways.
412240	415040	But the Israelites in Egypt had sunk to the lowest levels of
415040	416160	This is not from my literature.
416160	416720	This is theirs.
416720	418560	This is from an article I got from a Jewish website,
419920	421280	Torah study website.
421280	424960	The Israelites in Egypt had sunk to the lowest levels of idolatry and impurity.
424960	428240	Outwardly, they were indistinguishable from the Egyptian neighbors.
428240	429440	When they lived in Egypt,
429440	431200	the Egyptians had their Shirk-i religion.
432000	434800	And this is saying that the Banu Isra'in,
434800	436320	when they were living in Egypt,
436320	438160	they basically were following the same religion.
438880	442160	They looked like they were doing exactly the same Shirk as the Egyptians were doing.
442160	443280	According to the Midrash,
443280	447120	even the angels were unable to distinguish between the two nations.
447120	449920	They questioned God's decision to rescue the Israelites
449920	450800	at the Red Sea,
450800	454160	protesting both the Egyptians and the Israelites worship idols.
454720	456160	But as with the donkey,
456160	459120	the impurity of the Jewish people was only on the surface.
459520	461360	Hiding a great inner holiness.
462560	463920	Maybe you're pure on the outside,
463920	466480	but there's an inner holiness on the inside.
466480	467920	This is actually pretty interesting.
468480	470960	They believe that doesn't matter how impure the donkey is,
470960	471920	he's pure on the inside.
471920	472960	Why is he pure on the inside?
472960	474320	Where did the purity come from?
474320	476080	Well, when they escaped Egypt,
476080	477680	they escaped a lot on donkeys.
478640	480960	Donkeys carried their gold, their items,
480960	482640	and carried all their burdens.
482640	483760	So they escaped.
483760	486800	So the donkey became a symbol of their rescue from Egypt,
486800	488640	even though the donkey is impure.
488640	490720	So then they developed this entire philosophy
490720	492320	that even though we are impure,
492320	493840	God will still save us.
493840	495360	Like the donkey is impure,
495360	497600	and he still was a means to be saved.
498160	498720	Right?
498720	499840	Now what are the Quran say,
499840	501040	qunubuna ulf?
501040	503040	Our hearts are saved.
503840	504960	Deep inside, remember?
506160	508720	It's quite literally that commentary.
508720	511360	Now they believe there's a Messiah coming.
512080	513600	So they believe in their literature.
513600	515760	And we already know that Allah told us
515760	517600	that they were told from the very beginning
517600	519040	that the Prophet will come.
519680	520720	It's in Surat Al-A'raf.
520720	520880	Right?
520880	522160	So they have some version of that.
522160	524000	They call that the Messiah is coming.
524000	524560	Okay?
524560	527040	Now, let the Messiah come.
527040	530400	And may I merit to sit in the shadow of his donkey's dung.
532080	532880	The Rabbi says,
532880	536320	if only I could just be when the Rasul comes,
536960	539600	and I could be around even his donkey and his donkey's poo,
540160	542080	that'd be in the shadow of his donkey's dung.
542080	543280	That'd be good for me.
543280	544880	Once again, we find the metaphor
544880	546480	of the donkey used in connection
546480	547760	with the messianic era.
547760	548000	Okay.
548560	548960	This is...
548960	549200	I'm gonna...
549200	551280	Let me explain this to you before I read for a game.
551280	554400	So what happens is they believe that a Messiah will come.
555120	557280	But either the Messiah will come from the sky
558480	560640	or he will come riding on a donkey.
561760	562640	Two ways.
562640	565440	If the Israelites are good and they're pure
565440	568960	and they don't do any sins and they become clean,
568960	571600	then the Messiah will come from the sky like a miracle.
572720	574960	But if the Israelites have become sinful
574960	578240	and they're dirty and they've made a lot of mistakes,
578240	579120	they will still be saved
579120	580720	because the Messiah will come and save them.
580720	583200	But this time he will come on a donkey,
583200	584720	but they'll still be purified.
584720	585680	They'll still be...
585680	587760	And by the way, the word is really interesting.
587760	589360	Now that you understand that,
590000	592880	the Rabbi here is saying that I'm pretty sure
592880	595680	he's gonna come on a donkey because we're pretty messed up.
596320	598000	That's what he's basically saying.
598000	598320	Okay.
599200	603040	Especially the part that even Israel does not deserve it.
603040	604720	Meaning if they don't deserve a Messiah,
604720	605920	then he will come on a donkey.
608640	610880	They will get the Messiah to redeem them.
610880	613520	It's just that the Messiah in that case
613520	614800	will come riding on a donkey.
614800	616400	Looking at the Hebrew in the Talmud,
616400	619520	the word for deserving is actually the word
619520	622080	a zekah, purification in Arabic.
629440	633600	Allah is purifying their concept of purification.
634800	636480	Because their concept was no matter what,
636480	638080	in the end we will be saved.
638080	640720	No matter what, even if we're not deserving,
642160	643920	the Messiah will come and rescue us.
643920	646480	So the word Safar, which is used in the ayah,
649520	650960	is actually in the Arabic language,
650960	651520	Safar...
651520	653840	I think everybody knows Safar, Musafiq, travel, right?
654720	658480	And Ms. Safar is a blade to remove something.
658480	660880	And Fara Safar is a slender horse.
660880	662960	Basically the idea of Safar is movement.
663920	665200	The idea of Safar is movement.
665200	668240	And the Asfah are volumes and rolls and rolls and rolls
668240	669760	of their books, their literature.
670320	672560	They didn't have books like this, like open like this.
672560	674800	They're rolls on both ends.
674800	676640	So there's two sides that roll together,
676640	678560	and then you open them up, right?
678560	679120	So there's like...
680560	682400	It's a long, long, long scroll,
682400	684560	and they write each one of them one at a time,
684560	686720	and they roll them together to get to a certain page.
687360	689760	They roll both sides of it to get to a certain page, okay?
689760	691680	This is actually referred to in Surat al-Tur.
692320	692960	One of those is...
696960	697200	Right?
697200	699440	That's actually referring to the Torah.
702000	702640	Okay?
702640	704240	So that's the word used.
704240	708240	It's very logical because in that kind of a design,
708240	710480	you have to literally travel with the material.
711440	714080	You have to actually navigate the text
714880	717280	and roll the pages as you go, okay?
718080	718240	So...
721040	721360	Okay.
721760	724640	Now, the imagery of sharing books.
724640	725520	Let's talk about that.
725520	725760	Let's...
726640	727440	There's something called...
728240	731120	Ataswi'l al-Fani, like the Quran paints a picture.
731120	733200	So now the picture in my mind is there's a donkey,
733200	736720	and there's a bunch of loaded sacks of scrolls,
736720	740240	sacred scrolls of the Israelite rabbis that are on it.
740240	742640	Why would the scrolls be on here?
742640	746560	Well, the Israelites, they moved a lot, right?
746560	748160	They were attacked and they had to move,
748720	750640	and they were attacked and they had to move again,
750640	753680	and one of the most precious, valuable things they had is their Torah,
754320	756720	which is on these large, large scrolls.
756720	759360	So they had to move them on the back of a donkey.
759360	761200	So go from one place to another to another.
761760	764640	Also, when one rabbi dies,
764640	767680	or when one rabbi passes responsibility to another rabbi,
767680	769840	they have to deliver the Torah.
769840	770880	How are they going to deliver it?
770880	771600	It's too large.
771600	774960	They're going to put it on a donkey, right?
774960	777600	So now the image of the delivery system,
777600	780000	their way of delivering a package,
780000	782640	the Torah package is actually by way of donkeys.
783760	785680	But why is that analogy being used?
785680	789760	It is as if to say it's just the donkey carrying the load from one place to another,
789760	791280	then from another place to another,
791280	792640	then from another place to another,
793280	796400	and it's just a transfer of these scrolls,
796400	798240	but nobody's actually reading these scrolls.
798240	799520	It's just an empty delivery.
800480	801520	It's just passing down.
802080	804640	So the book no longer has meaning,
804640	806560	it's just something that gets passed down.
807200	809360	One thing that really scared me about this analogy
809920	811920	is that in the country I come from,
811920	814400	and I don't know if many of you come from different countries,
814400	815360	but in Muslim countries,
815360	817760	we have this tradition that we want to make sure,
817760	820800	it doesn't matter if our child knows Arabic or not,
820800	822400	learns their Dean or not, whatever,
822400	824400	we have to get someone to come to the house
824400	827120	and make sure they read the Quran from the Fatihah to the Nast.
827120	828640	They did the khatamah of the Quran,
828640	829680	now they're done with the Quran,
829680	830800	they can move on with their life.
831840	833600	And that child, when they grew up,
833600	835920	they're like, my parents made me finish the Quran,
835920	837600	I need to make sure my child also
838320	839120	finishes the Quran.
839120	841520	They call the, did you finish Quran?
841520	843760	I love that phrase, it's a very deadly phrase.
843760	844960	Did you finish the Quran?
844960	846160	You're finished, bro.
846800	847920	The Quran's not finished.
848880	850640	You can't finish the Quran.
850640	852320	Stop mortal combat.
852320	852640	Okay?
854960	856720	But you're basically, you're done with it,
856720	858160	you don't need that anymore.
858160	860640	And it's just an empty exercise,
860640	864320	a ritual passed down from one generation to another to another,
864320	866000	where the father or the mother,
866000	868560	no less, no nothing of the Quran,
868560	869840	neither does the child,
869840	871120	but it's just being delivered,
871120	873760	like just a mindless passing down.
877760	880880	There's an interesting parallel in his story
880880	882800	that is also about the Israelites,
882800	885520	about how their leaders,
885520	887200	when they escaped Egypt,
888080	889840	they had lots of donkeys and, you know,
889840	890880	different people had animals,
890880	892240	but a lot of people had jewelry.
892240	893040	And they didn't want,
893040	894160	when they're walking in the desert,
894160	896480	they accidentally, their jewelry falls out of their pocket,
896480	898240	and now it's lost in the desert.
898240	900400	So they all collected all of their jewelry,
900400	902000	and they gave it to some of their leaders
902880	904160	to carry on their donkeys,
904160	906480	and to carry with them, right?
906480	909920	So the leaders were carrying everybody's valuable assets.
910560	910880	Okay?
911520	912960	And what happened is,
913680	915440	the leaders were really scared
915440	917600	that they were carrying everybody's valuable assets,
917600	919440	because if somebody comes and attacks,
919440	921360	they're not going to attack the empty donkeys.
922080	922640	They're going to,
922640	924160	the leaders are going to get killed first,
925200	927840	because the privilege of carrying everybody's money
927840	929600	also came with a lot of responsibility.
930400	931200	So what happened then,
931200	933840	when Musa Aleyh said I'm left to speak with Allah,
933840	935600	behind him, Samiri came and said,
935600	937040	hey, Musa's gone,
937040	939760	and the only way we're going to get our prayers answered
939760	940560	is by way of,
941760	945360	he came up with this scheme of designing a cow, right?
946160	948000	Where's he going to get the materials to make the cow?
949120	950960	From the gold and whatever they had left.
951360	952640	But all of that was not with them,
952640	953600	that was with their leaders.
954640	957200	So the people rushed to the leaders and said,
957200	958000	give us all our gold,
958000	958640	give us the gold,
958640	959840	we need the gold right now.
959840	961120	Why did they need the gold?
961120	962560	Because they wanted to put it all together,
962560	964400	melt it and turn it into a calf.
964960	966400	So the leaders were like,
966400	967200	instead of stopping,
967200	968640	they were like, please take it,
968640	969840	I don't want to be the one to die.
970400	971840	Go ahead, just take it.
971840	972160	So,
975920	977360	We were carried,
977360	979600	we were made to carry the burdens
979600	980720	of the good things,
980720	981440	the beautiful things,
981440	983200	being the jewelry of the people.
983200	984560	But the moment they told us,
984560	985280	take, get rid of it,
985280	986000	we were happily,
986000	986880	we just threw it away,
986880	987760	we just got rid of it.
988720	990400	There's also an imagery of,
990400	992240	you're given a heavy responsibility,
992240	993680	but you just want to be done away with it.
993680	995760	You don't want to deal with that responsibility.
995760	996240	Right?
996240	997520	And that's also inside,
997520	999840	Yehmi al-Asfara bi-samatanu qaumin
999840	1001200	dathinakadzebu bi-ayatina.
1001200	1001600	Now,
1001600	1002960	we don't have to get into the,
1004640	1004960	actually,
1004960	1006080	now I'll just talk to you a little bit
1006080	1007360	and we'll wrap it up today, inshallah.
1007920	1008080	Now,
1009040	1012000	the analogy of donkey being carried,
1012000	1013280	to made to carry burdens,
1013280	1015200	donkeys are actually animals
1015200	1016560	that endure a lot of pain,
1017120	1018560	because human beings have used them
1018560	1020080	to go up mountains
1020080	1021040	and to put more and more
1021040	1022880	and heavier and heavier loads on them.
1022880	1025040	And donkeys do everything they can to just,
1025040	1027120	any way they can just get rid of the burden somehow.
1027760	1028640	They can just drop some,
1028640	1030080	they lean sometimes
1030080	1030640	and try to,
1031280	1032000	you know, get rid of it.
1032000	1034800	And then what their owners do is,
1034800	1035520	so that they don't,
1035520	1037600	they're not able to tip over,
1037600	1039440	they put the kind of load on them
1039440	1040720	that half of it is on one side
1040720	1042320	and half of it is on the other side.
1042320	1042960	So they're kind of,
1042960	1044160	now they double the load,
1044880	1045440	right?
1045440	1046720	And then they figure there's,
1046720	1047760	when they were carrying one,
1047760	1049840	because if you put it right on top of the body,
1049840	1051280	it's one kind of weight.
1051280	1052960	But if they try to get rid of it,
1052960	1053680	then the owner says,
1053680	1054240	okay, you know what,
1054240	1056480	I'll just split it on either side.
1056480	1057760	But then the owner realizes,
1057760	1059120	I could put a lot more on here now.
1059840	1060240	Right?
1060240	1062560	So the donkey that was trying to get rid of its burden
1062560	1065360	ended up carrying even more,
1065360	1066720	which is an interesting analogy
1066720	1067680	because the Israelites,
1067680	1069600	they tried to play with the word of Allah
1069600	1071200	and the more they tried to play with it,
1071200	1073200	life became more and more difficult for them.
1074560	1076880	Three more complications came in their life.
1076880	1079440	Obeying the word of Allah makes life easy.
1080640	1083120	Disobeying the word of Allah makes life difficult.
1083120	1084480	That is the Quran's formula.
1084480	1086000	It's always been there since the beginning.
1086560	1087360	That's why Allah says,
1087360	1088240	You read Allah will be
1088240	1089600	You kafifa al-kum.
1089600	1091280	Allah intends to make your burden
1091280	1092560	easy, lighter.
1092560	1094000	Wa quli qad ilsanu dha'ifa
1094000	1095360	Human beings were created weak.
1095360	1097840	Marriage was made easy.
1097840	1099600	Divorce was made easy.
1099600	1101360	Inheritance was made easy.
1101360	1103200	Prayer was made easy.
1103200	1104560	Zakat was made easy.
1105360	1107200	All matters in Islam are actually
1107760	1109120	things that make life easy.
1109120	1110800	And all the things you'll notice,
1110800	1113360	all the things that are prohibited in Islam,
1113360	1115920	like alcohol or gambling or any,
1115920	1117520	all of them are either addictions
1118800	1120800	or if you stay in them,
1120800	1122640	they create a lot of difficulties.
1122880	1124640	Like even if they feel good in the moment,
1124640	1126720	they will create like enormous
1126720	1128560	long-term burdens and difficulties.
1128560	1131200	So the thing, the law of Allah,
1131200	1132560	the purpose of the law of Allah
1132560	1134960	is actually to make the burden lighter.
1134960	1137520	But when they didn't follow the exact law of Allah,
1137520	1139600	the burden kept getting heavier and heavier
1139600	1140880	and heavier and heavier and heavier
1140880	1143600	on the like ad-danki that is being made
1143600	1145040	to carry so much load.
1145760	1147360	There's also a pretty storm criticism.
1147360	1149360	Ad-danki doesn't understand what it's carrying.
1149360	1151280	But the rabbis did understand
1151280	1152000	the Torah.
1152000	1152720	They didn't.
1152720	1154400	So there's a contradiction in the parallel.
1155120	1157200	The animal doesn't understand what it's carrying.
1157200	1158880	But the scholars of the Torah
1158880	1161040	understood what they were carrying.
1161680	1164320	Allah is saying that kind of understanding
1164320	1166400	is as good as not understanding at all.
1167840	1170320	Scary that you can know something,
1170320	1172320	but if you know the word of Allah,
1172320	1173920	but you're not benefiting from it,
1173920	1175360	you're not living by it,
1175360	1178240	it's Kitab and not Hikmah, right?
1178240	1180160	Then there's the word of Allah.
1180480	1182880	Then there's no difference between an animal
1182880	1184560	who doesn't know it at all.
1185840	1187680	There's, in other words, there's real,
1188480	1190320	there's the real knowing of the book
1190320	1192400	and there's the artificial knowing of the book.
1193040	1195760	And we have to be afraid that our relationship
1195760	1197600	with the Quran will no longer be real,
1197600	1200080	it will become artificial.
1200080	1201520	That's the scary part.
1201520	1202480	Which is why I want to,
1202480	1203680	before I end this session,
1203680	1205440	I want to take you back to the second ayah
1205440	1206320	for a quick moment.
1206640	1210960	We, you know, the recitation of the Quran,
1211840	1214160	the recitation of the Quran should be beautified.
1214880	1217760	And if you don't know how to recite the Quran with the Jwi,
1217760	1219360	and you don't know how to recite the Quran
1219360	1220960	melodiously, for example,
1220960	1223120	this is something you should work on for yourself.
1224000	1225760	You should, one, be listening.
1225760	1228480	If you like listening to a recitation of the Quran,
1228480	1229760	that Haqqari that you like,
1229760	1231200	somebody that you enjoy listening to,
1231920	1233920	listen to them, put them on and listen to them,
1233920	1235600	make a habit out of listening to the Quran.
1235600	1237760	While you're the study of the Quran
1237760	1238800	and the engagement with the Quran,
1238800	1240080	that all has its purpose.
1240080	1241840	But listening to the recitation of the Quran
1241840	1242560	has its own purpose.
1242560	1246080	But ultimately, even the listening should be replaced
1246080	1246560	with what?
1248000	1250400	With yourself reciting the Quran.
1250400	1251200	And you have to,
1251200	1252640	you have to try to work on that
1252640	1255520	to the point where you start enjoying reciting the Quran.
1256160	1257280	And when you do that,
1257280	1258720	that is actually when you're starting
1258720	1260880	to have a real relationship with the Quran.
1260880	1261520	People say,
1261520	1263440	I want a relationship with the Quran.
1263440	1264560	The relationship with the Quran
1264560	1266000	is not just going to come from study.
1266640	1268480	That's going to be an intellectual relationship.
1269120	1271680	But a real relationship with the Quran,
1271680	1273760	the emotional bond with the Quran,
1273760	1275680	your heart is attached to the Quran,
1275680	1276960	that's going to come from recitation.
1276960	1278560	That's not going to come from the Seer study.
1279360	1281360	That's not going to come from listening to lectures.
1281360	1283600	That's another department,
1284240	1286480	two different departments, you know?
1286480	1288560	And that deserves its own attention.
1290560	1291280	I can tell you,
1292720	1293920	the study of the Quran,
1294800	1296320	when these weeks,
1296320	1297840	when I'm teaching Quran week,
1297840	1299600	I'm all up in Quran study.
1300160	1300720	Right?
1300720	1302480	At the moment this week is done,
1302480	1303840	I'm not studying any Quran.
1304720	1305680	I'm just reciting.
1306640	1308080	I'm just reciting.
1308880	1311520	Because what I see in myself is,
1312320	1314160	if you focus too much on the mind,
1314960	1318160	then the heart starts to suffer.
1318160	1321040	And then you have to replenish that with the heart.
1321040	1321520	And you have to,
1321520	1323680	the recitation actually helps the heart.
1323680	1325040	It helps, it calms me,
1325040	1326640	it gives me peace.
1327280	1328080	You know?
1328080	1329600	It makes me feel connected to Allah,
1329600	1332560	so Allah makes me feel connected to the Quran.
1332560	1334240	And then when I recite it,
1334240	1335600	then it makes me more curious,
1335600	1336800	and it brings me back to what?
1337760	1338640	The study.
1338640	1342160	And then the study makes me want to go back to recite.
1342160	1343040	And there's this kind of,
1343600	1344480	there's the
1344480	1347120	يطلوع عليهم آياته ويزكيهم
1347120	1348080	on the one side,
1348080	1350640	and then يعدهم الكتابة والحكمة
1350640	1351360	on the other side.
1351360	1352960	And that should be every person's life,
1352960	1354800	like a little bit of time,
1354800	1355680	and the recitation,
1355680	1356960	a little bit of time in the study,
1356960	1357680	and you're kind of,
1357680	1358880	you're building your relationship
1358880	1360560	on both fronts with Allah's Book.
1361120	1363600	And don't underestimate the value of one or the other.
1364160	1365680	Like people say,
1365680	1366960	people get on extremes and say,
1366960	1368800	oh, you don't even understand what you're reciting.
1368800	1369840	Why are you even reciting it?
1370560	1371920	Or why should I even go pray?
1371920	1373440	I don't even understand what's being said.
1373440	1375680	Isn't it more important that I just read the translation?
1376640	1378560	That's cool for here.
1379520	1380640	But the recitation,
1380720	1383200	exact words given by Allah,
1383200	1384080	that's good for what?
1384640	1386560	For here, that's for the Qaylim.
1386560	1388080	So those are two separate things
1388080	1390400	that we have to work on simultaneously.
1390400	1392400	The advantage that the Arabs had,
1392400	1393040	the Ummeyin,
1393040	1394560	the first Ummeyin had,
1394560	1395840	was when they heard the Quran,
1395840	1398000	they were understanding it at the same time.
1398000	1399360	So their recitation,
1399360	1400480	and their thinking about it,
1400480	1402400	was happening simultaneously.
1402400	1404000	Now the rest of us are not Arabs.
1404000	1405440	So we got until we learn Arabic,
1405440	1406880	we got to separate those two projects.
1407760	1410480	Until, and it evolved ourselves until the time
1410640	1413040	where those two projects can work hand in hand together.
1413040	1413440	Right?
1413440	1414000	So,
1414000	1417200	بيت سمثاً والقوم الندينة كذبوا بيعيات الده
1417200	1419360	What a terrible example of the nation
1420080	1422000	that lied against the ayat of Allah.
1422000	1423520	The scary part here is,
1423520	1424080	تقذيب,
1424080	1425600	lying against the ayat of Allah
1425600	1427760	is a phrase used for Mushriqeen.
1427760	1429600	It's a phrase used for kafirin.
1429600	1431680	It's a phrase used for those who rejected the Prophet,
1431680	1433760	rejected the Quran, rejected Revelation.
1433760	1434480	And Allah is saying,
1434480	1437040	the people who were scholars of Revelation,
1437040	1439840	He considers them people who lied against the Revelation
1439840	1440720	that they believed it.
1441920	1442720	You know?
1442720	1443040	They say,
1443040	1444640	نُوْمِنُوْ بِمَا وُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا
1444640	1445120	Allah says,
1445120	1447040	وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِمَا وَرَأَهُوا
1447040	1447360	They say,
1447360	1448560	We believe in what we have.
1449440	1450640	We don't have to follow yours.
1450640	1452160	We already believe in what?
1452160	1452640	We have.
1452640	1453920	And Allah says,
1453920	1455760	No, they deny what is with them.
1456320	1457840	They disbelieve in even what is with them.
1458960	1459840	I was actually,
1459840	1461520	for a long time I thought this is just,
1461520	1461920	you know,
1461920	1462560	Allah is saying this,
1462560	1464000	but there's no way to prove it.
1464000	1466720	That they actually know that the Quran
1466720	1467920	is also the word of Allah.
1468880	1471840	Until I heard about Rabbi Abramson
1472560	1474000	on Facebook actually,
1474000	1474800	and I follow him.
1474800	1477760	I look up what he says every now and then.
1478400	1480160	Great scholar of rabbinic tradition,
1480160	1481120	a Rabbi,
1481120	1483360	and also a student of Hadith actually.
1483360	1484800	So he's an Arabic student of Hadith.
1485680	1488880	And he's answered many Muslim questions about the Quran
1488880	1492960	and several Orthodox Jewish scholars
1492960	1494480	believe that Muhammad,
1494480	1495840	sallallahu alayhi wa sallam,
1495840	1497520	is in fact a messenger of Allah.
1497920	1498560	According to them,
1498560	1500800	they have a checklist of how many things,
1501440	1502560	how many proofs do you need
1502560	1504800	before you declare someone a prophet of God.
1504800	1505280	They,
1505280	1507120	the prophet said according to them,
1507120	1508880	meets all of the criteria,
1509840	1510720	all of them.
1510720	1512080	So they believe him,
1512080	1514720	a good number of Orthodox rabbis,
1514720	1517520	believe him to be a messenger of Allah even today,
1518160	1520080	but they say he's just not for us.
1521520	1522640	He's for everyone else.
1522640	1524080	He's great for everyone else.
1524080	1525040	We have what we have.
1525120	1527280	We're in a different category.
1527280	1528000	You see?
1528000	1530720	To me, that's mind blowing.
1530720	1533440	It's mind blowing that they come that far
1533440	1534480	and then they step back.
1534480	1535120	But they do,
1535120	1536560	and they're not even hiding it anymore.
1536560	1537600	They actually say it.
1537600	1538640	They actually say it.
1538640	1539440	Say it, you know?
1539440	1540480	So,
1540480	1542880	I'll make a post about that soon.
1542880	1544080	I'll put it on Facebook.
1544080	1545760	I'll share some of his posts with you guys.
1545760	1546960	So you know who I'm talking about,
1546960	1548400	inshallah.
1548400	1549440	But,
1549520	1550800	inshallah.
1550800	1551680	But,
1556080	1556960	What is Allah saying?
1556960	1558320	If you deny one ayah,
1558880	1561680	it's the same as you denying all of it.
1562640	1563440	You can't say,
1563440	1565680	oh, I like Moses,
1565680	1567040	but I'm not a fan of Jesus.
1568160	1568720	You can't do,
1568720	1570400	oh, I like Moses and Jesus.
1570400	1571600	Muhammad, you know,
1572720	1573280	you can't do that.
1573280	1573760	You can't say,
1573760	1574960	oh, I like Jibreel,
1574960	1576160	but Amikaela,
1577280	1577600	you know,
1577920	1581120	so if you start picking and choosing,
1581680	1582240	Allah says,
1582240	1586240	من كان عدوة الناهي ورسولي وجبريلا وميكال
1586240	1587840	فإن الله عدوة الكافري
1588640	1590240	That's why at the end of Surat Al-Baqarah,
1590240	1592000	whoever becomes an enemy to Allah
1592000	1594160	and his messengers and Jibreel and Mika'al,
1594160	1596160	then Allah is an enemy to all those who disbelieve.
1596160	1597200	Meaning,
1597200	1598640	this is one unity.
1598640	1599040	Allah,
1600000	1600560	the source,
1601440	1602320	the angels,
1602320	1603040	the delivery,
1603680	1604480	the messengers,
1604480	1605200	the recipient.
1605920	1607200	This one chain.
1607280	1608400	It's a supply chain.
1608400	1608720	Yeah.
1609280	1612080	You deny any part of this supply chain,
1612080	1612960	the chain is broken.
1613840	1614880	That it doesn't count.
1614880	1616880	That's why we say at the end of Surat Al-Baqarah,
1616880	1617600	Allah makes us say
1620160	1622160	We don't distinguish between any of his messengers.
1623040	1624080	We accept all of them.
1624720	1625600	And that is the,
1625600	1627600	that was the demand made from them.
1628320	1629920	The first kufr they did,
1629920	1630800	according to the Qur'an,
1630800	1633520	the first major kufr that the Israelites did
1633520	1634960	was actually against Isa A'ab,
1635600	1637200	when they denied his Rasada.
1637200	1638800	They've committed many crimes before,
1638800	1639840	killed prophets before,
1639840	1641040	did terrible crimes.
1641040	1641280	Those are,
1641280	1642480	those have been already mentioned.
1643120	1644800	But the major crime
1644800	1645760	with their first kufr,
1645760	1646880	the takdeeb of the
1646880	1648560	Kitab of Allah completely,
1648560	1649760	there's one thing to accept it
1649760	1650400	and play games with it.
1650400	1652080	It's another to just deny it completely,
1652080	1653280	was what was sent to them
1653280	1654480	through Isa A'ab.
1654480	1655920	And then the second time
1655920	1657440	is with Muhammadur Rasulullah,
1657440	1658720	Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.
1658720	1659520	This is big sa,
1661520	1662240	and finally,
1662240	1663200	the last part
1663200	1664640	and the scariest part,
1665200	1666480	is the Qulamah of the Alibeen.
1666480	1667120	Allah does not,
1667120	1668720	Allah does not guide
1668720	1669760	wrongdoing people.
1669760	1671600	Allah did not mention this in the past tense.
1671600	1673440	He mentions this in the present and future tense.
1674080	1674560	Why?
1674560	1676560	Because the whole point of this example is not
1681520	1683280	Allah does not guide them.
1683280	1684400	Allah will not guide them.
1685200	1686400	Or Allah will not guide those
1686400	1687520	who were given the Torah.
1687520	1688640	That's not what he said.
1688640	1689120	Allah said,
1689120	1691040	Allah didn't say Allah will not guide the Jews.
1691040	1692160	That's not what he said.
1692160	1693520	He said Allah will not guide
1693520	1694800	the wrongdoing people.
1695520	1696960	Now the wrongdoing people
1696960	1698320	is an adjective, isn't it?
1699840	1701760	Which noun fits this adjective?
1701760	1703600	Any noun could fit this adjective.
1704320	1705680	You and I could become
1705680	1706640	Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.
1707920	1709360	They could be Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.
1710240	1711840	Christians could become Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.
1711840	1713360	Anybody could become Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.
1713360	1714160	So at the end,
1714160	1715920	this warning at the end,
1715920	1716800	is to come back,
1716800	1718160	this is called the Jadid.
1718160	1719840	We went into the example,
1719840	1721440	now we're out of the example.
1721440	1723440	Now we're back to the universal principle.
1723840	1725600	Don't become Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.
1726320	1728160	Because I will not guide you if that happens.
1728960	1731440	Aya 2 was about how he gave guidance.
1732000	1736080	And Aya 3 is when will people lose guidance, isn't it?
1736880	1738960	That's the relationship between 2 and 3.
1738960	1740400	2 was he sent a messenger.
1740400	1742000	This is how he delivered guidance.
1742000	1743280	And now Allah is saying,
1743280	1745360	Yep, and now if you do this,
1745360	1746720	then even if you have the book,
1747760	1749120	even if you have the book,
1749120	1750960	even if you become scholars of the book,
1751680	1753600	you'll just be donkeys that will not be guided.
1754480	1755040	You won't have it,
1755040	1756320	you'll have it without you,
1756320	1757920	you'll be deprived of it
1757920	1759360	while having it at the same time.
1760160	1763360	That is the fear that Allah has put inside the ummah,
1763360	1766560	that they shouldn't develop that kind of tradition
1766560	1767760	with their book.
1767760	1768320	Or you know,
1768320	1769680	I go around the world,
1769680	1773120	I see many madrasas of Ta'feel of the Quran.
1773920	1775200	I'm gonna close this,
1775200	1776240	just talk to you guys.
1776240	1777440	Ta'feel of the Quran.
1777440	1779040	Meaning kids memorizing the Quran,
1779040	1779680	all over the world.
1779680	1781600	Well, Allah protect these kids, right?
1783360	1784240	Those madrasas,
1784240	1785280	instead of criticizing them,
1785280	1786640	that these kids are memorizing the Quran
1786640	1787440	and doing nothing else,
1788560	1790080	we need to make a campaign
1790080	1792000	that these kids that are memorizing the Quran
1792000	1793360	should also be given the tools
1793360	1795040	to understand what they've memorized.
1795920	1797920	Can you imagine the hundreds of thousands,
1797920	1799120	if not millions of kids
1799120	1800480	that are memorizing the Quran,
1801040	1801920	all become
1803040	1804160	duaat of the Quran.
1804960	1805600	All can,
1805600	1807920	they can speak about any eye of the Quran intelligently.
1808800	1810800	At a basic level.
1810800	1811520	They know what it means,
1811520	1812800	they can share it with somebody else.
1813600	1816240	Can you imagine just these millions of Quran carriers
1816240	1816800	walking around?
1817840	1818320	You know?
1818320	1819680	And they don't even have to open it.
1820560	1821520	It's already inside.
1822160	1822720	They're carried.
1822720	1825280	So I don't criticize those institutions.
1825280	1825760	I say,
1825760	1826000	hey,
1826800	1828080	you've done the hard part already.
1829200	1830800	All we gotta do now is make sure
1830800	1832640	that we don't raise a generation
1832640	1833520	that looks like
1834800	1836160	khimar yahmi al wasfara,
1836160	1836880	we don't want this.
1837600	1839520	And I'm not calling those children this,
1839520	1840480	but this is not a fear
1841360	1842640	that they just have these words
1842640	1844320	and they have no connection
1844320	1845040	with what they mean.
1845920	1847200	And when you ask them what they mean,
1847200	1848480	also don't ask somebody else.
1848480	1848960	That's not me.
1848960	1849760	I just memorize it.
1850560	1851440	I just memorize it.
1851440	1852320	Oh no, no.
1852320	1853280	There's no excuse.
1853920	1855200	The Oma has no excuse.
1856000	1856480	And you can't,
1856480	1857600	we can't even make the excuse,
1857600	1858400	oh, it's Arabic.
1858400	1859440	Arabic is so hard, bro.
1859440	1860240	You learn English.
1861920	1862720	You learn German.
1864880	1865840	But didn't you?
1865840	1866880	Muslims moved to Russia.
1866880	1867440	What did they learn?
1868320	1868800	Russian.
1868800	1870240	I met Muslims in China.
1870240	1871200	They learned Chinese.
1872400	1873120	You can learn Chinese.
1873120	1874640	You can learn Arabic is so hard, though.
1875840	1876160	Really?
1877680	1879600	You, you can,
1879600	1880800	you can read blockchain.
1883280	1884240	You can read code.
1885760	1886480	You can read that,
1887040	1888080	but you can't learn Arabic.
1888080	1889920	You know, this is not an excuse.
1889920	1892080	It's just we haven't put the emphasis on it
1892080	1893760	because we started believing
1893760	1895520	reciting the Quran is enough.
1897040	1899520	Hearing it's beautifully recited is enough.
1899520	1901760	That is the relationship we need with the Quran.
1901760	1903440	That is what we should put our money and time
1903440	1904480	and resources in.
1904480	1906960	If that same money and time and resources and energy
1906960	1908720	was going into memorizing Quran
1908720	1910560	and understanding the Quran at the same time,
1911600	1913120	you would look like a different Oma.
1913120	1915120	I honestly believe we would look like a different Oma.
1916080	1918560	There's no way that our millions of kids
1918560	1919840	would carry the Quran in their heart
1919840	1921040	and it wouldn't affect their hearts.
1921600	1922000	You know?
1922800	1925120	It wouldn't affect our overall comprehension
1925120	1926960	and when someone says something crazy,
1926960	1929120	immediately, wait, Allah says something else.
1930000	1932640	We'd be a wikipedia Oma.
1933440	1933680	Right?
1933680	1935440	So every time something wrong comes,
1935440	1937360	there's a surge of correction
1937360	1938880	because everybody's carrying the Quran.
1939440	1940880	Everybody's carrying it,
1940880	1943440	which is why I think there's a lot of potential
1943440	1944880	in the next generations now.
1945600	1947200	What I saw, the Oma has been through
1947200	1949600	a very depressing situation for a long time,
1950160	1951360	but what I see now,
1951360	1953120	Allah o Adam, I see a rise.
1954000	1955920	I just, wherever I go, I see a rise.
1955920	1958480	I see a new generation of Muslims
1958480	1959920	that are more curious,
1959920	1962000	more investigating, more thoughtful.
1962000	1963920	I meet 13 year olds that are smarter
1963920	1965280	than I was when I was 25.
1966080	1967920	Very commonly, they come and ask questions all the time.
1967920	1969520	I was really stupid at your age.
1971040	1974720	Like, you're way too smart for this age.
1975280	1977280	You know, there's a higher level of intelligence,
1977280	1978800	there's a higher level of curiosity.
1978800	1980720	Yes, the dumb people are dumber
1980800	1981680	than ever before,
1983360	1986000	but arguably smart people are also
1986800	1987920	smarter than ever before.
1988640	1990960	There's more potential now than ever before.
1990960	1992720	And I see a huge opportunity.
1993440	1995440	I see a massive, massive opportunity,
1995440	1996640	something within our grasp.
1996640	1997840	It's low-hanging fruit.
1997840	1999200	It's not some impossible dream.
1999920	2002320	And to me, that is what is,
2002320	2004720	inshaAllah, going to reverse this tide
2004720	2007920	of the majority of us just becoming disconnected
2007920	2008800	with the word of Allah.
2008800	2009360	Look at that.
2009360	2011840	Look at how strongly Allah criticized those
2011840	2013280	who didn't live up to the Torah.
2013840	2016240	Doesn't the Quran deserve much more than the Torah?
2017600	2020160	The final word of Allah meant for all of humanity,
2020160	2021440	the great word of Allah,
2021440	2022880	the exact word of Allah,
2022880	2024320	doesn't it deserve so much more?
2024880	2027280	And if we fall, if Allah is criticizing them
2027280	2029280	with the analogy of the Himmah,
2030400	2032560	and don't we deserve much worse criticism
2032560	2033920	if we fall short?
2034720	2035760	That's the scary thing.
2035760	2037840	So may Allah Azza wa Jalla make us a people
2037920	2041840	that rise above this state that we're in
2041840	2043760	and we become part of the solution.
2043760	2045600	We become part of raising generations
2045600	2047520	that are going to be deeply, deeply connected
2047520	2048720	with the word of Allah
2048720	2051200	and have a real loyalty to its messenger,
2051200	2051920	sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
2051920	2053520	Okay, so I'm going to conclude here, inshaAllah.
2055040	2056240	Salaamu alaikum everyone.
2056240	2058960	There are almost 50,000 students around the world
2058960	2061200	that are interested on top of the students we have
2061200	2063360	in studying the Quran and its meanings
2063360	2064480	and being able to learn that
2064480	2066080	and share that with family and friends.
2066080	2067360	And they need sponsorships,
2067360	2068560	which is not very expensive.
2068560	2071440	So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV,
2071440	2073280	please do so and visit our sponsorship page.
2073280	2074480	I appreciate it so much
2074480	2076080	and pray that Allah gives our mission success
2076080	2078080	and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran
2078080	2079920	and the beauty of it the world over.
