1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
So the donkey that was trying to get rid of its burden ended up

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,520
carrying even more, which is an interesting analogy because the Israelites,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,040
they tried to play with the word of Allah and the more they tried to play with it,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,320
life became more and more difficult for them.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,720
Three more complications came in their life.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,480
Obeying the word of Allah makes life easy.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,240
Disobeying the word of Allah makes life difficult. That is the Quran's formula.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,840
It's always been there since the beginning.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,240
Salamu alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayna TV.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,840
I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,840
in brief and then in great detail.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,960
And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanatv.com.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,440
And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV,

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,200
I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
and give it as a gift also. Thank you.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Salamu alaikum.

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Once again everybody, salamu alaikum.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
We're going to take a little bit of

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,480
closer look at some excerpts from Jewish literature,

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,920
from Jewish scholarly literature.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,080
This is something called the Sefri Debarim.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,680
It's a Midrash compilation. Midrash is one of their earliest scholarly works,

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,120
kind of the Tafseer work from the third and the fifth century.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,600
And it's called an analogy of the Jews and the Gentiles,

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,080
basically the believers and the Umayyim.

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,480
So Gentiles, the Goyim, are the Umayyim to them.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,280
Okay. And here's the analogy. Listen to this carefully. I'll explain as we go.

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
A man sent his donkey and his dog to the granary,

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,000
where 15 saha of grain, basically 15 bags of grain,

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,160
were loaded atop the donkey and three on the dog.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,600
So 15 on the donkey, three on the dog.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,080
The donkey walked and the dog strained to breathe his tongue lolling.

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,240
He cast aside one saha and placed it atop the donkey.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Then he then sent the same with the second and then the third.

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,880
This is how Israel accepted the Torah,

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,080
together with its commentaries and its minutiae.

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
Even those seven commandments that the Noah hides,

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,480
meaning the survivors from the time of Nukh Ali Salaam,

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,720
could not abide and cast aside. Israel came and accepted.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
Okay. So the idea in this literature is that they,

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,480
humanity, the rest of humanity could not carry the burden of revelation

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,520
and they decided to be the ones to carry it.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,320
So who gets credit? The Israelites get credit.

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,040
If you look at this ayah, Allah responds to this by saying,

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
Homilu, they were given the burden.

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
They didn't take it, they were given the burden,

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,120
so that credit is not given to them using the passive form.

49
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,920
On top of that, they didn't carry.

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
Now two animals were mentioned in this analogy.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,280
What are the two animals?

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,120
Donkey and the dog.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,880
And the donkey was able to carry the burden

54
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,840
and the dog was not able to carry the burden.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,520
It's interesting that in the Quran,

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,920
both the analogy of the donkey and the dog is used.

57
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
Responding to this, in this surah, it's the donkey

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,440
and in Surat al-A'raf, it's going to be the dog.

59
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
And literally the donkey burden too.

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,400
In tahmed alayhi al-yalhaf wa'intatruku yalhaf,

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,600
if you put a burden on the dog, it will start drooling

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,560
and if you don't put it, it will still start drooling

63
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
because they are people of dunya.

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,520
Right?

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,360
But we'll get into the dog analogy one day

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,960
when we study Surat al-A'raf,

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,600
but right now I want to tell you about the donkey analogy.

68
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,400
The idea is the donkey was able to carry the burden

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
and therefore became the hero.

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
And thus is the burden of the Israelites.

71
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
You see how Allah is using something they used

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,520
in a positive sense and re-engineering it and saying,

73
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,560
yes, you did carry it like the donkey quite literally.

74
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,560
So you didn't use just a donkey carrying books.

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,280
Is what happened.

76
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,560
Okay?

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
So that's another.

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,040
Now interesting that in the Hebrew language,

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,000
in the rabbinic text, the word for the donkey is hamur,

80
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,360
which is basically the Arabic equivalent for what?

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,880
Al-Himar.

82
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,600
Okay?

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
And yahlmulu asfara,

84
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
asfara is the word, usually in Arabic we say kutuban.

85
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
We don't say asfaran,

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,840
but the rabbis themselves use sefer for scriptures

87
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
and the plural is used in Arabic here asfar.

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,480
So Allah is actually using words in Arabic

89
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,640
that are closest to the rabbinic text.

90
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,880
So they feel a connection to what they have

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,200
when Allah is speaking too.

92
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,920
So we learn something from it and secondarily,

93
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,280
they're hearing something.

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,600
Then another dimension of the donkey study.

95
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,560
The Zohar, another Talbudic text, Hebrew text,

96
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,720
teaches that the donkey is avi awot,

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,240
haatuma, I've probably butchered that pronunciation.

98
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
The ultimate source of impurity.

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,920
What I read today was fascinating.

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,520
They consider the pig impure,

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,320
they consider the camel impure,

102
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
and they consider the donkey impure,

103
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,120
but between the three of them,

104
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
the donkey is the most impure to them.

105
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,040
So in their literature,

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
the donkey is the most impure of all the three.

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,480
In addition, the Hebrew word for donkey,

108
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,000
chamoor, shares the same root as the word for material.

109
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,760
And that's why the donkey is a symbol of materialism

110
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,360
and crassness in Jewish literature.

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
Okay, now a few interesting things here.

112
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,600
One, the donkey is the most impure.

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,280
Look at this passage.

114
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,080
What did Allah do with human beings that accept this message?

115
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,600
What is that key him?

116
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,320
Look at what they believed about themselves.

117
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,000
They believed about themselves that because they were under the mountain,

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,840
they were pure.

119
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,320
And now Allah is using the analogy of the animal

120
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,000
they consider the most impure and saying this is,

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
so he's reversing a lot of the themes

122
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
that they carried for themselves.

123
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,040
Also, you will see later on in this passage

124
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,600
that they, and one of the things we saw about them

125
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
was they love life, right?

126
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,560
They don't want to face death.

127
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,120
And they will never wish for death.

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,680
And that materialism is something that we should be afraid of in ourselves.

129
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,120
And what is the donkey a symbol of in their literature?

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
The symbol of materialism,

131
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
of just having more and more in this life

132
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,440
and not concerning yourself with the next.

133
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,240
Then there was something really interesting.

134
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,120
I was just trying to find how is their religious tradition looking at donkeys?

135
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,880
Where's the imagery of the donkey, the symbolism of the donkey?

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,920
We have it in the Quran.

137
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,280
We have this example.

138
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,080
We have

139
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,120
So we have references to the donkey in multiple places in the Quran too,

140
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,240
in different ways.

141
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,040
But the Israelites in Egypt had sunk to the lowest levels of

142
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
This is not from my literature.

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,720
This is theirs.

144
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
This is from an article I got from a Jewish website,

145
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,280
Torah study website.

146
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,960
The Israelites in Egypt had sunk to the lowest levels of idolatry and impurity.

147
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,240
Outwardly, they were indistinguishable from the Egyptian neighbors.

148
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
When they lived in Egypt,

149
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,200
the Egyptians had their Shirk-i religion.

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
And this is saying that the Banu Isra'in,

151
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,320
when they were living in Egypt,

152
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,160
they basically were following the same religion.

153
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,160
They looked like they were doing exactly the same Shirk as the Egyptians were doing.

154
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,280
According to the Midrash,

155
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,120
even the angels were unable to distinguish between the two nations.

156
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,920
They questioned God's decision to rescue the Israelites

157
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,800
at the Red Sea,

158
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,160
protesting both the Egyptians and the Israelites worship idols.

159
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,160
But as with the donkey,

160
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,120
the impurity of the Jewish people was only on the surface.

161
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
Hiding a great inner holiness.

162
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,920
Maybe you're pure on the outside,

163
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,480
but there's an inner holiness on the inside.

164
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
This is actually pretty interesting.

165
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,960
They believe that doesn't matter how impure the donkey is,

166
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,920
he's pure on the inside.

167
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,960
Why is he pure on the inside?

168
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,320
Where did the purity come from?

169
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,080
Well, when they escaped Egypt,

170
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
they escaped a lot on donkeys.

171
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,960
Donkeys carried their gold, their items,

172
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,640
and carried all their burdens.

173
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,760
So they escaped.

174
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,800
So the donkey became a symbol of their rescue from Egypt,

175
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,640
even though the donkey is impure.

176
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,720
So then they developed this entire philosophy

177
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,320
that even though we are impure,

178
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,840
God will still save us.

179
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,360
Like the donkey is impure,

180
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,600
and he still was a means to be saved.

181
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,720
Right?

182
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
Now what are the Quran say,

183
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,040
qunubuna ulf?

184
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Our hearts are saved.

185
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,960
Deep inside, remember?

186
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
It's quite literally that commentary.

187
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,360
Now they believe there's a Messiah coming.

188
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,600
So they believe in their literature.

189
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,760
And we already know that Allah told us

190
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,600
that they were told from the very beginning

191
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,040
that the Prophet will come.

192
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,720
It's in Surat Al-A'raf.

193
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:40,880
Right?

194
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,160
So they have some version of that.

195
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,000
They call that the Messiah is coming.

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,560
Okay?

197
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,040
Now, let the Messiah come.

198
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,400
And may I merit to sit in the shadow of his donkey's dung.

199
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
The Rabbi says,

200
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,320
if only I could just be when the Rasul comes,

201
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,600
and I could be around even his donkey and his donkey's poo,

202
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,080
that'd be in the shadow of his donkey's dung.

203
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,280
That'd be good for me.

204
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,880
Once again, we find the metaphor

205
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
of the donkey used in connection

206
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
with the messianic era.

207
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

208
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:08,960
This is...

209
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm gonna...

210
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,280
Let me explain this to you before I read for a game.

211
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,400
So what happens is they believe that a Messiah will come.

212
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,280
But either the Messiah will come from the sky

213
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
or he will come riding on a donkey.

214
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,640
Two ways.

215
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,440
If the Israelites are good and they're pure

216
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,960
and they don't do any sins and they become clean,

217
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,600
then the Messiah will come from the sky like a miracle.

218
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,960
But if the Israelites have become sinful

219
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,240
and they're dirty and they've made a lot of mistakes,

220
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,120
they will still be saved

221
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
because the Messiah will come and save them.

222
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,200
But this time he will come on a donkey,

223
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
but they'll still be purified.

224
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,680
They'll still be...

225
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
And by the way, the word is really interesting.

226
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
Now that you understand that,

227
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,880
the Rabbi here is saying that I'm pretty sure

228
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,680
he's gonna come on a donkey because we're pretty messed up.

229
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,000
That's what he's basically saying.

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,320
Okay.

231
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,040
Especially the part that even Israel does not deserve it.

232
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
Meaning if they don't deserve a Messiah,

233
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
then he will come on a donkey.

234
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,880
They will get the Messiah to redeem them.

235
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,520
It's just that the Messiah in that case

236
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,800
will come riding on a donkey.

237
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,400
Looking at the Hebrew in the Talmud,

238
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,520
the word for deserving is actually the word

239
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,080
a zekah, purification in Arabic.

240
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,600
Allah is purifying their concept of purification.

241
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480
Because their concept was no matter what,

242
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,080
in the end we will be saved.

243
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,720
No matter what, even if we're not deserving,

244
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
the Messiah will come and rescue us.

245
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,480
So the word Safar, which is used in the ayah,

246
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,960
is actually in the Arabic language,

247
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,520
Safar...

248
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,840
I think everybody knows Safar, Musafiq, travel, right?

249
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,480
And Ms. Safar is a blade to remove something.

250
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,880
And Fara Safar is a slender horse.

251
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,960
Basically the idea of Safar is movement.

252
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,200
The idea of Safar is movement.

253
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
And the Asfah are volumes and rolls and rolls and rolls

254
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
of their books, their literature.

255
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
They didn't have books like this, like open like this.

256
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,800
They're rolls on both ends.

257
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
So there's two sides that roll together,

258
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,560
and then you open them up, right?

259
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,120
So there's like...

260
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,400
It's a long, long, long scroll,

261
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,560
and they write each one of them one at a time,

262
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,720
and they roll them together to get to a certain page.

263
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,760
They roll both sides of it to get to a certain page, okay?

264
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,680
This is actually referred to in Surat al-Tur.

265
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,960
One of those is...

266
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,200
Right?

267
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
That's actually referring to the Torah.

268
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,640
Okay?

269
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
So that's the word used.

270
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,240
It's very logical because in that kind of a design,

271
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,480
you have to literally travel with the material.

272
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,080
You have to actually navigate the text

273
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,280
and roll the pages as you go, okay?

274
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,240
So...

275
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,360
Okay.

276
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,640
Now, the imagery of sharing books.

277
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,520
Let's talk about that.

278
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:05,760
Let's...

279
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,440
There's something called...

280
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,120
Ataswi'l al-Fani, like the Quran paints a picture.

281
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,200
So now the picture in my mind is there's a donkey,

282
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,720
and there's a bunch of loaded sacks of scrolls,

283
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,240
sacred scrolls of the Israelite rabbis that are on it.

284
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,640
Why would the scrolls be on here?

285
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,560
Well, the Israelites, they moved a lot, right?

286
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,160
They were attacked and they had to move,

287
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,640
and they were attacked and they had to move again,

288
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,680
and one of the most precious, valuable things they had is their Torah,

289
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
which is on these large, large scrolls.

290
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,360
So they had to move them on the back of a donkey.

291
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,200
So go from one place to another to another.

292
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,640
Also, when one rabbi dies,

293
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,680
or when one rabbi passes responsibility to another rabbi,

294
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,840
they have to deliver the Torah.

295
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
How are they going to deliver it?

296
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,600
It's too large.

297
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,960
They're going to put it on a donkey, right?

298
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,600
So now the image of the delivery system,

299
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
their way of delivering a package,

300
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,640
the Torah package is actually by way of donkeys.

301
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,680
But why is that analogy being used?

302
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,760
It is as if to say it's just the donkey carrying the load from one place to another,

303
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,280
then from another place to another,

304
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,640
then from another place to another,

305
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,400
and it's just a transfer of these scrolls,

306
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,240
but nobody's actually reading these scrolls.

307
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,520
It's just an empty delivery.

308
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,520
It's just passing down.

309
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,640
So the book no longer has meaning,

310
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,560
it's just something that gets passed down.

311
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
One thing that really scared me about this analogy

312
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
is that in the country I come from,

313
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,400
and I don't know if many of you come from different countries,

314
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,360
but in Muslim countries,

315
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,760
we have this tradition that we want to make sure,

316
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,800
it doesn't matter if our child knows Arabic or not,

317
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
learns their Dean or not, whatever,

318
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
we have to get someone to come to the house

319
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,120
and make sure they read the Quran from the Fatihah to the Nast.

320
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,640
They did the khatamah of the Quran,

321
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,680
now they're done with the Quran,

322
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,800
they can move on with their life.

323
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,600
And that child, when they grew up,

324
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,920
they're like, my parents made me finish the Quran,

325
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,600
I need to make sure my child also

326
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,120
finishes the Quran.

327
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,520
They call the, did you finish Quran?

328
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,760
I love that phrase, it's a very deadly phrase.

329
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,960
Did you finish the Quran?

330
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,160
You're finished, bro.

331
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,920
The Quran's not finished.

332
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,640
You can't finish the Quran.

333
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,320
Stop mortal combat.

334
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,640
Okay?

335
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,720
But you're basically, you're done with it,

336
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
you don't need that anymore.

337
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,640
And it's just an empty exercise,

338
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,320
a ritual passed down from one generation to another to another,

339
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
where the father or the mother,

340
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,560
no less, no nothing of the Quran,

341
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,840
neither does the child,

342
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,120
but it's just being delivered,

343
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,760
like just a mindless passing down.

344
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,880
There's an interesting parallel in his story

345
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,800
that is also about the Israelites,

346
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,520
about how their leaders,

347
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,200
when they escaped Egypt,

348
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,840
they had lots of donkeys and, you know,

349
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,880
different people had animals,

350
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
but a lot of people had jewelry.

351
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,040
And they didn't want,

352
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,160
when they're walking in the desert,

353
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
they accidentally, their jewelry falls out of their pocket,

354
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,240
and now it's lost in the desert.

355
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,400
So they all collected all of their jewelry,

356
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,000
and they gave it to some of their leaders

357
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
to carry on their donkeys,

358
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,480
and to carry with them, right?

359
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,920
So the leaders were carrying everybody's valuable assets.

360
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:10,880
Okay?

361
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,960
And what happened is,

362
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
the leaders were really scared

363
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
that they were carrying everybody's valuable assets,

364
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
because if somebody comes and attacks,

365
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,360
they're not going to attack the empty donkeys.

366
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,640
They're going to,

367
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,160
the leaders are going to get killed first,

368
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,840
because the privilege of carrying everybody's money

369
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,600
also came with a lot of responsibility.

370
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,200
So what happened then,

371
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,840
when Musa Aleyh said I'm left to speak with Allah,

372
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,600
behind him, Samiri came and said,

373
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,040
hey, Musa's gone,

374
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,760
and the only way we're going to get our prayers answered

375
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,560
is by way of,

376
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,360
he came up with this scheme of designing a cow, right?

377
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,000
Where's he going to get the materials to make the cow?

378
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,960
From the gold and whatever they had left.

379
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,640
But all of that was not with them,

380
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,600
that was with their leaders.

381
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,200
So the people rushed to the leaders and said,

382
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,000
give us all our gold,

383
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,640
give us the gold,

384
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,840
we need the gold right now.

385
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,120
Why did they need the gold?

386
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
Because they wanted to put it all together,

387
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,400
melt it and turn it into a calf.

388
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,400
So the leaders were like,

389
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,200
instead of stopping,

390
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,640
they were like, please take it,

391
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,840
I don't want to be the one to die.

392
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,840
Go ahead, just take it.

393
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,160
So,

394
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
We were carried,

395
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
we were made to carry the burdens

396
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,720
of the good things,

397
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,440
the beautiful things,

398
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
being the jewelry of the people.

399
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,560
But the moment they told us,

400
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,280
take, get rid of it,

401
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,000
we were happily,

402
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,880
we just threw it away,

403
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,760
we just got rid of it.

404
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,400
There's also an imagery of,

405
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,240
you're given a heavy responsibility,

406
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,680
but you just want to be done away with it.

407
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,760
You don't want to deal with that responsibility.

408
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,240
Right?

409
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,520
And that's also inside,

410
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,840
Yehmi al-Asfara bi-samatanu qaumin

411
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,200
dathinakadzebu bi-ayatina.

412
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,600
Now,

413
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,960
we don't have to get into the,

414
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:44,960
actually,

415
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,080
now I'll just talk to you a little bit

416
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,360
and we'll wrap it up today, inshallah.

417
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,080
Now,

418
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,000
the analogy of donkey being carried,

419
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,280
to made to carry burdens,

420
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,200
donkeys are actually animals

421
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,560
that endure a lot of pain,

422
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,560
because human beings have used them

423
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,080
to go up mountains

424
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,040
and to put more and more

425
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,880
and heavier and heavier loads on them.

426
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,040
And donkeys do everything they can to just,

427
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,120
any way they can just get rid of the burden somehow.

428
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,640
They can just drop some,

429
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,080
they lean sometimes

430
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,640
and try to,

431
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,000
you know, get rid of it.

432
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,800
And then what their owners do is,

433
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,520
so that they don't,

434
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,600
they're not able to tip over,

435
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,440
they put the kind of load on them

436
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,720
that half of it is on one side

437
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,320
and half of it is on the other side.

438
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,960
So they're kind of,

439
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,160
now they double the load,

440
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,440
right?

441
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,720
And then they figure there's,

442
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,760
when they were carrying one,

443
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,840
because if you put it right on top of the body,

444
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,280
it's one kind of weight.

445
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,960
But if they try to get rid of it,

446
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,680
then the owner says,

447
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,240
okay, you know what,

448
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,480
I'll just split it on either side.

449
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
But then the owner realizes,

450
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,120
I could put a lot more on here now.

451
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,240
Right?

452
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,560
So the donkey that was trying to get rid of its burden

453
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,360
ended up carrying even more,

454
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
which is an interesting analogy

455
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,680
because the Israelites,

456
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,600
they tried to play with the word of Allah

457
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
and the more they tried to play with it,

458
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
life became more and more difficult for them.

459
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,880
Three more complications came in their life.

460
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
Obeying the word of Allah makes life easy.

461
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,120
Disobeying the word of Allah makes life difficult.

462
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
That is the Quran's formula.

463
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
It's always been there since the beginning.

464
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,360
That's why Allah says,

465
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,240
You read Allah will be

466
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,600
You kafifa al-kum.

467
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
Allah intends to make your burden

468
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,560
easy, lighter.

469
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,000
Wa quli qad ilsanu dha'ifa

470
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,360
Human beings were created weak.

471
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,840
Marriage was made easy.

472
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,600
Divorce was made easy.

473
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,360
Inheritance was made easy.

474
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
Prayer was made easy.

475
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,560
Zakat was made easy.

476
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,200
All matters in Islam are actually

477
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,120
things that make life easy.

478
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,800
And all the things you'll notice,

479
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,360
all the things that are prohibited in Islam,

480
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,920
like alcohol or gambling or any,

481
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,520
all of them are either addictions

482
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
or if you stay in them,

483
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,640
they create a lot of difficulties.

484
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
Like even if they feel good in the moment,

485
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
they will create like enormous

486
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,560
long-term burdens and difficulties.

487
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,200
So the thing, the law of Allah,

488
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,560
the purpose of the law of Allah

489
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,960
is actually to make the burden lighter.

490
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,520
But when they didn't follow the exact law of Allah,

491
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,600
the burden kept getting heavier and heavier

492
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,880
and heavier and heavier and heavier

493
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,600
on the like ad-danki that is being made

494
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,040
to carry so much load.

495
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,360
There's also a pretty storm criticism.

496
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
Ad-danki doesn't understand what it's carrying.

497
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,280
But the rabbis did understand

498
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,000
the Torah.

499
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,720
They didn't.

500
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,400
So there's a contradiction in the parallel.

501
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,200
The animal doesn't understand what it's carrying.

502
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
But the scholars of the Torah

503
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,040
understood what they were carrying.

504
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,320
Allah is saying that kind of understanding

505
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,400
is as good as not understanding at all.

506
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,320
Scary that you can know something,

507
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
but if you know the word of Allah,

508
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,920
but you're not benefiting from it,

509
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,360
you're not living by it,

510
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,240
it's Kitab and not Hikmah, right?

511
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,160
Then there's the word of Allah.

512
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,880
Then there's no difference between an animal

513
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,560
who doesn't know it at all.

514
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,680
There's, in other words, there's real,

515
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,320
there's the real knowing of the book

516
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,400
and there's the artificial knowing of the book.

517
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,760
And we have to be afraid that our relationship

518
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
with the Quran will no longer be real,

519
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,080
it will become artificial.

520
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,520
That's the scary part.

521
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,480
Which is why I want to,

522
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,680
before I end this session,

523
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,440
I want to take you back to the second ayah

524
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,320
for a quick moment.

525
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,960
We, you know, the recitation of the Quran,

526
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,160
the recitation of the Quran should be beautified.

527
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
And if you don't know how to recite the Quran with the Jwi,

528
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,360
and you don't know how to recite the Quran

529
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
melodiously, for example,

530
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
this is something you should work on for yourself.

531
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
You should, one, be listening.

532
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,480
If you like listening to a recitation of the Quran,

533
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
that Haqqari that you like,

534
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,200
somebody that you enjoy listening to,

535
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
listen to them, put them on and listen to them,

536
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,600
make a habit out of listening to the Quran.

537
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,760
While you're the study of the Quran

538
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,800
and the engagement with the Quran,

539
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,080
that all has its purpose.

540
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
But listening to the recitation of the Quran

541
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,560
has its own purpose.

542
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,080
But ultimately, even the listening should be replaced

543
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,560
with what?

544
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,400
With yourself reciting the Quran.

545
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,200
And you have to,

546
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
you have to try to work on that

547
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,520
to the point where you start enjoying reciting the Quran.

548
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,280
And when you do that,

549
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,720
that is actually when you're starting

550
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,880
to have a real relationship with the Quran.

551
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,520
People say,

552
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,440
I want a relationship with the Quran.

553
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,560
The relationship with the Quran

554
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,000
is not just going to come from study.

555
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,480
That's going to be an intellectual relationship.

556
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,680
But a real relationship with the Quran,

557
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,760
the emotional bond with the Quran,

558
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,680
your heart is attached to the Quran,

559
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,960
that's going to come from recitation.

560
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,560
That's not going to come from the Seer study.

561
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
That's not going to come from listening to lectures.

562
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,600
That's another department,

563
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,480
two different departments, you know?

564
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,560
And that deserves its own attention.

565
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,280
I can tell you,

566
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,920
the study of the Quran,

567
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,320
when these weeks,

568
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,840
when I'm teaching Quran week,

569
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
I'm all up in Quran study.

570
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,720
Right?

571
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,480
At the moment this week is done,

572
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm not studying any Quran.

573
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,680
I'm just reciting.

574
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,080
I'm just reciting.

575
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,520
Because what I see in myself is,

576
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,160
if you focus too much on the mind,

577
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,160
then the heart starts to suffer.

578
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,040
And then you have to replenish that with the heart.

579
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,520
And you have to,

580
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,680
the recitation actually helps the heart.

581
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,040
It helps, it calms me,

582
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,640
it gives me peace.

583
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,080
You know?

584
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,600
It makes me feel connected to Allah,

585
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,560
so Allah makes me feel connected to the Quran.

586
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,240
And then when I recite it,

587
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
then it makes me more curious,

588
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,800
and it brings me back to what?

589
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,640
The study.

590
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,160
And then the study makes me want to go back to recite.

591
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,040
And there's this kind of,

592
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,480
there's the

593
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,120
يطلوع عليهم آياته ويزكيهم

594
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,080
on the one side,

595
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,640
and then يعدهم الكتابة والحكمة

596
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,360
on the other side.

597
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,960
And that should be every person's life,

598
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,800
like a little bit of time,

599
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,680
and the recitation,

600
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,960
a little bit of time in the study,

601
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,680
and you're kind of,

602
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,880
you're building your relationship

603
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,560
on both fronts with Allah's Book.

604
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,600
And don't underestimate the value of one or the other.

605
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,680
Like people say,

606
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,960
people get on extremes and say,

607
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,800
oh, you don't even understand what you're reciting.

608
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,840
Why are you even reciting it?

609
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,920
Or why should I even go pray?

610
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,440
I don't even understand what's being said.

611
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,680
Isn't it more important that I just read the translation?

612
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,560
That's cool for here.

613
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,640
But the recitation,

614
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,200
exact words given by Allah,

615
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,080
that's good for what?

616
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,560
For here, that's for the Qaylim.

617
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,080
So those are two separate things

618
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,400
that we have to work on simultaneously.

619
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
The advantage that the Arabs had,

620
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,040
the Ummeyin,

621
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,560
the first Ummeyin had,

622
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,840
was when they heard the Quran,

623
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,000
they were understanding it at the same time.

624
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,360
So their recitation,

625
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,480
and their thinking about it,

626
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,400
was happening simultaneously.

627
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
Now the rest of us are not Arabs.

628
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
So we got until we learn Arabic,

629
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,880
we got to separate those two projects.

630
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,480
Until, and it evolved ourselves until the time

631
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,040
where those two projects can work hand in hand together.

632
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,440
Right?

633
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,000
So,

634
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
بيت سمثاً والقوم الندينة كذبوا بيعيات الده

635
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,360
What a terrible example of the nation

636
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,000
that lied against the ayat of Allah.

637
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520
The scary part here is,

638
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,080
تقذيب,

639
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,600
lying against the ayat of Allah

640
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,760
is a phrase used for Mushriqeen.

641
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,600
It's a phrase used for kafirin.

642
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,680
It's a phrase used for those who rejected the Prophet,

643
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,760
rejected the Quran, rejected Revelation.

644
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,480
And Allah is saying,

645
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,040
the people who were scholars of Revelation,

646
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,840
He considers them people who lied against the Revelation

647
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,720
that they believed it.

648
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,720
You know?

649
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,040
They say,

650
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,640
نُوْمِنُوْ بِمَا وُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا

651
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,120
Allah says,

652
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,040
وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِمَا وَرَأَهُوا

653
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,360
They say,

654
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,560
We believe in what we have.

655
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,640
We don't have to follow yours.

656
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,160
We already believe in what?

657
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,640
We have.

658
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,920
And Allah says,

659
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,760
No, they deny what is with them.

660
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,840
They disbelieve in even what is with them.

661
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,840
I was actually,

662
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,520
for a long time I thought this is just,

663
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:21,920
you know,

664
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,560
Allah is saying this,

665
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,000
but there's no way to prove it.

666
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,720
That they actually know that the Quran

667
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,920
is also the word of Allah.

668
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,840
Until I heard about Rabbi Abramson

669
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,000
on Facebook actually,

670
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,800
and I follow him.

671
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,760
I look up what he says every now and then.

672
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,160
Great scholar of rabbinic tradition,

673
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,120
a Rabbi,

674
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,360
and also a student of Hadith actually.

675
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,800
So he's an Arabic student of Hadith.

676
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,880
And he's answered many Muslim questions about the Quran

677
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,960
and several Orthodox Jewish scholars

678
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,480
believe that Muhammad,

679
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,840
sallallahu alayhi wa sallam,

680
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,520
is in fact a messenger of Allah.

681
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,560
According to them,

682
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,800
they have a checklist of how many things,

683
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,560
how many proofs do you need

684
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,800
before you declare someone a prophet of God.

685
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,280
They,

686
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,120
the prophet said according to them,

687
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,880
meets all of the criteria,

688
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,720
all of them.

689
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,080
So they believe him,

690
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,720
a good number of Orthodox rabbis,

691
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,520
believe him to be a messenger of Allah even today,

692
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,080
but they say he's just not for us.

693
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,640
He's for everyone else.

694
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,080
He's great for everyone else.

695
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,040
We have what we have.

696
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,280
We're in a different category.

697
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,000
You see?

698
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,720
To me, that's mind blowing.

699
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,440
It's mind blowing that they come that far

700
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,480
and then they step back.

701
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,120
But they do,

702
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,560
and they're not even hiding it anymore.

703
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,600
They actually say it.

704
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,640
They actually say it.

705
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,440
Say it, you know?

706
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,480
So,

707
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,880
I'll make a post about that soon.

708
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,080
I'll put it on Facebook.

709
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
I'll share some of his posts with you guys.

710
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,960
So you know who I'm talking about,

711
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,400
inshallah.

712
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,440
But,

713
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,800
inshallah.

714
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,680
But,

715
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,960
What is Allah saying?

716
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,320
If you deny one ayah,

717
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,680
it's the same as you denying all of it.

718
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,440
You can't say,

719
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,680
oh, I like Moses,

720
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,040
but I'm not a fan of Jesus.

721
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,720
You can't do,

722
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,400
oh, I like Moses and Jesus.

723
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,600
Muhammad, you know,

724
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,280
you can't do that.

725
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,760
You can't say,

726
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,960
oh, I like Jibreel,

727
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,160
but Amikaela,

728
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,600
you know,

729
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,120
so if you start picking and choosing,

730
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,240
Allah says,

731
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,240
من كان عدوة الناهي ورسولي وجبريلا وميكال

732
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,840
فإن الله عدوة الكافري

733
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,240
That's why at the end of Surat Al-Baqarah,

734
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,000
whoever becomes an enemy to Allah

735
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,160
and his messengers and Jibreel and Mika'al,

736
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160
then Allah is an enemy to all those who disbelieve.

737
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,200
Meaning,

738
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,640
this is one unity.

739
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,040
Allah,

740
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,560
the source,

741
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,320
the angels,

742
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,040
the delivery,

743
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,480
the messengers,

744
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,200
the recipient.

745
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,200
This one chain.

746
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,400
It's a supply chain.

747
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:48,720
Yeah.

748
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,080
You deny any part of this supply chain,

749
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,960
the chain is broken.

750
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,880
That it doesn't count.

751
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
That's why we say at the end of Surat Al-Baqarah,

752
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,600
Allah makes us say

753
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
We don't distinguish between any of his messengers.

754
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,080
We accept all of them.

755
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,600
And that is the,

756
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
that was the demand made from them.

757
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,920
The first kufr they did,

758
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,800
according to the Qur'an,

759
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,520
the first major kufr that the Israelites did

760
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
was actually against Isa A'ab,

761
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,200
when they denied his Rasada.

762
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,800
They've committed many crimes before,

763
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,840
killed prophets before,

764
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,040
did terrible crimes.

765
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,280
Those are,

766
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,480
those have been already mentioned.

767
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,800
But the major crime

768
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,760
with their first kufr,

769
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,880
the takdeeb of the

770
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,560
Kitab of Allah completely,

771
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,760
there's one thing to accept it

772
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,400
and play games with it.

773
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,080
It's another to just deny it completely,

774
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,280
was what was sent to them

775
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,480
through Isa A'ab.

776
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,920
And then the second time

777
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,440
is with Muhammadur Rasulullah,

778
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,720
Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.

779
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,520
This is big sa,

780
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,240
and finally,

781
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,200
the last part

782
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
and the scariest part,

783
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,480
is the Qulamah of the Alibeen.

784
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,120
Allah does not,

785
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,720
Allah does not guide

786
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,760
wrongdoing people.

787
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,600
Allah did not mention this in the past tense.

788
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,440
He mentions this in the present and future tense.

789
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,560
Why?

790
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Because the whole point of this example is not

791
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,280
Allah does not guide them.

792
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,400
Allah will not guide them.

793
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,400
Or Allah will not guide those

794
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,520
who were given the Torah.

795
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,640
That's not what he said.

796
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,120
Allah said,

797
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,040
Allah didn't say Allah will not guide the Jews.

798
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,160
That's not what he said.

799
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,520
He said Allah will not guide

800
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,800
the wrongdoing people.

801
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,960
Now the wrongdoing people

802
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,320
is an adjective, isn't it?

803
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,760
Which noun fits this adjective?

804
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,600
Any noun could fit this adjective.

805
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,680
You and I could become

806
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,640
Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.

807
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,360
They could be Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.

808
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,840
Christians could become Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.

809
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,360
Anybody could become Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.

810
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,160
So at the end,

811
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,920
this warning at the end,

812
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,800
is to come back,

813
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,160
this is called the Jadid.

814
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,840
We went into the example,

815
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,440
now we're out of the example.

816
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Now we're back to the universal principle.

817
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,600
Don't become Al-Kalmahbadi Meen.

818
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,160
Because I will not guide you if that happens.

819
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,440
Aya 2 was about how he gave guidance.

820
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,080
And Aya 3 is when will people lose guidance, isn't it?

821
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,960
That's the relationship between 2 and 3.

822
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,400
2 was he sent a messenger.

823
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,000
This is how he delivered guidance.

824
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,280
And now Allah is saying,

825
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,360
Yep, and now if you do this,

826
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,720
then even if you have the book,

827
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,120
even if you have the book,

828
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
even if you become scholars of the book,

829
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,600
you'll just be donkeys that will not be guided.

830
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,040
You won't have it,

831
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,320
you'll have it without you,

832
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,920
you'll be deprived of it

833
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,360
while having it at the same time.

834
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,360
That is the fear that Allah has put inside the ummah,

835
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,560
that they shouldn't develop that kind of tradition

836
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,760
with their book.

837
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,320
Or you know,

838
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,680
I go around the world,

839
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,120
I see many madrasas of Ta'feel of the Quran.

840
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm gonna close this,

841
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,240
just talk to you guys.

842
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,440
Ta'feel of the Quran.

843
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,040
Meaning kids memorizing the Quran,

844
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,680
all over the world.

845
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,600
Well, Allah protect these kids, right?

846
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,240
Those madrasas,

847
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,280
instead of criticizing them,

848
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,640
that these kids are memorizing the Quran

849
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,440
and doing nothing else,

850
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,080
we need to make a campaign

851
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,000
that these kids that are memorizing the Quran

852
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,360
should also be given the tools

853
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,040
to understand what they've memorized.

854
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Can you imagine the hundreds of thousands,

855
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,120
if not millions of kids

856
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,480
that are memorizing the Quran,

857
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,920
all become

858
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,160
duaat of the Quran.

859
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,600
All can,

860
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,920
they can speak about any eye of the Quran intelligently.

861
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
At a basic level.

862
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,520
They know what it means,

863
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,800
they can share it with somebody else.

864
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,240
Can you imagine just these millions of Quran carriers

865
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,800
walking around?

866
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,320
You know?

867
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,680
And they don't even have to open it.

868
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,520
It's already inside.

869
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,720
They're carried.

870
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,280
So I don't criticize those institutions.

871
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,760
I say,

872
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,000
hey,

873
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,080
you've done the hard part already.

874
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,800
All we gotta do now is make sure

875
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,640
that we don't raise a generation

876
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,520
that looks like

877
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,160
khimar yahmi al wasfara,

878
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,880
we don't want this.

879
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,520
And I'm not calling those children this,

880
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,480
but this is not a fear

881
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,640
that they just have these words

882
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,320
and they have no connection

883
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,040
with what they mean.

884
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,200
And when you ask them what they mean,

885
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
also don't ask somebody else.

886
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:48,960
That's not me.

887
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,760
I just memorize it.

888
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,440
I just memorize it.

889
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,320
Oh no, no.

890
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,280
There's no excuse.

891
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,200
The Oma has no excuse.

892
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,480
And you can't,

893
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,600
we can't even make the excuse,

894
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,400
oh, it's Arabic.

895
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,440
Arabic is so hard, bro.

896
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,240
You learn English.

897
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,720
You learn German.

898
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,840
But didn't you?

899
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,880
Muslims moved to Russia.

900
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,440
What did they learn?

901
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,800
Russian.

902
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,240
I met Muslims in China.

903
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,200
They learned Chinese.

904
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,120
You can learn Chinese.

905
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,640
You can learn Arabic is so hard, though.

906
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,160
Really?

907
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,600
You, you can,

908
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,800
you can read blockchain.

909
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,240
You can read code.

910
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,480
You can read that,

911
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,080
but you can't learn Arabic.

912
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,920
You know, this is not an excuse.

913
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,080
It's just we haven't put the emphasis on it

914
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,760
because we started believing

915
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,520
reciting the Quran is enough.

916
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,520
Hearing it's beautifully recited is enough.

917
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,760
That is the relationship we need with the Quran.

918
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,440
That is what we should put our money and time

919
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,480
and resources in.

920
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,960
If that same money and time and resources and energy

921
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,720
was going into memorizing Quran

922
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,560
and understanding the Quran at the same time,

923
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,120
you would look like a different Oma.

924
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
I honestly believe we would look like a different Oma.

925
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,560
There's no way that our millions of kids

926
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,840
would carry the Quran in their heart

927
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,040
and it wouldn't affect their hearts.

928
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,000
You know?

929
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,120
It wouldn't affect our overall comprehension

930
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,960
and when someone says something crazy,

931
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,120
immediately, wait, Allah says something else.

932
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,640
We'd be a wikipedia Oma.

933
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:13,680
Right?

934
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,440
So every time something wrong comes,

935
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,360
there's a surge of correction

936
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
because everybody's carrying the Quran.

937
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,880
Everybody's carrying it,

938
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,440
which is why I think there's a lot of potential

939
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,880
in the next generations now.

940
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,200
What I saw, the Oma has been through

941
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,600
a very depressing situation for a long time,

942
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,360
but what I see now,

943
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,120
Allah o Adam, I see a rise.

944
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,920
I just, wherever I go, I see a rise.

945
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,480
I see a new generation of Muslims

946
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,920
that are more curious,

947
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,000
more investigating, more thoughtful.

948
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,920
I meet 13 year olds that are smarter

949
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,280
than I was when I was 25.

950
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,920
Very commonly, they come and ask questions all the time.

951
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,520
I was really stupid at your age.

952
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,720
Like, you're way too smart for this age.

953
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
You know, there's a higher level of intelligence,

954
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,800
there's a higher level of curiosity.

955
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,720
Yes, the dumb people are dumber

956
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,680
than ever before,

957
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,000
but arguably smart people are also

958
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,920
smarter than ever before.

959
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,960
There's more potential now than ever before.

960
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,720
And I see a huge opportunity.

961
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
I see a massive, massive opportunity,

962
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,640
something within our grasp.

963
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,840
It's low-hanging fruit.

964
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,200
It's not some impossible dream.

965
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,320
And to me, that is what is,

966
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,720
inshaAllah, going to reverse this tide

967
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,920
of the majority of us just becoming disconnected

968
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,800
with the word of Allah.

969
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,360
Look at that.

970
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,840
Look at how strongly Allah criticized those

971
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,280
who didn't live up to the Torah.

972
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,240
Doesn't the Quran deserve much more than the Torah?

973
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,160
The final word of Allah meant for all of humanity,

974
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,440
the great word of Allah,

975
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,880
the exact word of Allah,

976
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,320
doesn't it deserve so much more?

977
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,280
And if we fall, if Allah is criticizing them

978
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
with the analogy of the Himmah,

979
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,560
and don't we deserve much worse criticism

980
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,920
if we fall short?

981
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,760
That's the scary thing.

982
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,840
So may Allah Azza wa Jalla make us a people

983
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,840
that rise above this state that we're in

984
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,760
and we become part of the solution.

985
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,600
We become part of raising generations

986
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,520
that are going to be deeply, deeply connected

987
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,720
with the word of Allah

988
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,200
and have a real loyalty to its messenger,

989
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,920
sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

990
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,520
Okay, so I'm going to conclude here, inshaAllah.

991
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,240
Salaamu alaikum everyone.

992
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,960
There are almost 50,000 students around the world

993
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,200
that are interested on top of the students we have

994
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,360
in studying the Quran and its meanings

995
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,480
and being able to learn that

996
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,080
and share that with family and friends.

997
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,360
And they need sponsorships,

998
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,560
which is not very expensive.

999
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,440
So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV,

1000
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,280
please do so and visit our sponsorship page.

1001
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,480
I appreciate it so much

1002
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,080
and pray that Allah gives our mission success

1003
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,080
and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran

1004
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,920
and the beauty of it the world over.
