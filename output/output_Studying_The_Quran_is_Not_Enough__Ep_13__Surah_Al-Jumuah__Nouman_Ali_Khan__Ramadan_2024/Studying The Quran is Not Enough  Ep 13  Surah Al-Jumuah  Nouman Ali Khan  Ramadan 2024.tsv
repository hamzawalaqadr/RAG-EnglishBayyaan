0	5360	So there's a young lady sitting here who's struggling with the hijab and we say,
5360	10240	you know, these some sisters man, they don't even, let's talk for a while.
10240	13600	Bro, you don't get up for fudger every morning, which was revealed much sooner.
13600	18000	What I'm trying to tell you is, Allah didn't just give us a set of rules.
18000	21600	The Quran is not a book of rules, it's a book of transformation.
21600	24000	And transformation takes time.
24000	28000	That's why the transformation of the companions was compared to the growing of a tree.
30000	34000	Peace be upon you.
34000	40000	Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayna TV.
40000	46000	I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in brief and then in great detail.
46000	50000	And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanatv.com.
50000	58000	And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also. Thank you.
58000	62000	Bismillah wa sallam wa sallam, wa a'la rasulillah wa a'la alihi wa sahbihi ajba'een.
62000	73000	An important question that was asked that I didn't get to address is when you start studying the Quran, even for example when you're learning the Quran with me or you're listening to the Quran from somebody else or anything.
73000	77000	That is actually essentially an intellectual exercise.
77000	82000	Even if it's cleaning up your thought process, it's an intellectual cleansing.
82000	84000	But what about spiritual cleansing?
84000	87000	What about the heart feeling more connected to Allah?
87000	89000	That's a separate thing.
89000	98000	You might not feel spiritually more connected just because you're listening to a bunch of lectures or learning a bunch of stuff and studying a bunch of stuff.
98000	102000	Those are two separate things and they're equally important actually.
102000	106000	The spiritual cleansing is as important as the intellectual cleansing.
106000	108000	So what about the spiritual cleansing?
108000	118000	In my view, the Quran has described the first level of spiritual and the most powerful level of spiritual cleansing is mindful recitation of the Quran.
118000	129000	Not study of Tafsid and Tadabur, which is a separate thing, but a mindful recitation of the Quran is actually itself something that brings the heart calmness.
130000	134000	If you recite the verse,
134000	138000	when the ayatah recited onto them, it increases them in iman.
138000	141000	They feel something in their heart when they recite.
141000	144000	And you know, I could study the Quran all I want.
144000	152000	I tell you, even if I'm studying, like for example, I'm spending a lot of time studying surat al-Jumu'a nowadays with you guys, which is a different experience.
152000	157000	But when I just, at the end of the night, I just sit there and I just recite the surat.
157000	159000	Just recite it.
159000	167000	It's a different experience because the study and the note taking and the PowerPoint slides and all that stuff, that's up here.
167000	173000	Or you're just sitting and reciting to God and you're just standing in prayer and you're reciting to Allah.
173000	176000	That's not here. Where is that?
176000	180000	That's here. And you do it. Maybe you do that and you don't feel anything.
180000	182000	Maybe you recite and you don't feel anything.
182000	191000	But you know what? You keep reciting and you keep reciting and you keep reciting because the recitation is like it's drilling through the layers of your heart and heart.
191000	193000	And eventually it'll break through.
193000	196000	You will feel something, but you got to stay at it.
196000	198000	You have to say,
198000	202000	It could be that you don't feel something and that's okay.
202000	203000	That doesn't mean it's useless.
203000	206000	That means you just have more work to do, insha'Allah.
206000	211000	But recitation and even listening to recitation is actually a spiritual exercise.
211000	215000	And the bunch of people become mindful of the ayat and you listen to them.
215000	217000	It's a very powerful exercise.
217000	223000	There are surahs that I've studied for years and years and years and then I hear somebody recite them and it feels like I'm hearing it for the first time.
223000	226000	And it's so moving for me to just hear those words.
226000	229000	And that's the power that Allah's words has.
229000	233000	So that dhikr is actually something Allah has mentioned many places in the Quran.
233000	237000	And just think the words that you're reciting, when you're reciting Quran,
237000	244000	the words that are coming out of your mouth are words that were sent from above the seven heavens.
244000	253000	And there was a time when these words were being delivered by Jibril to Rasulullah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, alayhi wa sallam.
253000	261000	And now you get to say from your mouth the same words that were coming out of the mouth of the Prophet himself, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
261000	267000	So it's the word of Allah, it's the word of Jibril and it's the word of even Rasulullah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, by extension.
267000	269000	That's coming out of your mouth now.
269000	275000	It's a very profound spiritual thing that we're doing when we're reciting the word of Allah verbatim.
275000	281000	Okay, so understanding the connection between al-kitab and al-hitbah.
281000	283000	I'll talk to you a little bit about the word al-kitab.
283000	285000	Kitab is used in the Quran in many ways.
285000	287000	The word kitab is used in many ways.
287000	290000	So the phrase means he teaches them the book.
290000	292000	Literally it says it teaches them the book.
292000	294000	But what does the book mean?
294000	300000	Any decree of Allah, like Allah decreed it should reign, or Allah decreed somebody should die.
300000	302000	This is also Allah's Kitab.
302000	305000	Everything that Allah has ever decreed is in a Kitab also.
305000	309000	Fi Kitab-i Makhnoon, or Fi Kitab, right?
309000	312000	So this is one part of the meaning of Kitab.
312000	315000	But there are other meanings of Kitab.
315000	320000	Kitab also means any particular command of Allah to His slaves.
320000	321000	Okay?
321000	323000	Or any rule that Allah established.
323000	326000	I've written Allah, Allah, and the messenger.
326000	329000	Allah has declared that my messengers will win, always.
329000	331000	I and my messengers will always win.
331000	335000	Now, Kitab, the meaning of Kitab that's relevant here,
335000	337000	because you know the first part said,
337000	340000	yatlu alayhim ayaatihi, which is he recites the ayat,
340000	342000	which is clearly the Quran, right?
342000	344000	Yatlu alayhim ayaatihi is the Quran.
344000	347000	And by way of the Quran, he is purifying them.
347000	349000	So that's also kind of a reference to the Quran,
349000	352000	along with the company of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.
352000	355000	Then he teaches them the book, and of course, which book?
355000	356000	The Quran.
356000	359000	So why is it saying three different things for the same book?
359000	362000	It's because we have different relationships with the book.
362000	364000	We need to get exposed to the book,
364000	366000	we need to develop a spiritual connection to the book.
366000	368000	We use a key here.
368000	371000	We also need to understand the book,
371000	374000	the part of the book that has Allah's laws and decrees.
374000	377000	Actually, Kitab also means laws.
377000	380000	So Allah uses, for example, Kitab Allahi aleykum.
380000	383000	The law of Allah that's binding on you, Kitab Allah.
383000	386000	Qutiba aleykum al-siyam.
386000	388000	Qutiba aleykum al-kitan.
388000	392000	It says the fasting was written on you.
392000	394000	That doesn't mean written on you.
394000	396000	It actually means fasting was made law over you.
396000	399000	When something is written, it actually means it's become law.
399000	402000	It's permanent, it's actually part of the constitution.
402000	404000	That's the Kitab.
404000	408000	So here, one of the meanings is he teaches them the law.
408000	410000	He teaches them the law.
410000	413000	Now, I told you there's a subtext to these surahs,
413000	415000	and especially this surah.
415000	419000	The Israelites were listening, and the Jews particularly were people of the law.
419000	421000	They believed in al-kitab.
421000	425000	In fact, one of the ways they described the Torah is the laws.
425000	429000	It's essentially laws for them.
429000	432000	And one of the criticisms that you find,
432000	435000	the conflict between Judaism and Christianity,
435000	438000	if you study the life of Jesus,
438000	442000	is actually that they became people who only concerned themselves with the law.
442000	445000	They were only concerned with the law.
445000	448000	And there's two things I'm going to teach you today.
448000	450000	The letter of the law and the spirit of the law.
450000	453000	That's where I'm going to focus our conversation.
453000	455000	I'll make it super simple.
455000	457000	When a judge has a court case in front of him,
457000	460000	and he's about to judge some teenager or whatever, right?
460000	465000	You guys have seen those viral videos of that really nice judge in America up north?
465000	467000	I was like, so what did you do?
467000	469000	What did you do?
469000	470000	Tell me about yourself.
470000	471000	You're going to do that again?
471000	472000	You're not going to do it again, right?
472000	473000	He's a nice guy.
473000	474000	Okay, you'll go.
474000	475000	You go.
475000	477000	You know what I'm talking about?
477000	478000	The super nice judge.
478000	481000	He's also, he's judging people by the law,
481000	483000	but when he looks at their situation,
483000	485000	he looks at their difficulties,
485000	487000	then he's applying what?
487000	488000	Wisdom.
488000	490000	He's actually applying wisdom.
490000	494000	So there's, there's law, but there's also wisdom.
494000	496000	And another judge could say,
496000	498000	I'm going to throw this kid in jail
498000	501000	or I'm going to find him and I'm going to do this or that or the other.
501000	503000	They would still be applying the law,
503000	505000	but there would be less use of what?
505000	506000	Wisdom.
506000	508000	What does wisdom do?
508000	512000	What are the applications of wisdom is when should we apply the law
512000	515000	and when should we not apply the law in the strictest sense?
515000	517000	Who should we go easy on?
517000	519000	Who's not ready for this yet?
519000	520000	Where does it fit?
520000	522000	Where does it not fit?
522000	525000	So circumstantial application, you know,
525000	528000	somebody comes to the Prophet's life and asks,
528000	530000	I'm ready to become Muslim,
530000	532000	but I'm only going to pray two prayers.
532000	534000	How many prayers we have in a day?
534000	535000	He says,
535000	538000	I'm ready to pledge Islam.
538000	540000	I'm only going to pray two prayers.
540000	542000	Well, the law of Islam says what?
542000	543000	How many prayers?
543000	544000	Five.
544000	546000	But the Prophet says, okay,
546000	549000	I mean, take Shahada and he walks away.
549000	551000	And now Sahabah are thinking,
551000	554000	is there a new discount program we didn't know about?
554000	557000	No, because when he prays two,
557000	559000	he will realize the sweetness of the prayer
559000	561000	and he will evolve into what?
561000	562000	Five.
562000	565000	But if you just say five or zero,
565000	568000	because Islam is all or nothing,
568000	570000	then he's not even going to accept Islam.
570000	571000	You understand?
571000	573000	He has to go step by step.
573000	574000	That is not just the law.
574000	576000	That is also what?
576000	577000	Wisdom.
577000	579000	A'ayh, insha'Allah, the Allah says
579000	581000	that if the first thing Allah revealed
581000	583000	was don't drink alcohol,
583000	585000	laa taashrabul khamr,
585000	586000	we would have responded,
586000	588000	wallahi lannatrukan khawra abadan.
588000	591000	We swear to God, we will never leave alcohol.
592000	594000	That's what we would have responded.
594000	597000	Well, that means Allah exercised wisdom
597000	601000	in when he revealed the law when people were ready.
601000	604000	One of the most fascinating aspects of law in the Quran
604000	607000	is the law of how women should be dressed.
607000	609000	That's also a law in the Quran.
609000	612000	The Quran was revealed over 23 years.
612000	616000	Men and women were becoming Muslim from the first year.
616000	617000	Right?
617000	618000	Allah could have revealed,
618000	621000	now that you're Muslim, you should wear hijab in which year?
621000	622000	Year one.
622000	624000	Year two.
624000	631000	Nope, three, four, five, six, ten, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.
631000	633000	Now we're in Badina.
633000	636000	The battle of Badr has already happened.
636000	638000	And no laws for what?
638000	640000	No laws for hijab.
640000	642000	No laws for khimar.
642000	644000	No laws for jilbab.
644000	647000	Near, arguably, after O'had.
648000	650000	After O'had.
650000	653000	And between, you know, around the time of Surat al-A'zab,
653000	654000	the battle of A'zab,
654000	657000	that's when khimar and jilbab are revealed,
657000	660000	Surat al-Nur and Surat al-A'zab are revealed.
660000	661000	The question is,
661000	664000	these women were Muslim from the time early on,
664000	667000	from the time of Khadija, may Allah be with him, onwards.
667000	670000	There are people that are women that have accepted Islam.
670000	674000	And they are not being told to wear the khimar.
674000	677000	They're being told to sacrifice their lives and leave
677000	679000	and make hijab with the Prophet Salli Sallam,
679000	681000	which is a big ask.
681000	684000	But they're not being told to what?
684000	687000	What Allah decided when to send that.
687000	688000	He says,
693000	694000	He says,
694000	695000	We broke up the Quran.
695000	699000	We divided it up so you could read it to the people at the right time.
699000	700000	So Allah decided,
700000	704000	what's the right time to tell them about how they should dress?
704000	708000	16 years since the start of the coming of the Quran.
708000	711000	When does Allah reveal something?
711000	713000	When He gives,
713000	716000	because the word you anim is really important,
716000	719000	teaching, teaching is about a curriculum, isn't it?
719000	721000	If I'm going to teach you calculus
721000	724000	and you don't even know how to add one in one,
724000	726000	I have to start with the basics, don't I?
726000	728000	I have to start with Math 101
728000	733000	and get you to eventually take steps until you're ready for calculus.
733000	737000	Allah decides which laws are you ready for
737000	740000	and which laws you are not ready for
740000	744000	and maybe that has to do with how much Yuzaqi him has happened.
744000	747000	Yatlu alayhim ayatihi wa yuzaqiim
747000	749000	and they get to a certain point.
749000	751000	Now they're ready for this law.
751000	753000	Then there's some wunta-sqiyah.
753000	755000	Now they're ready for the next law.
755000	758000	Now they're ready for the next law, you understand?
758000	761000	And so these laws that were revealed,
761000	763000	they were revealed at a particular time.
763000	766000	Now I'm not saying that now we should follow Islam chronologically.
766000	768000	I just accepted Islam,
768000	771000	so I have about 17 years before I wear a cha'am.
771000	773000	Right?
773000	775000	Or Salah was revealed after, you know,
775000	778000	arguably after 10 years, the five prayers,
778000	780000	or at least after five years.
780000	782000	So, you know, I have another five years
782000	784000	before I start praying five times a day.
784000	786000	That's the argument that's being made.
786000	788000	The argument isn't what is and isn't the law.
788000	790000	The argument is a human being.
790000	793000	They need time to grow and to mature.
793000	795000	A human being needs time.
795000	799000	And you need to allow people time so they can mature.
799000	801000	Like if you had a younger brother
801000	804000	who was drinking and gambling and doing all that stuff,
804000	805000	and he wants to change,
805000	807000	and he says, okay, okay, okay, I'll come with you,
807000	809000	but I'm only coming to Juma.
809000	811000	And you say no.
811000	813000	Five or nothing.
813000	814000	Because in the Deenah,
814000	815000	and Allah has Islam,
815000	818000	Allah wants complete surrender.
818000	819000	You know?
819000	820000	And you enter into the Deenah,
820000	822000	in the Sunni Ka'fatan,
822000	824000	enter into the surrender of Allah completely.
824000	826000	All or nothing.
826000	827000	You lose the Juma.
827000	829000	What do you think that's going to do?
829000	830000	Huh?
830000	832000	Is he going to even show for Juma?
832000	833000	No.
833000	835000	Because you're expecting the Kitab?
835000	837000	Without what?
837000	839000	Without hikmah.
839000	840000	Without hikmah.
840000	842000	Hikmah actually means that there's, you know,
842000	843000	and we know in real life,
843000	844000	there are situations like that
844000	847000	where you can't expect someone to transform overnight.
847000	850000	Allah didn't even expect a transformation
850000	852000	from the companions overnight.
852000	854000	So there's a young lady sitting here
854000	856000	who's struggling with the hijab,
856000	857000	and we say,
857000	860000	you know, these some sisters, man,
860000	861000	they don't even,
861000	863000	astaghfirullah.
863000	865000	Bro, you don't get up for Fajr every morning,
865000	867000	which was revealed much sooner.
867000	869000	And Allah even says,
869000	871000	Quran al-Fajr,
871000	874000	the Quran al-Fajr is going to be witnessed.
874000	876000	That's what Allah says about Quran al-Fajr.
876000	879000	No astaghfirullah there.
879000	880000	Right?
880000	882000	So what I'm trying to tell you is,
882000	885000	Allah didn't just give us a set of rules.
885000	887000	The Quran is not a book of rules.
887000	888000	It's a book of transformation.
888000	890000	And transformation takes time.
890000	893000	That's why the transformation of the companions
893000	895000	was compared to the growing of a tree.
895000	897000	That was actually compared to,
897000	900000	because a seed needs water,
900000	902000	needs to be matured, needs to grow.
902000	904000	By the way, yuzikki also means to help mature
904000	905000	and to help grow.
905000	906000	And when you grow enough,
906000	908000	then you can handle certain kinds of laws.
908000	910000	So that's something we have to internalize
910000	911000	about the law.
911000	913000	It takes time for one to learn it.
913000	916000	It takes time for one to apply it.
916000	918000	And we should allow that leeway
918000	921000	for someone to learn and apply the law.
921000	923000	This also teaches us that,
923000	924000	you know, some students,
924000	925000	because the analogy,
925000	927000	the wording used by Allah is teaching.
927000	928000	The messenger teaches.
928000	931000	Some people are fast learners.
931000	933000	Some people are slow learners.
933000	934000	Is that not true?
934000	936000	Isn't that a reality of teaching?
936000	938000	Some students are older students.
938000	939000	They're senior students.
939000	941000	And some people are new students.
941000	942000	Is that not also true?
942000	946000	Can a teacher expect the same application
946000	948000	from all of his students or her students?
948000	950000	Is that ever happened?
950000	952000	That's just, that negates education.
952000	955000	Any one of you that knows anything about education knows
955000	958000	you have to identify where your student is
958000	960000	and if you really want them to develop,
960000	962000	you need to identify what's the next step for them
962000	964000	and then what's the next step for them after that
964000	965000	and you have to give
965000	967000	لتركبنا طبق عن طبق
967000	969000	You need to give them one little bit at a time.
969000	970000	This is why the Quran was revealed
970000	971000	stage by stage by stage.
971000	972000	It's not just laws.
972000	974000	It's actually development.
974000	975000	So this
975000	978000	you عن لي مهم الكتاب is mentioned after.
978000	980000	Then there's another dimension to this
980000	982000	of الحكمة
982000	984000	What I want you to know about الحكمة
984000	986000	is also something called
986000	988000	and I want you to know if you're taking notes
988000	989000	you should write this down.
989000	990000	There's something called the letter of the law
990000	992000	and the spirit of the law.
992000	993000	There's two things.
993000	994000	There's the letter of the law
994000	996000	and the spirit of the law.
996000	997000	Okay?
997000	1000000	And what that means is
1000000	1004000	that every law of the law has a purpose.
1004000	1006000	There's a reason you were given that law.
1006000	1008000	Like Allah says, you were given the law of fasting
1008000	1010000	so you could get Taqwa.
1010000	1014000	So the letter is fast from Fajr until Maghrib.
1014000	1016000	That's the letter of the law.
1016000	1018000	The technicalities.
1018000	1021000	And the spirit of the law is get Taqwa.
1021000	1023000	The letter of the law and the prayers is
1023000	1025000	here's the time for Fajr.
1025000	1026000	Here's the time for Zohar.
1026000	1027000	Here's Asr.
1027000	1028000	Here's Maghrib as-Zisha.
1028000	1030000	Here's how many rak'as you should pray.
1030000	1031000	Here's how you make Ruk'u'a.
1031000	1032000	Here's how you make Sujood.
1032000	1034000	That's all what part of the law.
1034000	1036000	The letter of the law.
1036000	1037000	But Allah says,
1037000	1038000	أقم الصلاة الذكري
1038000	1041000	establish prayer so you can truly remember me.
1041000	1043000	What's the spirit of prayer?
1043000	1044000	Rememberance of Allah.
1044000	1046000	And there are other spirits of prayer.
1046000	1049000	إنّ الصلاة تَنْهَا عَنَ الْفَعْشَاءِي وَالْمُنْكَالْ
1049000	1053000	Prayer stops you from doing evil and shameless things.
1053000	1055000	Prayer prevents you from falling into evil and shameless things.
1055000	1057000	That is the spirit of the law.
1057000	1060000	So there's always the letter and there's the spirit.
1060000	1062000	These two things are...
1062000	1065000	Now, so the outside of it is...
1065000	1068000	You can see the letter of it on the outside.
1068000	1071000	And there's a spirit of it on the inside.
1071000	1075000	Like for example, even Allah of Hijab for women has a letter.
1075000	1076000	Here's how you should wear it.
1076000	1077000	Here's what you should do.
1077000	1079000	Here's the garment you should wear.
1079000	1081000	That's in Surah Tendoura and Surah Al-Azab.
1081000	1082000	And then in those same Surahs,
1082000	1083000	Allah will not just tell us,
1083000	1084000	Okay, here's the letter.
1084000	1085000	He'll also tell us,
1085000	1087000	Here is the what?
1087000	1088000	Here's the spirit,
1088000	1089000	which if you're interested,
1089000	1090000	study Surah Tendoura.
1090000	1092000	I've done a series on Surah Tendoura on that subject.
1092000	1094000	It's pretty juicy actually.
1094000	1097000	What is the spirit of the khima?
1097000	1098000	It's not weird.
1098000	1101000	What is the letter of the prohibition of alcohol?
1101000	1104000	What is the spirit of the prohibition of alcohol?
1104000	1107000	So every law has the letter and the spirit.
1107000	1109000	One way you can think about this is,
1109000	1112000	the letter of it is al-kitab,
1112000	1116000	and the spirit of it is al-hikmah.
1116000	1119000	Al-kitab and al-hikmah.
1119000	1121000	Ash-Sha'fi'i Rahimahullah
1121000	1123000	became famous for one of his opinions,
1123000	1126000	a lot of scholars after him adopted that opinion.
1126000	1129000	They said the kitab refers to the Quran,
1129000	1131000	and al-hikmah refers to the sunnah of the Prophet,
1131000	1132000	Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.
1132000	1134000	That was his opinion,
1134000	1136000	and it became extremely popular.
1136000	1138000	Though there is a lot of merit to that opinion,
1138000	1140000	because hikmah also in Arabic means
1140000	1142000	Al-al-munnafi'u wal-amalubihi,
1142000	1144000	beneficial knowledge that you act upon.
1144000	1146000	So in that sense, the Quran is the theory,
1146000	1148000	and the sunnah is the what?
1148000	1150000	The practice of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.
1150000	1151000	So in that sense,
1151000	1153000	the theory and the practice,
1153000	1155000	Al-kitab wal-hikmah.
1155000	1157000	And of course the practice also is,
1157000	1159000	when do you apply it, when do you not apply it?
1159000	1161000	Right?
1161000	1163000	How do you apply the law of Allah?
1163000	1165000	Like a woman who comes and says,
1165000	1167000	punish me, I have committed adultery,
1167000	1169000	and the Prophet says go away.
1169000	1172000	He told her go away, don't get punished.
1172000	1173000	I don't want you to get punished,
1173000	1175000	like he sent her away.
1175000	1176000	Or some Sahabi who said,
1176000	1177000	I have a head injury,
1177000	1179000	according to the law,
1179000	1181000	I have to take a shower, I have to take a bath.
1181000	1182000	Should I take a bath?
1182000	1183000	And the people around him said,
1183000	1185000	yeah, of course you should take a bath, it's the law.
1185000	1187000	So he took a bath, and his infection got worse,
1187000	1188000	and he died.
1188000	1191000	And the Prophet was upset with them
1191000	1193000	for imposing the law on him,
1193000	1195000	because it lacked what?
1195000	1197000	It lacked, it lacked, so that's sunnah, right?
1197000	1199000	So the sunnah shows you
1199000	1201000	when to and how to apply the law, right?
1201000	1203000	So that makes a lot of sense.
1203000	1205000	But what's interesting is,
1205000	1207000	that is not the only position on the law,
1207000	1209000	or rather on wisdom.
1209000	1211000	Wisdom is used in the Quran,
1211000	1213000	like I was telling you, there's all PhD thesis on this,
1213000	1215000	but wisdom is used in the Quran
1215000	1217000	for prophets before the Messenger of Allah,
1217000	1220000	so he says, used for Ibrahim, Allah gave him wisdom.
1220000	1223000	It's used for Dawud,
1223000	1225000	that they were given wisdom.
1225000	1228000	It's also used for
1228000	1230000	Luqman, who's not a prophet,
1230000	1234000	and also Allah even says,
1234000	1236000	he gives wisdom to whoever he wants.
1236000	1238000	But in these ayaat,
1238000	1240000	what I want you to understand is something
1240000	1242000	we're going to learn from the story of Isa A.S.
1242000	1244000	Allah says about Jesus,
1244000	1246000	where you will teach him the book and the wisdom.
1246000	1248000	Same phrases here,
1248000	1250000	book and wisdom.
1250000	1252000	And then he says he'll teach him Torah and
1252000	1254000	injeel, Torah was the laws.
1254000	1256000	Torah was the laws,
1256000	1258000	and injeel was the what?
1258000	1260000	Wisdom, and actually if you study it,
1260000	1262000	careful, you'll see that
1262000	1264000	injeel was the law,
1264000	1266000	wisdom and actually if you study it,
1266000	1268000	carefully you'll find Torah was the letter of the law,
1268000	1270000	and injeel was the
1270000	1272000	spirit of the law.
1272000	1274000	Why are you following this?
1274000	1276000	What's the point of it?
1276000	1278000	So let's understand why this is really important.
1278000	1280000	What happens if people become
1280000	1282000	only concerned with the letter?
1282000	1284000	And other people only get
1284000	1286000	concerned with the what?
1286000	1288000	Spirit. And this happens in the Muslims too.
1288000	1290000	This happened before us, it happens among us.
1290000	1292000	If you're only concerned with the letter,
1292000	1294000	all you care about is the fatwa.
1294000	1296000	That's all that, is it haram or not?
1296000	1298000	Is it haram or not? Just tell me if it's haram or not.
1298000	1300000	I just need a fatwa. That's it.
1300000	1302000	You're only concerned with the ruling.
1302000	1304000	That's all that matters to you.
1304000	1306000	When that happens to you,
1306000	1308000	your religion is reduced
1308000	1310000	to just these rules without any what?
1310000	1312000	Without any spirit.
1312000	1314000	And you don't realize
1314000	1316000	that as your spirit
1316000	1318000	starts becoming dry,
1318000	1320000	and you start becoming
1320000	1322000	spiritually disconnected,
1322000	1324000	you might be following the laws
1324000	1326000	exactly,
1326000	1328000	but you might become a really terrible person
1328000	1330000	at the same time.
1330000	1332000	Even though you're following the laws exactly.
1332000	1334000	So you're praying perfectly
1334000	1336000	the way you stand, oh my god.
1336000	1338000	Oh.
1338000	1340000	On the person next to you
1340000	1342000	you can tell their hands are in the wrong place.
1342000	1344000	The rakul wasn't exactly 90 degrees,
1344000	1346000	you checked.
1346000	1348000	Their hands and such that should have been here,
1348000	1350000	technically,
1350000	1352000	perfect letter of the law.
1352000	1354000	But the purpose of the prayer was what?
1356000	1358000	Connect to Allah?
1358000	1360000	The ayat we're talking about, for example,
1360000	1362000	the ayat we're describing
1362000	1364000	how you should be forgiving towards the family.
1364000	1366000	Fa in ta'fu wa ta'sfahu wa taqfiru, fa inna Allah al-Funir.
1366000	1368000	So the guy,
1368000	1370000	phrase, and he's the letter
1370000	1372000	he's concerned with the Imam
1372000	1374000	when he said,
1374000	1376000	ta'sfahu, his s'ad wasn't s'adi enough.
1376000	1378000	And the fa was in light
1378000	1380000	and the ha was ta'sfahu wa ta'sfahu.
1380000	1382000	Ta'sfahu.
1382000	1384000	Fa inna Allah
1384000	1386000	the null he didn't do it long enough.
1388000	1390000	You know,
1390000	1392000	the tira'ah should be perfect.
1392000	1394000	And the rakul should be this way.
1394000	1396000	And the salam should be this way.
1396000	1398000	Technically, he's concerned with all of that.
1398000	1400000	And then after he's done with the prayer
1400000	1402000	he's having a nasty argument with his wife and home.
1402000	1404000	Over something small.
1404000	1406000	While the ayat that he heard in the salawar
1406000	1408000	wa in ta'fu wa ta'sfahu wa taqfiru, fa inna Allah al-Ghafuru Rahim.
1408000	1410000	If you pardon, overlook,
1410000	1412000	let it go, Allah is forgiving.
1412000	1414000	Do you understand what's missing?
1414000	1416000	The letter is all there, what's missing?
1416000	1418000	The spirit is gone.
1418000	1420000	The spirit is completely gone.
1420000	1422000	This is, and then what happens with the letter is
1422000	1424000	when you're so focused on the letter
1424000	1426000	here's the next thing that happens.
1426000	1428000	You become very concerned about certain laws
1428000	1430000	and you
1430000	1432000	you become very concerned about certain laws
1432000	1434000	and you
1434000	1436000	completely become blind to other laws.
1436000	1438000	So
1438000	1440000	Salah,
1440000	1442000	clothing, appearance,
1442000	1444000	fasting, rituals,
1444000	1446000	the meat better be halal.
1446000	1448000	Where'd you get the meat from?
1448000	1450000	Better be halal.
1450000	1452000	You better have seen the animal die in front of your eyes
1452000	1454000	before you invite me to the barbecue.
1456000	1458000	I am not eating at your house.
1458000	1460000	Super strict on
1460000	1462000	the Qita. Got it.
1462000	1464000	Great, that's the Qawab Allah.
1464000	1466000	That same person
1466000	1468000	tells, if it's a woman
1468000	1470000	she tells her
1470000	1472000	her sons
1472000	1474000	you know, for example, if a woman's divorced
1474000	1476000	she tells her kids
1476000	1478000	I don't want you talking to your dad.
1480000	1483000	What? Wait, Allah says you have to keep family ties.
1483000	1485000	Yeah, I don't care.
1485000	1487000	It's time for margaret, let's pray margaret.
1488000	1490000	When it comes to family matters
1490000	1492000	there's no law of Allah.
1492000	1494000	When it comes to prayer, exactly the law of Allah.
1494000	1497000	When it comes to halal food, exactly the law of Allah.
1497000	1500000	When it comes to backbiting, no law of Allah.
1500000	1502000	This one is this way, that one is that way.
1502000	1504000	After the Salah is done
1504000	1506000	you prayed your perfect prayer.
1506000	1508000	Ya Sheikh, I wanted to talk to you about
1508000	1510000	this brother at the masjid.
1510000	1512000	You know about him?
1512000	1514000	That's Ghiba, bro.
1515000	1517000	No, no, this is
1520000	1522000	These are the games people play
1522000	1524000	with the law of Allah.
1524000	1526000	So when Allah says, He put them together
1526000	1528000	you alimuhum alkitaba wal hikmah
1528000	1530000	what that teaches us is
1530000	1532000	the law should never be separated from the
1532000	1534000	wisdom. And then on the other extreme
1534000	1536000	some people say, oh look at these people
1536000	1538000	their beards are so worried about
1538000	1540000	how long their beard should be
1540000	1542000	and how high their pants should be
1542000	1544000	and how should the hijab and how should
1544000	1546000	the animal should be. But look at how mean
1546000	1548000	they are and how rude they are to their family
1548000	1550000	and how they cheat people
1550000	1552000	in business. They do all these other things.
1552000	1554000	So you know what?
1554000	1556000	They have law but they have no wisdom.
1556000	1558000	I'm a good person, I'm a moral person
1558000	1560000	I follow the wisdom, even if I don't
1560000	1562000	follow the law, I'm still a good person.
1562000	1564000	So some people become
1564000	1566000	all about the law, other people become
1566000	1568000	all about the wisdom
1568000	1570000	which is exactly what happened to the Jews and the Christians.
1570000	1572000	The Jews became all about the law
1572000	1574000	and the Christians became all about the
1574000	1576000	wisdom. So they don't follow any of the laws.
1576000	1578000	They got rid of the laws.
1578000	1580000	The dichotomy happened and this dichotomy
1580000	1582000	still exists among them
1582000	1584000	and it came inside the umma
1584000	1586000	and Allah sent his final prophet
1586000	1588000	sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and gave him
1588000	1590000	a revelation which never
1590000	1592000	lets him separate the law
1592000	1594000	from the wisdom in every ayah
1594000	1596000	every ayah that has law has wisdom in it too
1596000	1598000	you alimuhum alkitaba wal
1598000	1600000	haikmah
1600000	1602000	Now before our break
1602000	1604000	I want to ask you what al-malik means
1604000	1606000	which ayah is that from
1606000	1608000	first ayah
1608000	1610000	ok let me ask you
1610000	1612000	what did I say about the king?
1612000	1614000	A kingdom is recognized by what?
1614000	1616000	It's symbols, very good you remember
1616000	1618000	excellent ok al-Quddus
1618000	1620000	what does it mean?
1620000	1622000	The holy, the pure
1622000	1624000	the source of all purity
1624000	1626000	you remember that discussion?
1626000	1628000	What does it mean?
1628000	1630000	The powerful
1630000	1632000	the authority
1632000	1634000	the one who cannot be overcome
1634000	1636000	the governor? Good
1636000	1638000	Good
1638000	1640000	The ruler al-Hakeem
1640000	1642000	the wise and the wise judge
1642000	1644000	Four names of Allah yes?
1644000	1646000	Ok we're not on ayah number one
1646000	1648000	we're on ayah number two aren't we?
1648000	1650000	What's the first thing the prophet does?
1652000	1654000	He introduces them to Allah's symbols
1654000	1656000	Allah's ayat
1656000	1658000	Allah's ayat
1658000	1660000	and a king is known by
1660000	1662000	his ayat
1662000	1664000	What is the second thing the prophet does?
1664000	1666000	He purifies them
1666000	1668000	What was the second name of Allah?
1668000	1670000	The pure
1672000	1674000	What is the third thing the prophet does?
1674000	1676000	He teaches them the law
1676000	1678000	Where does the law come from?
1680000	1682000	Comes from the authority
1682000	1684000	If you don't have authority you can't have law
1684000	1686000	What's the last thing the prophet does?
1686000	1688000	He teaches them what?
1688000	1690000	Where does wisdom come from?
1690000	1692000	Al-Hakeem
1694000	1696000	You see what Allah does?
1696000	1698000	He tells them the ayat
1698000	1700000	meaning the ayat of the king
1700000	1702000	He purifies them
1702000	1704000	purifies them from the holy
1704000	1706000	and teaches them the book
1706000	1708000	the book of the dear
1708000	1710000	and teaches them the wisdom
1710000	1712000	and teaches them the wisdom
1712000	1714000	Al-Hakeem
1714000	1716000	Somebody asked me earlier today
1716000	1718000	why is it in this order?
1718000	1720000	Well
1720000	1722000	It's as if the process
1722000	1724000	of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam
1724000	1726000	is bringing to life
1726000	1728000	the sequence of the names of Allah
1728000	1730000	in people's lives
1730000	1732000	Actually the prophet's mission
1732000	1734000	is to create the reality
1734000	1736000	of the king of the holy
1736000	1738000	and when you do that
1738000	1740000	you really have to speak
1740000	1742000	You truly have to speak
1742000	1744000	Sofhanallah
1744000	1746000	This is a small
1746000	1748000	taste. What time is Maghrib prayer by the way?
1748000	1750000	Do you want to keep track?
1750000	1752000	By 20?
1752000	1754000	I want to take a little bit more time
1754000	1756000	Who is the one who sent the ummi
1756000	1758000	and the messenger from them
1758000	1760000	and teaches them the ayat
1760000	1762000	and teaches them the book
1762000	1764000	and the wisdom
1764000	1766000	Four steps
1766000	1768000	are spiritual and the next two steps
1768000	1770000	are intellectual
1770000	1772000	It's also really cool
1772000	1774000	The first two steps are
1774000	1776000	you're hearing the ayat
1776000	1778000	the ayat that are being recited cleansing
1778000	1780000	it pushes towards the spiritual
1780000	1782000	and the hearts
1782000	1784000	and the next two steps are cleansing the mind
1784000	1786000	right?
1786000	1788000	and so it's actually the hearts and the minds
1788000	1790000	all of them are covered in these phrases
1790000	1792000	But this last part
1792000	1794000	Arabic students might be
1794000	1796000	interested to know
1796000	1798000	this in is not in shartiyah
1798000	1800000	this does not mean if
1800000	1802000	it does not mean if and how do we know it doesn't mean if?
1802000	1804000	because it's a lam
1804000	1806000	in qadum in qablu lafi
1806000	1808000	when the lam is there that guarantees
1808000	1810000	that it's not an in that means if
1810000	1812000	so this actually is a short version
1812000	1814000	of innahum
1814000	1816000	innahum so the translation of in here would be
1816000	1818000	and certainly before this
1818000	1820000	for a long time before this
1820000	1822000	they were lost in obvious misguidance
1822000	1824000	meaning these Arabs
1824000	1826000	to whom the prophet came for a long time
1826000	1828000	they were a completely
1828000	1830000	utterly lost I'm going to tell you a little bit about the word lost
1830000	1832000	and after the salat
1832000	1834000	I'm going to actually explain to you
1834000	1836000	maybe I'll get started on that now
1836000	1838000	explain to you the relationship between this ayah
1838000	1840000	and Ibrahim alayhis salam
1840000	1842000	which is extremely important
1842000	1844000	we can't move from this ayah if we don't understand
1844000	1846000	its connection to Ibrahim alayhis salam
1846000	1848000	so
1848000	1850000	let's first talk about the word badaal
1850000	1852000	which commonly gets translated
1852000	1854000	misguidance we use this word also
1854000	1856000	in surat al-Fatiha
1856000	1858000	what a badaalin
1858000	1860000	a badaal is water so if you have
1860000	1862000	a large rock like a flat
1862000	1864000	surface rock and you don't even know that
1864000	1866000	water is running underneath it and there's no way
1866000	1868000	for you to access that water so that water
1868000	1870000	is there but it's no good for you because
1870000	1872000	you can't access it because of the giant rock
1872000	1874000	that kind of water is called
1874000	1876000	badaal meaning it's there
1876000	1878000	but it's lost unfortunately it cannot
1878000	1880000	be taken advantage of and the ladin
1880000	1882000	our stones found
1882000	1884000	like people wanted to use rocks for
1884000	1886000	building but sometimes the rocks were so
1886000	1888000	deep down in the bottom of the valley they're there
1888000	1890000	but they're useless because you can't bring
1890000	1892000	them out of the valley back to the village
1892000	1894000	because they're way at the bottom of the canyon
1894000	1896000	right so they are badaal because
1896000	1898000	amlas yakun fi buddun al awdiyah
1898000	1900000	similarly badaal shay when something gets
1900000	1902000	hidden or lost
1902000	1904000	and if you yourself get lost
1904000	1906000	in a sense getting lost
1906000	1908000	also becomes getting useless
1908000	1910000	right so and
1910000	1912000	that's why the word badaal is used
1912000	1914000	qalmaa phillabin
1914000	1916000	ghiyabu shayfi athna'i shayhatala
1916000	1918000	ta'a mayyuz haddam idhaak
1918000	1920000	actually also means when something
1920000	1922000	is lost in something else
1922000	1924000	like water that is in the milk
1924000	1926000	but they become inseparable that's also called
1926000	1928000	badaal
1928000	1930000	so you can't distinguish one thing from the other
1930000	1932000	they become mixed with each other so the idea
1932000	1934000	badaal mubin also means
1934000	1936000	you had mixed all kinds of things with each other
1936000	1938000	you had the Arabs
1938000	1940000	had some parts of the Jewish religion
1940000	1942000	some influence from the Christians
1942000	1944000	some influence from the religion of ibrahim
1944000	1946000	aleyhis salam some from some other pagan
1946000	1948000	societies greek societies
1948000	1950000	roman society they mixed
1950000	1952000	all these different religious traditions into
1952000	1954000	one hodgepodge religion
1954000	1956000	all of it mixed together like water
1956000	1958000	and the milk right
1958000	1960000	that's badaal also confusion
1960000	1962000	and one of the names of the Quran is
1962000	1964000	al-forqan
1964000	1966000	one of its names is al-forqan
1966000	1968000	you know what al-forqan means? separation
1968000	1970000	badaal is everything mixed together
1970000	1972000	al-forqan is separation
1972000	1974000	and by the way if you look at the wording
1974000	1976000	ayat
1976000	1978000	yatua'anim ayati wajdakihim tazkiya
1978000	1980000	actually means to purify meaning you separate
1980000	1982000	the filthy from the clean
1982000	1984000	which is literally what cleaning is purification is
1984000	1986000	is to separate those things from each other
1986000	1988000	okay so i'm going to introduce this to you
1988000	1990000	and inshallah we'll talk about this
1990000	1992000	in a little bit
1992000	1994000	i'm so excited that we can move on from
1994000	1996000	ayat number two soon
1998000	2000000	i think the rest of it should go rather
2000000	2002000	rather quickly inshallah anyway
2002000	2004000	so the first
2004000	2006000	time we hear about
2006000	2008000	this phrasing of four items
2008000	2010000	happened thousands of years
2010000	2012000	ago when ibrahim aleyhis salam built a
2012000	2014000	kaaba
2014000	2016000	when ibrahim aleyhis salam built a kaaba he spoke to
2016000	2018000	Allah and he said
2018000	2020000	he was standing with ismail
2020000	2022000	this is really important he was standing with
2022000	2024000	who ismail okay does he
2024000	2026000	is ibrahim only have ismail as a child
2026000	2028000	does he have another child
2028000	2030000	ishak will be born later
2030000	2032000	okay his haq is a little bit later
2032000	2034000	so he's standing with young ismail
2034000	2036000	they finished you know they were
2036000	2038000	he was supposed to be sacrificed
2038000	2040000	and he passes that test
2040000	2042000	and now he's taken now that they've passed that test
2042000	2044000	now Allah has assigned ibrahim aleyhis salam
2044000	2046000	to build the kaaba along with
2046000	2048000	ismail and they're building the kaaba
2048000	2050000	and when they're building the kaaba together
2050000	2052000	they make a dua together
2052000	2054000	so ibrahim and ismail make a dua together
2054000	2056000	ربّا دا وَبْعَدْ فِيهِمْ رَسُودَمْ
2056000	2058000	they make dua about their own children
2058000	2060000	so if they're children of both
2060000	2062000	ibrahim and ismail it means
2062000	2064000	from the children of ismail
2064000	2066000	this is important because later on
2066000	2068000	ibrahim will have which child
2068000	2070000	his haq this dua is not
2070000	2072000	about the children that will come from
2072000	2074000	his haq because this dua does not
2074000	2076000	combine ibrahim and his haq
2076000	2078000	this dua combines ibrahim and
2078000	2080000	ismail how do we know it combines them
2080000	2082000	it says ربّا دا
2082000	2084000	who's the hour referring to it's not my master
2084000	2086000	it's our master so who does it include
2086000	2088000	ibrahim and ismail
2088000	2090000	if you study the ayat before 129 in baqarah
2090000	2092000	you'll see why it's ismail aleyhis salam
2092000	2094000	so what prayer did they make
2094000	2096000	they said
2096000	2098000	رَسُودَمْ رَسُودَمْ
2098000	2100000	among them a messenger
2100000	2102000	raised in their midst a messenger
2102000	2104000	who comes from among them does that sound familiar to today's
2104000	2106000	this ayat
2106000	2108000	thousands of years ago these two made a dua
2108000	2110000	this barren desert where we're putting
2110000	2112000	this house together and these people
2112000	2114000	that have settled here
2114000	2116000	raised in their midst a messenger
2116000	2118000	who comes from among them
2118000	2120000	يطلُوا عليهم آياتكة
2120000	2122000	he will read your ayat to them
2122000	2124000	does that sound familiar
2124000	2126000	then they said
2126000	2127000	carefully when you
2127000	2129000	عَلِّمُهُمُ الْكِتَابَةَ
2129000	2131000	he will teach them the law
2131000	2133000	and wisdom
2133000	2135000	does that sound familiar
2135000	2137000	when you zaki him and he will purify them
2137000	2139000	does that sound familiar
2139000	2141000	okay
2141000	2143000	this is cool
2143000	2145000	انت العزيز الحكيم
2145000	2147000	you are ultimately the
2147000	2149000	العزيز الحكيم
2149000	2151000	check this out
2151000	2153000	in the ayat we're studying the next ayat is going to be
2153000	2155000	وَعَخَرِينَ منهم لَمْ لَمْ مَا يَلْحَقْنُوا بِهِمْ
2155000	2157000	وَهُوَ الْعَزيزُ وَالْحَكِيمْ
2157000	2159000	and the ayat before ended also
2159000	2161000	you said
2161000	2163000	بِحُلِ الْنَاهِمَا فِسْسَمَا وَاتِي مِمَا فِتْ أَرْضَ الْمَلِكَ الْقَدُوْسِ
2163000	2165000	العزيز الحكيم
2165000	2167000	and thousands of years ago
2167000	2169000	إِرْحِبَ الْإِسْمَعِيدْ مَيْدَ دُعَى
2169000	2171000	and in that dua what names of Allah did they call him with
2171000	2173000	العزيز الحكيم
2173000	2175000	okay
2175000	2177000	but there is a difference
2177000	2179000	did you notice a difference
2179000	2181000	the order has changed
2181000	2183000	there were four items
2183000	2185000	if you call them A, B, C and D
2185000	2187000	it seems like
2187000	2189000	A, C, D and
2189000	2191000	B
2191000	2193000	you zaki him is at the end now
2193000	2195000	it's not in the beginning
2195000	2197000	you see that
2197000	2199000	okay another ayah in the Quran
2199000	2201000	كما أرسلنا فيكم
2201000	2203000	now Allah is talking this is not
2203000	2205000	Ibrahim talking at Ismaili now Allah is
2205000	2207000	speaking directly Allah says
2207000	2209000	كما أرسلنا فيكم رسولا منكم
2209000	2211000	this is how we have sent
2211000	2213000	in your midst a messenger from among
2213000	2215000	you يطلع عليكم آياتينا
2215000	2217000	he is reciting on to you our ayat
2217000	2219000	ويزكيكم and he is purifying you
2219000	2221000	ويعلّمكم الكتابة والحكمة
2221000	2223000	and he is teaching you the law and the wisdom
2223000	2225000	ويعلّمكم ما لم تكونوا تعدمون
2225000	2227000	and he is teaching you what you couldn't have known yourselves
2227000	2229000	does that sound familiar
2229000	2231000	same order as what we studied today
2231000	2233000	يطلع عليكم آياتينا
2233000	2235000	ويزكيكم ويعلّمكم الكتاب وال
2235000	2237000	حكمة okay let's look one more place
2237000	2239000	this is the fourth time now
2239000	2241000	the first time is the one we are looking at
2241000	2243000	but this is now the fourth time
2243000	2245000	Naqadmanallahu ala al-Mu'mineen
2245000	2247000	Allah has certainly done a favor
2247000	2249000	on the believers
2249000	2251000	if ba'athaf veehim Rasoola min anfussi him
2251000	2253000	when he raised a messenger
2253000	2255000	from within themselves
2255000	2257000	in their midst
2257000	2259000	يطلع عليهم آياتيه ويزكيهم
2259000	2261000	ويعلّمكم الكتابة والحكمة
2261000	2263000	sound familiar
2263000	2265000	وإن كانوا من قبدو لفيض لعالم مبين
2265000	2267000	even though they were utterly lost before this
2267000	2269000	they were completely lost in misguidance before this
2269000	2271000	four times this ayah occurs
2271000	2278000	And three of those times Allah is speaking, one time who's speaking?
2278000	2280000	Abraham and the Spirits are speaking.
2280000	2283000	And the one time that Abraham and the Spirits are speaking is different.
2283000	2286000	And the other times are different.
2286000	2295000	And the thing is, we have to, the tasks we have in front of us after the Salaat, why are they different?
2295000	2300000	And what is the connection to this with what we're studying in the rest of the Surah also?
2300000	2305000	To what Abraham, alayhis salam, said those thousands of years ago alongside our father, Ismail alayhis salam.
2305000	2308000	So we'll stop with that and inshallah take a break for Salaat.
2308000	2311000	Mubarak Allah adi wa-dakum. Salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah.
2314000	2315000	Salamu alaykum everyone.
2315000	2320000	There are almost 50,000 students around the world that are interested on top of the students we have
2320000	2325000	in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.
2325000	2328000	And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive.
2328000	2332000	If you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our sponsorship page.
2332000	2333000	I appreciate it so much.
2333000	2339000	And pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it the world over.
