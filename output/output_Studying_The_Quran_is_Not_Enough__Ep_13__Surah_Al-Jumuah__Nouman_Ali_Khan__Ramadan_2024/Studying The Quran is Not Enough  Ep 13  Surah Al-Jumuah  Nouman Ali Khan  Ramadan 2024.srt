1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
So there's a young lady sitting here who's struggling with the hijab and we say,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,240
you know, these some sisters man, they don't even, let's talk for a while.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,600
Bro, you don't get up for fudger every morning, which was revealed much sooner.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,000
What I'm trying to tell you is, Allah didn't just give us a set of rules.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,600
The Quran is not a book of rules, it's a book of transformation.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
And transformation takes time.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's why the transformation of the companions was compared to the growing of a tree.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Peace be upon you.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayna TV.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in brief and then in great detail.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanatv.com.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also. Thank you.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Bismillah wa sallam wa sallam, wa a'la rasulillah wa a'la alihi wa sahbihi ajba'een.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
An important question that was asked that I didn't get to address is when you start studying the Quran, even for example when you're learning the Quran with me or you're listening to the Quran from somebody else or anything.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That is actually essentially an intellectual exercise.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Even if it's cleaning up your thought process, it's an intellectual cleansing.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But what about spiritual cleansing?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What about the heart feeling more connected to Allah?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's a separate thing.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You might not feel spiritually more connected just because you're listening to a bunch of lectures or learning a bunch of stuff and studying a bunch of stuff.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Those are two separate things and they're equally important actually.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The spiritual cleansing is as important as the intellectual cleansing.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So what about the spiritual cleansing?

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In my view, the Quran has described the first level of spiritual and the most powerful level of spiritual cleansing is mindful recitation of the Quran.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Not study of Tafsid and Tadabur, which is a separate thing, but a mindful recitation of the Quran is actually itself something that brings the heart calmness.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you recite the verse,

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
when the ayatah recited onto them, it increases them in iman.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
They feel something in their heart when they recite.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And you know, I could study the Quran all I want.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I tell you, even if I'm studying, like for example, I'm spending a lot of time studying surat al-Jumu'a nowadays with you guys, which is a different experience.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But when I just, at the end of the night, I just sit there and I just recite the surat.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Just recite it.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a different experience because the study and the note taking and the PowerPoint slides and all that stuff, that's up here.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Or you're just sitting and reciting to God and you're just standing in prayer and you're reciting to Allah.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's not here. Where is that?

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's here. And you do it. Maybe you do that and you don't feel anything.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Maybe you recite and you don't feel anything.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But you know what? You keep reciting and you keep reciting and you keep reciting because the recitation is like it's drilling through the layers of your heart and heart.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And eventually it'll break through.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You will feel something, but you got to stay at it.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You have to say,

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It could be that you don't feel something and that's okay.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That doesn't mean it's useless.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That means you just have more work to do, insha'Allah.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But recitation and even listening to recitation is actually a spiritual exercise.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And the bunch of people become mindful of the ayat and you listen to them.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's a very powerful exercise.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There are surahs that I've studied for years and years and years and then I hear somebody recite them and it feels like I'm hearing it for the first time.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And it's so moving for me to just hear those words.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And that's the power that Allah's words has.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So that dhikr is actually something Allah has mentioned many places in the Quran.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And just think the words that you're reciting, when you're reciting Quran,

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the words that are coming out of your mouth are words that were sent from above the seven heavens.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And there was a time when these words were being delivered by Jibril to Rasulullah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, alayhi wa sallam.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And now you get to say from your mouth the same words that were coming out of the mouth of the Prophet himself, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So it's the word of Allah, it's the word of Jibril and it's the word of even Rasulullah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, by extension.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's coming out of your mouth now.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's a very profound spiritual thing that we're doing when we're reciting the word of Allah verbatim.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, so understanding the connection between al-kitab and al-hitbah.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll talk to you a little bit about the word al-kitab.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Kitab is used in the Quran in many ways.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The word kitab is used in many ways.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So the phrase means he teaches them the book.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Literally it says it teaches them the book.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But what does the book mean?

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Any decree of Allah, like Allah decreed it should reign, or Allah decreed somebody should die.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is also Allah's Kitab.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Everything that Allah has ever decreed is in a Kitab also.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Fi Kitab-i Makhnoon, or Fi Kitab, right?

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So this is one part of the meaning of Kitab.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But there are other meanings of Kitab.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Kitab also means any particular command of Allah to His slaves.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay?

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Or any rule that Allah established.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I've written Allah, Allah, and the messenger.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Allah has declared that my messengers will win, always.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I and my messengers will always win.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now, Kitab, the meaning of Kitab that's relevant here,

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
because you know the first part said,

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
yatlu alayhim ayaatihi, which is he recites the ayat,

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
which is clearly the Quran, right?

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yatlu alayhim ayaatihi is the Quran.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And by way of the Quran, he is purifying them.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So that's also kind of a reference to the Quran,

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
along with the company of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then he teaches them the book, and of course, which book?

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The Quran.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So why is it saying three different things for the same book?

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's because we have different relationships with the book.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We need to get exposed to the book,

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
we need to develop a spiritual connection to the book.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We use a key here.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We also need to understand the book,

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the part of the book that has Allah's laws and decrees.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Actually, Kitab also means laws.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So Allah uses, for example, Kitab Allahi aleykum.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The law of Allah that's binding on you, Kitab Allah.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Qutiba aleykum al-siyam.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Qutiba aleykum al-kitan.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It says the fasting was written on you.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That doesn't mean written on you.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It actually means fasting was made law over you.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
When something is written, it actually means it's become law.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's permanent, it's actually part of the constitution.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's the Kitab.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So here, one of the meanings is he teaches them the law.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He teaches them the law.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Now, I told you there's a subtext to these surahs,

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and especially this surah.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The Israelites were listening, and the Jews particularly were people of the law.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
They believed in al-kitab.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
In fact, one of the ways they described the Torah is the laws.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's essentially laws for them.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And one of the criticisms that you find,

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the conflict between Judaism and Christianity,

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
if you study the life of Jesus,

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
is actually that they became people who only concerned themselves with the law.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They were only concerned with the law.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And there's two things I'm going to teach you today.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The letter of the law and the spirit of the law.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's where I'm going to focus our conversation.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll make it super simple.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
When a judge has a court case in front of him,

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and he's about to judge some teenager or whatever, right?

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You guys have seen those viral videos of that really nice judge in America up north?

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I was like, so what did you do?

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What did you do?

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Tell me about yourself.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're going to do that again?

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're not going to do it again, right?

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He's a nice guy.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, you'll go.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You go.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You know what I'm talking about?

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The super nice judge.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He's also, he's judging people by the law,

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
but when he looks at their situation,

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
he looks at their difficulties,

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
then he's applying what?

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wisdom.

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's actually applying wisdom.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So there's, there's law, but there's also wisdom.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And another judge could say,

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm going to throw this kid in jail

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
or I'm going to find him and I'm going to do this or that or the other.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They would still be applying the law,

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
but there would be less use of what?

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Wisdom.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What does wisdom do?

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What are the applications of wisdom is when should we apply the law

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and when should we not apply the law in the strictest sense?

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Who should we go easy on?

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Who's not ready for this yet?

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Where does it fit?

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Where does it not fit?

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So circumstantial application, you know,

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
somebody comes to the Prophet's life and asks,

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm ready to become Muslim,

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but I'm only going to pray two prayers.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How many prayers we have in a day?

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He says,

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm ready to pledge Islam.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm only going to pray two prayers.

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, the law of Islam says what?

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How many prayers?

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Five.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But the Prophet says, okay,

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I mean, take Shahada and he walks away.

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And now Sahabah are thinking,

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
is there a new discount program we didn't know about?

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, because when he prays two,

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
he will realize the sweetness of the prayer

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and he will evolve into what?

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Five.

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But if you just say five or zero,

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
because Islam is all or nothing,

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
then he's not even going to accept Islam.

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You understand?

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He has to go step by step.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That is not just the law.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That is also what?

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Wisdom.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
A'ayh, insha'Allah, the Allah says

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
that if the first thing Allah revealed

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
was don't drink alcohol,

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
laa taashrabul khamr,

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
we would have responded,

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
wallahi lannatrukan khawra abadan.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We swear to God, we will never leave alcohol.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's what we would have responded.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, that means Allah exercised wisdom

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
in when he revealed the law when people were ready.

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
One of the most fascinating aspects of law in the Quran

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
is the law of how women should be dressed.

195
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's also a law in the Quran.

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The Quran was revealed over 23 years.

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Men and women were becoming Muslim from the first year.

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Right?

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Allah could have revealed,

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
now that you're Muslim, you should wear hijab in which year?

201
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Year one.

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Year two.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Nope, three, four, five, six, ten, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Now we're in Badina.

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The battle of Badr has already happened.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And no laws for what?

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
No laws for hijab.

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No laws for khimar.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No laws for jilbab.

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Near, arguably, after O'had.

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
After O'had.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And between, you know, around the time of Surat al-A'zab,

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the battle of A'zab,

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
that's when khimar and jilbab are revealed,

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Surat al-Nur and Surat al-A'zab are revealed.

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The question is,

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
these women were Muslim from the time early on,

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
from the time of Khadija, may Allah be with him, onwards.

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
There are people that are women that have accepted Islam.

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And they are not being told to wear the khimar.

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They're being told to sacrifice their lives and leave

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and make hijab with the Prophet Salli Sallam,

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
which is a big ask.

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But they're not being told to what?

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What Allah decided when to send that.

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He says,

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He says,

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We broke up the Quran.

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We divided it up so you could read it to the people at the right time.

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So Allah decided,

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
what's the right time to tell them about how they should dress?

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
16 years since the start of the coming of the Quran.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
When does Allah reveal something?

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
When He gives,

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
because the word you anim is really important,

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
teaching, teaching is about a curriculum, isn't it?

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If I'm going to teach you calculus

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and you don't even know how to add one in one,

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have to start with the basics, don't I?

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I have to start with Math 101

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and get you to eventually take steps until you're ready for calculus.

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Allah decides which laws are you ready for

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and which laws you are not ready for

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and maybe that has to do with how much Yuzaqi him has happened.

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yatlu alayhim ayatihi wa yuzaqiim

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and they get to a certain point.

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Now they're ready for this law.

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then there's some wunta-sqiyah.

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Now they're ready for the next law.

250
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Now they're ready for the next law, you understand?

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And so these laws that were revealed,

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
they were revealed at a particular time.

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Now I'm not saying that now we should follow Islam chronologically.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I just accepted Islam,

255
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
so I have about 17 years before I wear a cha'am.

256
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Right?

257
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Or Salah was revealed after, you know,

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
arguably after 10 years, the five prayers,

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
or at least after five years.

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So, you know, I have another five years

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
before I start praying five times a day.

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's the argument that's being made.

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The argument isn't what is and isn't the law.

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The argument is a human being.

265
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They need time to grow and to mature.

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A human being needs time.

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And you need to allow people time so they can mature.

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Like if you had a younger brother

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
who was drinking and gambling and doing all that stuff,

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and he wants to change,

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and he says, okay, okay, okay, I'll come with you,

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
but I'm only coming to Juma.

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And you say no.

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Five or nothing.

275
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because in the Deenah,

276
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and Allah has Islam,

277
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Allah wants complete surrender.

278
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You know?

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And you enter into the Deenah,

280
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
in the Sunni Ka'fatan,

281
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
enter into the surrender of Allah completely.

282
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
All or nothing.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You lose the Juma.

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What do you think that's going to do?

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Huh?

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Is he going to even show for Juma?

287
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No.

288
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Because you're expecting the Kitab?

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Without what?

290
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Without hikmah.

291
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Without hikmah.

292
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Hikmah actually means that there's, you know,

293
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and we know in real life,

294
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
there are situations like that

295
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
where you can't expect someone to transform overnight.

296
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Allah didn't even expect a transformation

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
from the companions overnight.

298
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So there's a young lady sitting here

299
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
who's struggling with the hijab,

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and we say,

301
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
you know, these some sisters, man,

302
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
they don't even,

303
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
astaghfirullah.

304
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Bro, you don't get up for Fajr every morning,

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
which was revealed much sooner.

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And Allah even says,

307
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Quran al-Fajr,

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
the Quran al-Fajr is going to be witnessed.

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's what Allah says about Quran al-Fajr.

310
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No astaghfirullah there.

311
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Right?

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So what I'm trying to tell you is,

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Allah didn't just give us a set of rules.

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The Quran is not a book of rules.

315
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's a book of transformation.

316
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And transformation takes time.

317
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's why the transformation of the companions

318
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
was compared to the growing of a tree.

319
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That was actually compared to,

320
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
because a seed needs water,

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
needs to be matured, needs to grow.

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
By the way, yuzikki also means to help mature

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and to help grow.

324
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And when you grow enough,

325
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
then you can handle certain kinds of laws.

326
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So that's something we have to internalize

327
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
about the law.

328
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It takes time for one to learn it.

329
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It takes time for one to apply it.

330
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And we should allow that leeway

331
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
for someone to learn and apply the law.

332
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This also teaches us that,

333
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
you know, some students,

334
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
because the analogy,

335
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
the wording used by Allah is teaching.

336
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The messenger teaches.

337
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Some people are fast learners.

338
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Some people are slow learners.

339
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Is that not true?

340
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Isn't that a reality of teaching?

341
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Some students are older students.

342
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They're senior students.

343
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And some people are new students.

344
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Is that not also true?

345
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Can a teacher expect the same application

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
from all of his students or her students?

347
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Is that ever happened?

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's just, that negates education.

349
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Any one of you that knows anything about education knows

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
you have to identify where your student is

351
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and if you really want them to develop,

352
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you need to identify what's the next step for them

353
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and then what's the next step for them after that

354
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and you have to give

355
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
لتركبنا طبق عن طبق

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You need to give them one little bit at a time.

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This is why the Quran was revealed

358
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
stage by stage by stage.

359
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's not just laws.

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's actually development.

361
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So this

362
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you عن لي مهم الكتاب is mentioned after.

363
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then there's another dimension to this

364
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
of الحكمة

365
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What I want you to know about الحكمة

366
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
is also something called

367
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and I want you to know if you're taking notes

368
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
you should write this down.

369
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There's something called the letter of the law

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and the spirit of the law.

371
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
There's two things.

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There's the letter of the law

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and the spirit of the law.

374
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay?

375
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And what that means is

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
that every law of the law has a purpose.

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There's a reason you were given that law.

378
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Like Allah says, you were given the law of fasting

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
so you could get Taqwa.

380
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So the letter is fast from Fajr until Maghrib.

381
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's the letter of the law.

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The technicalities.

383
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And the spirit of the law is get Taqwa.

384
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The letter of the law and the prayers is

385
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
here's the time for Fajr.

386
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Here's the time for Zohar.

387
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Here's Asr.

388
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Here's Maghrib as-Zisha.

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Here's how many rak'as you should pray.

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Here's how you make Ruk'u'a.

391
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Here's how you make Sujood.

392
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's all what part of the law.

393
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The letter of the law.

394
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But Allah says,

395
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
أقم الصلاة الذكري

396
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
establish prayer so you can truly remember me.

397
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What's the spirit of prayer?

398
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Rememberance of Allah.

399
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And there are other spirits of prayer.

400
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
إنّ الصلاة تَنْهَا عَنَ الْفَعْشَاءِي وَالْمُنْكَالْ

401
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Prayer stops you from doing evil and shameless things.

402
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Prayer prevents you from falling into evil and shameless things.

403
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That is the spirit of the law.

404
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So there's always the letter and there's the spirit.

405
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
These two things are...

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Now, so the outside of it is...

407
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You can see the letter of it on the outside.

408
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And there's a spirit of it on the inside.

409
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Like for example, even Allah of Hijab for women has a letter.

410
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Here's how you should wear it.

411
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Here's what you should do.

412
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Here's the garment you should wear.

413
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's in Surah Tendoura and Surah Al-Azab.

414
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And then in those same Surahs,

415
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Allah will not just tell us,

416
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay, here's the letter.

417
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
He'll also tell us,

418
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Here is the what?

419
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Here's the spirit,

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
which if you're interested,

421
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
study Surah Tendoura.

422
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I've done a series on Surah Tendoura on that subject.

423
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's pretty juicy actually.

424
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What is the spirit of the khima?

425
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's not weird.

426
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What is the letter of the prohibition of alcohol?

427
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What is the spirit of the prohibition of alcohol?

428
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So every law has the letter and the spirit.

429
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
One way you can think about this is,

430
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
the letter of it is al-kitab,

431
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and the spirit of it is al-hikmah.

432
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Al-kitab and al-hikmah.

433
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Ash-Sha'fi'i Rahimahullah

434
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
became famous for one of his opinions,

435
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
a lot of scholars after him adopted that opinion.

436
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
They said the kitab refers to the Quran,

437
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and al-hikmah refers to the sunnah of the Prophet,

438
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.

439
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That was his opinion,

440
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and it became extremely popular.

441
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Though there is a lot of merit to that opinion,

442
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
because hikmah also in Arabic means

443
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Al-al-munnafi'u wal-amalubihi,

444
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
beneficial knowledge that you act upon.

445
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So in that sense, the Quran is the theory,

446
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and the sunnah is the what?

447
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The practice of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.

448
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So in that sense,

449
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
the theory and the practice,

450
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Al-kitab wal-hikmah.

451
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And of course the practice also is,

452
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
when do you apply it, when do you not apply it?

453
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Right?

454
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
How do you apply the law of Allah?

455
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like a woman who comes and says,

456
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
punish me, I have committed adultery,

457
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and the Prophet says go away.

458
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He told her go away, don't get punished.

459
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't want you to get punished,

460
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
like he sent her away.

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Or some Sahabi who said,

462
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I have a head injury,

463
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
according to the law,

464
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I have to take a shower, I have to take a bath.

465
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Should I take a bath?

466
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And the people around him said,

467
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
yeah, of course you should take a bath, it's the law.

468
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So he took a bath, and his infection got worse,

469
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and he died.

470
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And the Prophet was upset with them

471
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
for imposing the law on him,

472
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because it lacked what?

473
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It lacked, it lacked, so that's sunnah, right?

474
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So the sunnah shows you

475
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
when to and how to apply the law, right?

476
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So that makes a lot of sense.

477
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But what's interesting is,

478
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that is not the only position on the law,

479
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
or rather on wisdom.

480
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Wisdom is used in the Quran,

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
like I was telling you, there's all PhD thesis on this,

482
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
but wisdom is used in the Quran

483
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
for prophets before the Messenger of Allah,

484
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
so he says, used for Ibrahim, Allah gave him wisdom.

485
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's used for Dawud,

486
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
that they were given wisdom.

487
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's also used for

488
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Luqman, who's not a prophet,

489
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and also Allah even says,

490
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
he gives wisdom to whoever he wants.

491
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But in these ayaat,

492
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
what I want you to understand is something

493
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
we're going to learn from the story of Isa A.S.

494
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Allah says about Jesus,

495
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
where you will teach him the book and the wisdom.

496
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Same phrases here,

497
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
book and wisdom.

498
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And then he says he'll teach him Torah and

499
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
injeel, Torah was the laws.

500
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Torah was the laws,

501
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and injeel was the what?

502
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wisdom, and actually if you study it,

503
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
careful, you'll see that

504
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
injeel was the law,

505
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
wisdom and actually if you study it,

506
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
carefully you'll find Torah was the letter of the law,

507
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and injeel was the

508
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
spirit of the law.

509
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Why are you following this?

510
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What's the point of it?

511
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So let's understand why this is really important.

512
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What happens if people become

513
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
only concerned with the letter?

514
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And other people only get

515
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
concerned with the what?

516
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Spirit. And this happens in the Muslims too.

517
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This happened before us, it happens among us.

518
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If you're only concerned with the letter,

519
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
all you care about is the fatwa.

520
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's all that, is it haram or not?

521
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Is it haram or not? Just tell me if it's haram or not.

522
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I just need a fatwa. That's it.

523
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You're only concerned with the ruling.

524
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's all that matters to you.

525
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
When that happens to you,

526
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
your religion is reduced

527
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
to just these rules without any what?

528
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Without any spirit.

529
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And you don't realize

530
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that as your spirit

531
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
starts becoming dry,

532
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and you start becoming

533
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
spiritually disconnected,

534
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
you might be following the laws

535
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
exactly,

536
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
but you might become a really terrible person

537
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
at the same time.

538
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Even though you're following the laws exactly.

539
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So you're praying perfectly

540
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
the way you stand, oh my god.

541
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh.

542
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
On the person next to you

543
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
you can tell their hands are in the wrong place.

544
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The rakul wasn't exactly 90 degrees,

545
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
you checked.

546
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Their hands and such that should have been here,

547
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
technically,

548
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
perfect letter of the law.

549
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But the purpose of the prayer was what?

550
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Connect to Allah?

551
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The ayat we're talking about, for example,

552
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
the ayat we're describing

553
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
how you should be forgiving towards the family.

554
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Fa in ta'fu wa ta'sfahu wa taqfiru, fa inna Allah al-Funir.

555
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So the guy,

556
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
phrase, and he's the letter

557
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
he's concerned with the Imam

558
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
when he said,

559
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
ta'sfahu, his s'ad wasn't s'adi enough.

560
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And the fa was in light

561
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and the ha was ta'sfahu wa ta'sfahu.

562
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Ta'sfahu.

563
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Fa inna Allah

564
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the null he didn't do it long enough.

565
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You know,

566
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the tira'ah should be perfect.

567
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And the rakul should be this way.

568
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And the salam should be this way.

569
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Technically, he's concerned with all of that.

570
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And then after he's done with the prayer

571
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
he's having a nasty argument with his wife and home.

572
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Over something small.

573
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
While the ayat that he heard in the salawar

574
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
wa in ta'fu wa ta'sfahu wa taqfiru, fa inna Allah al-Ghafuru Rahim.

575
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If you pardon, overlook,

576
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
let it go, Allah is forgiving.

577
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Do you understand what's missing?

578
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The letter is all there, what's missing?

579
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The spirit is gone.

580
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The spirit is completely gone.

581
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
This is, and then what happens with the letter is

582
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
when you're so focused on the letter

583
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
here's the next thing that happens.

584
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You become very concerned about certain laws

585
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and you

586
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
you become very concerned about certain laws

587
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and you

588
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
completely become blind to other laws.

589
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So

590
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Salah,

591
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
clothing, appearance,

592
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
fasting, rituals,

593
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
the meat better be halal.

594
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Where'd you get the meat from?

595
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Better be halal.

596
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You better have seen the animal die in front of your eyes

597
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
before you invite me to the barbecue.

598
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I am not eating at your house.

599
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Super strict on

600
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
the Qita. Got it.

601
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Great, that's the Qawab Allah.

602
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That same person

603
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
tells, if it's a woman

604
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
she tells her

605
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
her sons

606
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
you know, for example, if a woman's divorced

607
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
she tells her kids

608
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I don't want you talking to your dad.

609
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What? Wait, Allah says you have to keep family ties.

610
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, I don't care.

611
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's time for margaret, let's pray margaret.

612
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
When it comes to family matters

613
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
there's no law of Allah.

614
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
When it comes to prayer, exactly the law of Allah.

615
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
When it comes to halal food, exactly the law of Allah.

616
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
When it comes to backbiting, no law of Allah.

617
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This one is this way, that one is that way.

618
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
After the Salah is done

619
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you prayed your perfect prayer.

620
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Ya Sheikh, I wanted to talk to you about

621
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
this brother at the masjid.

622
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You know about him?

623
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That's Ghiba, bro.

624
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
No, no, this is

625
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
These are the games people play

626
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
with the law of Allah.

627
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So when Allah says, He put them together

628
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
you alimuhum alkitaba wal hikmah

629
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
what that teaches us is

630
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
the law should never be separated from the

631
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
wisdom. And then on the other extreme

632
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
some people say, oh look at these people

633
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
their beards are so worried about

634
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
how long their beard should be

635
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
and how high their pants should be

636
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and how should the hijab and how should

637
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
the animal should be. But look at how mean

638
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
they are and how rude they are to their family

639
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and how they cheat people

640
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
in business. They do all these other things.

641
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So you know what?

642
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
They have law but they have no wisdom.

643
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm a good person, I'm a moral person

644
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I follow the wisdom, even if I don't

645
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
follow the law, I'm still a good person.

646
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So some people become

647
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
all about the law, other people become

648
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
all about the wisdom

649
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
which is exactly what happened to the Jews and the Christians.

650
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The Jews became all about the law

651
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and the Christians became all about the

652
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
wisdom. So they don't follow any of the laws.

653
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
They got rid of the laws.

654
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The dichotomy happened and this dichotomy

655
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
still exists among them

656
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and it came inside the umma

657
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and Allah sent his final prophet

658
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and gave him

659
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
a revelation which never

660
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
lets him separate the law

661
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
from the wisdom in every ayah

662
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
every ayah that has law has wisdom in it too

663
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
you alimuhum alkitaba wal

664
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
haikmah

665
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Now before our break

666
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I want to ask you what al-malik means

667
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
which ayah is that from

668
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
first ayah

669
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
ok let me ask you

670
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
what did I say about the king?

671
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
A kingdom is recognized by what?

672
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's symbols, very good you remember

673
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
excellent ok al-Quddus

674
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
what does it mean?

675
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The holy, the pure

676
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
the source of all purity

677
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
you remember that discussion?

678
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What does it mean?

679
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The powerful

680
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
the authority

681
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
the one who cannot be overcome

682
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
the governor? Good

683
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Good

684
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The ruler al-Hakeem

685
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
the wise and the wise judge

686
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Four names of Allah yes?

687
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Ok we're not on ayah number one

688
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
we're on ayah number two aren't we?

689
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What's the first thing the prophet does?

690
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
He introduces them to Allah's symbols

691
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Allah's ayat

692
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Allah's ayat

693
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and a king is known by

694
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
his ayat

695
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
What is the second thing the prophet does?

696
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He purifies them

697
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
What was the second name of Allah?

698
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
The pure

699
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
What is the third thing the prophet does?

700
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
He teaches them the law

701
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Where does the law come from?

702
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Comes from the authority

703
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
If you don't have authority you can't have law

704
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What's the last thing the prophet does?

705
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
He teaches them what?

706
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Where does wisdom come from?

707
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Al-Hakeem

708
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You see what Allah does?

709
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
He tells them the ayat

710
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
meaning the ayat of the king

711
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He purifies them

712
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
purifies them from the holy

713
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and teaches them the book

714
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
the book of the dear

715
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and teaches them the wisdom

716
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and teaches them the wisdom

717
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Al-Hakeem

718
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Somebody asked me earlier today

719
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
why is it in this order?

720
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Well

721
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's as if the process

722
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam

723
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
is bringing to life

724
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
the sequence of the names of Allah

725
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
in people's lives

726
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Actually the prophet's mission

727
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
is to create the reality

728
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
of the king of the holy

729
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and when you do that

730
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
you really have to speak

731
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You truly have to speak

732
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Sofhanallah

733
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
This is a small

734
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
taste. What time is Maghrib prayer by the way?

735
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Do you want to keep track?

736
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
By 20?

737
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I want to take a little bit more time

738
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Who is the one who sent the ummi

739
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and the messenger from them

740
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and teaches them the ayat

741
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and teaches them the book

742
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and the wisdom

743
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Four steps

744
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
are spiritual and the next two steps

745
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
are intellectual

746
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's also really cool

747
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The first two steps are

748
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
you're hearing the ayat

749
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the ayat that are being recited cleansing

750
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
it pushes towards the spiritual

751
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and the hearts

752
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and the next two steps are cleansing the mind

753
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
right?

754
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and so it's actually the hearts and the minds

755
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
all of them are covered in these phrases

756
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But this last part

757
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Arabic students might be

758
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
interested to know

759
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
this in is not in shartiyah

760
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
this does not mean if

761
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
it does not mean if and how do we know it doesn't mean if?

762
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
because it's a lam

763
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
in qadum in qablu lafi

764
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
when the lam is there that guarantees

765
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
that it's not an in that means if

766
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
so this actually is a short version

767
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
of innahum

768
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
innahum so the translation of in here would be

769
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and certainly before this

770
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
for a long time before this

771
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
they were lost in obvious misguidance

772
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
meaning these Arabs

773
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
to whom the prophet came for a long time

774
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
they were a completely

775
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
utterly lost I'm going to tell you a little bit about the word lost

776
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and after the salat

777
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm going to actually explain to you

778
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
maybe I'll get started on that now

779
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
explain to you the relationship between this ayah

780
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and Ibrahim alayhis salam

781
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
which is extremely important

782
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
we can't move from this ayah if we don't understand

783
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
its connection to Ibrahim alayhis salam

784
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
so

785
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
let's first talk about the word badaal

786
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
which commonly gets translated

787
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
misguidance we use this word also

788
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
in surat al-Fatiha

789
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
what a badaalin

790
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
a badaal is water so if you have

791
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
a large rock like a flat

792
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
surface rock and you don't even know that

793
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
water is running underneath it and there's no way

794
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
for you to access that water so that water

795
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
is there but it's no good for you because

796
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
you can't access it because of the giant rock

797
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
that kind of water is called

798
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
badaal meaning it's there

799
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
but it's lost unfortunately it cannot

800
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
be taken advantage of and the ladin

801
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
our stones found

802
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
like people wanted to use rocks for

803
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
building but sometimes the rocks were so

804
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
deep down in the bottom of the valley they're there

805
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
but they're useless because you can't bring

806
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
them out of the valley back to the village

807
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
because they're way at the bottom of the canyon

808
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
right so they are badaal because

809
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
amlas yakun fi buddun al awdiyah

810
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
similarly badaal shay when something gets

811
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
hidden or lost

812
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and if you yourself get lost

813
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
in a sense getting lost

814
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
also becomes getting useless

815
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
right so and

816
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
that's why the word badaal is used

817
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
qalmaa phillabin

818
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
ghiyabu shayfi athna'i shayhatala

819
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
ta'a mayyuz haddam idhaak

820
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
actually also means when something

821
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
is lost in something else

822
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
like water that is in the milk

823
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
but they become inseparable that's also called

824
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
badaal

825
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
so you can't distinguish one thing from the other

826
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
they become mixed with each other so the idea

827
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
badaal mubin also means

828
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
you had mixed all kinds of things with each other

829
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
you had the Arabs

830
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
had some parts of the Jewish religion

831
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
some influence from the Christians

832
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
some influence from the religion of ibrahim

833
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
aleyhis salam some from some other pagan

834
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
societies greek societies

835
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
roman society they mixed

836
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
all these different religious traditions into

837
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
one hodgepodge religion

838
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
all of it mixed together like water

839
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and the milk right

840
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that's badaal also confusion

841
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and one of the names of the Quran is

842
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
al-forqan

843
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
one of its names is al-forqan

844
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
you know what al-forqan means? separation

845
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
badaal is everything mixed together

846
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
al-forqan is separation

847
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and by the way if you look at the wording

848
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
ayat

849
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
yatua'anim ayati wajdakihim tazkiya

850
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
actually means to purify meaning you separate

851
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
the filthy from the clean

852
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
which is literally what cleaning is purification is

853
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
is to separate those things from each other

854
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
okay so i'm going to introduce this to you

855
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and inshallah we'll talk about this

856
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
in a little bit

857
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
i'm so excited that we can move on from

858
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
ayat number two soon

859
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
i think the rest of it should go rather

860
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
rather quickly inshallah anyway

861
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
so the first

862
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
time we hear about

863
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
this phrasing of four items

864
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
happened thousands of years

865
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
ago when ibrahim aleyhis salam built a

866
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
kaaba

867
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
when ibrahim aleyhis salam built a kaaba he spoke to

868
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Allah and he said

869
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
he was standing with ismail

870
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
this is really important he was standing with

871
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
who ismail okay does he

872
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
is ibrahim only have ismail as a child

873
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
does he have another child

874
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
ishak will be born later

875
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
okay his haq is a little bit later

876
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
so he's standing with young ismail

877
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
they finished you know they were

878
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
he was supposed to be sacrificed

879
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and he passes that test

880
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and now he's taken now that they've passed that test

881
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
now Allah has assigned ibrahim aleyhis salam

882
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
to build the kaaba along with

883
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
ismail and they're building the kaaba

884
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and when they're building the kaaba together

885
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
they make a dua together

886
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
so ibrahim and ismail make a dua together

887
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
ربّا دا وَبْعَدْ فِيهِمْ رَسُودَمْ

888
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
they make dua about their own children

889
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
so if they're children of both

890
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
ibrahim and ismail it means

891
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
from the children of ismail

892
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
this is important because later on

893
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
ibrahim will have which child

894
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
his haq this dua is not

895
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
about the children that will come from

896
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
his haq because this dua does not

897
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
combine ibrahim and his haq

898
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
this dua combines ibrahim and

899
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
ismail how do we know it combines them

900
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
it says ربّا دا

901
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
who's the hour referring to it's not my master

902
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
it's our master so who does it include

903
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
ibrahim and ismail

904
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
if you study the ayat before 129 in baqarah

905
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
you'll see why it's ismail aleyhis salam

906
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
so what prayer did they make

907
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
they said

908
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
رَسُودَمْ رَسُودَمْ

909
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
among them a messenger

910
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
raised in their midst a messenger

911
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
who comes from among them does that sound familiar to today's

912
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
this ayat

913
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
thousands of years ago these two made a dua

914
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
this barren desert where we're putting

915
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
this house together and these people

916
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that have settled here

917
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
raised in their midst a messenger

918
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
who comes from among them

919
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
يطلُوا عليهم آياتكة

920
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
he will read your ayat to them

921
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
does that sound familiar

922
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
then they said

923
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
carefully when you

924
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
عَلِّمُهُمُ الْكِتَابَةَ

925
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
he will teach them the law

926
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and wisdom

927
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
does that sound familiar

928
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
when you zaki him and he will purify them

929
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
does that sound familiar

930
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
okay

931
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
this is cool

932
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
انت العزيز الحكيم

933
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
you are ultimately the

934
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
العزيز الحكيم

935
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
check this out

936
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
in the ayat we're studying the next ayat is going to be

937
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
وَعَخَرِينَ منهم لَمْ لَمْ مَا يَلْحَقْنُوا بِهِمْ

938
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
وَهُوَ الْعَزيزُ وَالْحَكِيمْ

939
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and the ayat before ended also

940
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
you said

941
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
بِحُلِ الْنَاهِمَا فِسْسَمَا وَاتِي مِمَا فِتْ أَرْضَ الْمَلِكَ الْقَدُوْسِ

942
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
العزيز الحكيم

943
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
and thousands of years ago

944
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
إِرْحِبَ الْإِسْمَعِيدْ مَيْدَ دُعَى

945
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and in that dua what names of Allah did they call him with

946
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
العزيز الحكيم

947
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
okay

948
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
but there is a difference

949
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
did you notice a difference

950
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
the order has changed

951
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
there were four items

952
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
if you call them A, B, C and D

953
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
it seems like

954
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
A, C, D and

955
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
B

956
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
you zaki him is at the end now

957
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
it's not in the beginning

958
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
you see that

959
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
okay another ayah in the Quran

960
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
كما أرسلنا فيكم

961
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
now Allah is talking this is not

962
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Ibrahim talking at Ismaili now Allah is

963
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
speaking directly Allah says

964
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
كما أرسلنا فيكم رسولا منكم

965
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
this is how we have sent

966
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
in your midst a messenger from among

967
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
you يطلع عليكم آياتينا

968
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
he is reciting on to you our ayat

969
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
ويزكيكم and he is purifying you

970
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
ويعلّمكم الكتابة والحكمة

971
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and he is teaching you the law and the wisdom

972
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
ويعلّمكم ما لم تكونوا تعدمون

973
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and he is teaching you what you couldn't have known yourselves

974
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
does that sound familiar

975
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
same order as what we studied today

976
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
يطلع عليكم آياتينا

977
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
ويزكيكم ويعلّمكم الكتاب وال

978
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
حكمة okay let's look one more place

979
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
this is the fourth time now

980
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
the first time is the one we are looking at

981
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
but this is now the fourth time

982
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Naqadmanallahu ala al-Mu'mineen

983
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Allah has certainly done a favor

984
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
on the believers

985
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
if ba'athaf veehim Rasoola min anfussi him

986
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
when he raised a messenger

987
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
from within themselves

988
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
in their midst

989
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
يطلع عليهم آياتيه ويزكيهم

990
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
ويعلّمكم الكتابة والحكمة

991
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
sound familiar

992
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
وإن كانوا من قبدو لفيض لعالم مبين

993
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
even though they were utterly lost before this

994
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
they were completely lost in misguidance before this

995
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
four times this ayah occurs

996
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And three of those times Allah is speaking, one time who's speaking?

997
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Abraham and the Spirits are speaking.

998
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And the one time that Abraham and the Spirits are speaking is different.

999
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And the other times are different.

1000
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And the thing is, we have to, the tasks we have in front of us after the Salaat, why are they different?

1001
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And what is the connection to this with what we're studying in the rest of the Surah also?

1002
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
To what Abraham, alayhis salam, said those thousands of years ago alongside our father, Ismail alayhis salam.

1003
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So we'll stop with that and inshallah take a break for Salaat.

1004
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Mubarak Allah adi wa-dakum. Salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah.

1005
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Salamu alaykum everyone.

1006
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
There are almost 50,000 students around the world that are interested on top of the students we have

1007
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.

1008
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive.

1009
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
If you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our sponsorship page.

1010
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I appreciate it so much.

1011
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it the world over.
