1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What's the ultimate dhikr according to the Quran?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Quran.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Quran.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
But when he says,

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Dhikrullah, the remembrance of Allah,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Allah is not talking about the sounds of the Quran.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Allah is talking about the message of the Quran that impacts the heart.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So our connection, the more intimate we become in our connection with the Quran,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
our recitation is going to become more spiritual.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Fa'sa'au ila dhikrullah.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Actually also, I didn't mention Salat.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If I knew the al-salat, so let me come back to this.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll show you something about Salat first.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The word Salat, which we translate as prayer,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
is actually an istilah.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Istilah in Arabic means to warm your hands on a fire.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Or to borrow a fire from an exit,

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
like there's a barbecue fire and you can take your torch and you can light up your fire.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
La'allakum tas-taloon.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The word Salat is used when his family was freezing in the desert cold

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and he said, I'm going to go up to that fire

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and I'm going to see if I can find some directions

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and hopefully I can get a little bit of the fire so you can get some warmth.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
La'allakum tas-taloon.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Same word from Salat.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's used also for people being thrown into the fire of hell.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Tasliya tujahim.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Tasliya.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, inna humda salu al-naar.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Salu from the same word.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Salayasli.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And from it we get the word prayer.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What does prayer have to do with heating and fire?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Actually the idea is when you put something in the fire or when you heat something it becomes soft.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, the heat makes it soft.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's a stick and you put it in the heat, it starts bending.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Right?

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The idea of Salat, the spiritual meaning of Salat, one of its meanings is

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
that its intensity humbles you.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It softens you.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Like it softens your heart.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It softens your thoughts.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It softens your feelings.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Taqshairro binu julood al-ladinab.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Like those who believe their sins, summa talinu juloodu, their skins become soft.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Right?

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So there's a detoxing happening.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And there's a melting of you happening when you're standing in the prayer.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's incredible.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then Hassan Hassan Jabal in his dictionary, he argues, this is a little bit technical but really cool.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So I'm sharing it with you.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The word Salah has to do with Saad, Lam and Ya.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And in Arabic there are vowels.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And if Wao and Ya are vowels.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So if you get rid of the vowels, then what consonants are left?

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Saad and Lam.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So the theory in Arabic linguistics that if there's three letters and one of them is a vowel,

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
then you look at the two consonants, in this case Saad and Lam.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And any word that shares those two letters is related to that word.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So you take the common denominator which is Saad and Lam.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And the other vowel would be if you put a Wao in the beginning, Wa-Sala, which is another word in Arabic.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Which is similar to Salah because it has Saad and Lam in it.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
One has a vowel at the end.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The other has a vowel in the beginning.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's like studying algebra.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Honestly, it's really cool.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But anyway, so this word Wa-Sala, which is a Mitha'il, Mitha'il Wa-Wi, means to connect.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And so Salah also means to join, to connect.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You know, like Wa-Yakta'oona Ma'amara Allah Bihi Ayyusala.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They cut what Allah has commanded to keep joined.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When we're called to Salah, we firstly connect to Allah.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And by extension, in a very secondary way, we actually also connect to each other.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Allah says,

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What's a physical demonstration of everybody holding on to the rope of Allah together and not being divided?

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Friday prayer.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Friday prayer, everybody's together.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They're not divided.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And they're all holding on to the rope of Allah.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So there's this idea of connection.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So let me come back and just go through some of these other things.

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Then,

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The call is made that the Lam actually means for the purpose of.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The ultimate purpose is the prayer itself.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But we know that Jumu'ah is not just a prayer.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's what else?

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's the khutbah.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's the khutbah and the prayer.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And there's five prayers in a day.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Which prayer do we not pray on Friday?

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We don't pray lot.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Lot is forakas.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But the Friday prayer is what?

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Turaqas.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Our Fukhah looked at this and said,

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The reason we don't pray the four rakah of Wur is that two of them become the equal of the khutbah.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And the other two are the prayers that we pray.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Which is why the khutbah becomes a part of the prayer.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay?

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So we're compensating two rakahs of Wur with actually the khutbah.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay?

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Which is why you should take every precaution you can to come to the Friday prayer early.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You should also take every precaution you can.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's not just any speech.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a part of the salah in that sense.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So you shouldn't be talking or, you know, distracted.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Just like you wouldn't do that in the prayer.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You wouldn't in the middle of your prayer be like,

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Allah.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, let me respond.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, I'm about to go to Rukul.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I've got to go talk later.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Allah.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Wouldn't do that and you shouldn't do that also in what?

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
In the khutbah.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
In the khutbah.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And even from an early age, our children should be taught.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Khutbah is not a...

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Any other speech.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Any other speeches going on, people are talking to each other.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No problem.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But this, you shouldn't be.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now, I'll share with you my own, again, might sound controversial to you,

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
but I'm going to share my position on this with you.

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There was a...

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because this was assumed that the two rakahs of Wur are now equivalent of the khutbah,

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
which is then making it the khutbah sacred.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The khutbah has now become sacred.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Now that it's become sacred, it should be in Arabic.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So, Fatwa came that the khutbah itself should be in the Arabic language,

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
otherwise it's not really considered a khutbah.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay?

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The problem I have with that view is that, one, the Prophet, sallallahu alaihi wa sallam,

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
spoke in Arabic because he was speaking to an Arab audience.

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's number one.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The opening praises of the Prophet's Masnu and Khutbah,

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
or the fact that we praise Allah and send salawat on the Prophet's life to them.

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Sure, do that in Arabic.

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's a great sunnah of the Prophet, sallallahu alaihi wa sallam.

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But if somebody who's Arab or speaks Arabic starts talking about, you know,

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
how we should help our young men and women become more independent

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and become financially responsible so they can get married early.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But he says all of that in Arabic to a Turkish community.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And he says all of that in Arabic to a Bangladeshi community.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Did any of them hear anything about the ayat of Allah?

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They didn't.

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's actually what I'm shared with you is inspired by the ayat of the Quran.

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The Quran talks about these issues, you know, that it talks about financial independence

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and how you have to become related to marriage.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So, this is an important issue that the community needs to hear,

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
but now they can't hear because it's only being said in Arabic.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And the problem with that is Allah never said the Arabic language is sacred.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The sacred words in the Arabic language are sacred.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Quran is sacred, not Arabic.

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When I say,

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
When I say,

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
When I say,

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's not more Islamic.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was like,

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How's it going, bro?

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's just this is equal, you know what, it was a funny story in a country

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
where they don't speak Arabic,

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but Arabic is supposed to be like really the Islamic language.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,800
They had a problem in that Muslim country where people, they just go by a wall, because

165
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,480
there's no public bathrooms, right?

166
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,560
So people go by a wall and they just pee.

167
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,800
It was just disgusting.

168
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,920
And they put giant signs, please don't urinate here, please don't pee here, etc.

169
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
And nobody listens.

170
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,940
It was just disgusting, right?

171
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,380
So somebody came up with a genius idea.

172
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,240
They put it in calligraphy Arabic.

173
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Do not pee.

174
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,040
That the problem stopped.

175
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,760
Because the minds of people Arabic itself is sacred.

176
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
So.

177
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,920
Yeah, so I do believe the most known part of the Khudba, the Hamdut of Allah's

178
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Panawata and the Salawat of the Prophet's life.

179
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,080
And I think we should preserve that some of the Prophet's life.

180
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,160
And but the message of the Khudba actually should be in the language of the people.

181
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,800
And that's why it was separated from the prayer itself.

182
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,160
So it's supposed to be a message for the people.

183
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
So anyway, that's it.

184
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,480
If I do the other Salat, I mean, you know, now, many of the

185
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,800
next piece, a part of the day of Friday.

186
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,480
This is really important because the people that came before us, the Israelites who were

187
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,160
given the Torah, they were not told to pray a part of the sacred day.

188
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,760
And for them, the sacred day was called Asabt, Asabt the Sabbath.

189
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,800
And actually they were told to pray the entire day and leave all business the entire day.

190
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm going to go into detail about that later on, but I'll tell you one thing now.

191
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,000
And that is Allah has taken what used to be part of the Sharia of Musa A.S.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,840
And he reduced it and he made it lighter.

193
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,240
Now there are other things in the Sharia of Musa A.S.

194
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,080
That Allah made lighter also.

195
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,240
Like the things they added on, like for example, I told you they considered the camel impure,

196
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,120
right?

197
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,240
And Allah clarifies that no, it's not impure.

198
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,440
You can eat that in the Quran.

199
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,680
There's an Isha'arayd Surat Al-Imran.

200
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,560
Similarly they used to have days in which they would fast.

201
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,240
Allah made those days optional, but he made the fasting of Ramadan mandatory.

202
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,680
On this note, you should note a few things about our prayers and theirs.

203
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,400
Their prayers, they used to have also Rukh-u-A'an Sujood like we have.

204
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,120
They used to have Rukh-u-A'an Sujood.

205
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,840
But it seems that they used to have Sajda first and Rukh-u-Second.

206
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Okay?

207
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,760
Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.

208
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,080
Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you that I want you to

209
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,200
sign up for bayinatv.com and help other sign up, even sponsor students for bayinatv.com

210
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,120
so we can create worldwide communities of students that are studying the meanings and

211
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,880
the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran and are insha'Allah Ta'ala spreading that in their

212
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
own circles.

213
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Thanks so much.

214
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,080
And we get that Isha'ara in how Allah spoke to or the angels spoke to Mariam Salamun

215
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,960
Aliha was sudi wa rka'i ma'al raki'ain.

216
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Do Sajda and make Rukh-u-A'an.

217
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Okay?

218
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,240
So they do Sajda and they make Rukh-u-A'an.

219
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,960
But we do Rukh-u-A'an first and we do Sajda.

220
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,040
So Allah changed the format of the prayer.

221
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,800
Then they used to pray towards Jerusalem.

222
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Allah changed it towards what?

223
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,960
The Ka'bah.

224
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,200
They used to pray in the middle three days of the month.

225
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Allah changed and the day of Ashura.

226
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Allah changed the fasting to what?

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Ramadan.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,480
He mandated the fasting in?

229
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Ramadan.

230
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
So what is Allah doing?

231
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,440
He changed the capital.

232
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,480
He changed the national holiday.

233
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Right?

234
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,080
He changed the sacrifice.

235
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,600
He kept some things but he altered each thing.

236
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
You know what that is?

237
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,040
When a nation has a new capital.

238
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,760
When a nation has a new constitution, the Quran.

239
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,720
When a nation has a new, we don't have an independence day.

240
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
We have an independence month.

241
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,760
And usually a nation has an independence day when their constitution gets materialized.

242
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,480
The Quran got materialized meaning it came down in the month of Ramadan.

243
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,600
So we don't have an independence day.

244
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
We have an independence month.

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Right?

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,560
And then we celebrate that at the end with Eid, actually.

247
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Right?

248
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,200
And then daily it claimed to Ibrahim, Allah gave us Eid al-Aqha.

249
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,300
And we make bigger claim to Ibrahim, than they can ever make.

250
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,980
Because now millions and millions and millions of people go to Hajj and we have an Ibrahim

251
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,460
convention every year.

252
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
Right?

253
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,580
That's literally an Ibrahim al-Asaam convention.

254
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,660
And we slaughtered the animal just like who slaughtered the animal.

255
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,660
Ibrahim al-Asaam.

256
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,380
So we reclaimed Ibrahim al-Asaam.

257
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,980
We reclaimed the legacy of Ibrahim.

258
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
We reclaimed the prayer.

259
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
We reclaimed the fasting.

260
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,540
We reclaimed the final revelation.

261
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,020
All of it's getting reclaimed.

262
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,260
And the same way they had the day of Sabbath and Allah said, now the sacred day shall be

263
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
Jawaam.

264
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,220
That got reclaimed too.

265
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,220
There's a reclaiming happening.

266
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,220
Wait, wait, wait, what about Saturday?

267
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
No?

268
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
It's actually Friday.

269
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,620
It's Friday.

270
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,220
And it's not the whole Friday, it's only a part of Friday.

271
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,220
Allah said about them, وَيَضَعُوا عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَلَغْلَالَلَلَ

272
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,220
الْتِيْكَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ يِتَأْطُوْسُ بَتَهْبِيْبَلْ

273
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
عَلَيْهِمْ يَتَأْطُوْسُ بَتَهْبِيْبَلْ

274
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,300
Allah has given this final prophet, peace be upon him, He has given him something that removes

275
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,340
the burdens and the chains that were on them.

276
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,740
They were chained by the Sabbath and Allah has removed that and invited them to something

277
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,380
much easier, which is the day of Friday.

278
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,660
So he says to us, فَسَعُوا إِلَا ذِكْرِنْدَا

279
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:58,420
By the way, Jumu'a, the meme has an O sound, right?

280
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,980
So you have an X sound, right?

281
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,980
So you have an X sound, right?

282
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,980
So you have an X sound, right?

283
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
So you have an X sound, right?

284
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,980
So you have an X sound, right?

285
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
So you have an X sound, right?

286
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
So you have an X sound, right?

287
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
So you have an X sound, right?

288
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
So you have an X sound, right?

289
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,980
So you have an X sound, right?

290
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
So you have an X sound, right?

291
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
So you have an X sound, right?

292
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
So you have an X sound, right?

293
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,540
So before, its old name in Arabic was Aruba.

294
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
Pretty cool name too.

295
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
But Jumu'a is better.

296
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,540
Are you going to watch somebody saying, hey, you're going to go to Aruba?

297
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
I was like, no, I'm going to Bahama.

298
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,540
Anyway, فَسَعُوا إِلَا ذِكْرِنْدَا

299
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Let's talk a little bit about, by the way, just FYI.

300
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,540
So it was called Aruba.

301
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,540
ايام الأسبوع ان العرب في القديم هي أول

302
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,540
سنده was called أول.

303
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
أهوان و جبار

304
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
And it was called Aruba.

305
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,540
And Sunday was called أول.

306
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
أهوان و جبار

307
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
That was Monday.

308
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
غراد

309
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,540
And then دبار

310
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,540
And مؤيس

311
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,540
And then عروبة

312
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
And then شيار

313
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Is actually Saturday for them.

314
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
These were the names of the week in ancient times.

315
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,540
Now of course we have

316
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,540
أحدة لثنين ثلاثة

317
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,540
العربعان, كميس, and الجمعان, a sub'd.

318
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,540
But interestingly, sub'd is the same.

319
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,540
A sub'd now, which in the

320
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,540
Hebrews say شبات

321
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,540
And in English the Bible calls it

322
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,540
سابث

323
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,540
Which actually comes

324
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,540
The Arabic etymology is سبتة

325
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,540
سبتة means to cut

326
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
Like

327
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
سبتة

328
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,540
comes from سابث also.

329
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,540
He made your sleep a time that cuts you off from this life.

330
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
Whatever problems you got going on

331
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,540
they're not going on when you're sleeping.

332
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,540
Your stress, your anxiety, your this,

333
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,540
your the fights over, the arguments over,

334
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,540
the meetings over, because you're

335
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
You're not there anymore.

336
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
You're cut off, right?

337
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
So the word سبات, it was used because

338
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
it cut them off from their business,

339
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,540
their earnings, everything. It cut them off completely.

340
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,540
So Allah says

341
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,540
فَسْعَوْئِلَا ذِكْلِ اللَّهَ

342
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,540
Rush to the remembrance of Allah, or rush

343
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,540
towards remembering Allah.

344
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
Now Allah could have said

345
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
when the call is made for the prayer

346
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,540
as part of the day of Friday

347
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
rush to it

348
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,540
فَسْعَوْئِلَيْهَا

349
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Rush to it and the it

350
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
would refer to the prayer.

351
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
But Allah now gave a new name

352
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,540
to the prayer, which is what?

353
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
The remembrance of Allah

354
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
ذِكْلِ اللَّهَ

355
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
فَسْعَوْئِلَا ذِكْلِ اللَّهَ

356
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,540
This is called المُظْهَر بعد المُظْمر

357
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
We are في مقام المُظْمر

358
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,540
Meaning we expected a pronoun

359
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,540
but Allah used a noun.

360
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Let me put that in simple words for you.

361
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,540
If Allah calls to the prayer

362
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,540
go to it.

363
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
That makes simple sense right? If Allah calls to the prayer

364
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,540
go to it.

365
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
Everybody hears it, they know what it is talking about.

366
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,540
What's it talking about?

367
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,540
The prayer. But Allah says when Allah calls to the prayer

368
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,540
go to remember Allah.

369
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,540
Go to remember Allah.

370
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,540
So instead of saying the word prayer

371
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
or saying the word it, he replaced it with

372
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,540
remembering Allah, which is really

373
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
amazing for a couple of reasons.

374
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,540
The most obvious one of them is

375
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,540
is on the outside. But the remembrance of Allah is on the

376
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,540
inside. This is the Al-Kitab with Hikmah together.

377
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,540
Isn't it?

378
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,540
Because Sula'a is Kitab and

379
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Vikrullah is Hikmah

380
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
and they got fused again.

381
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,540
So you don't get to separate them from each other.

382
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,540
One is the matter of our actions and the other

383
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,540
is the matter of our hearts. We also now learn

384
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,540
what is the ultimate goal

385
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,540
of the Friday prayer is to

386
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,540
truly engage in the remembrance of Allah.

387
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
So now the concept of remembering Allah

388
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
A couple of comments about that

389
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
before i give you your break.

390
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
We are not going to be done about this quickly

391
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,540
because there is lots to discuss here

392
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,540
But I'll just tell you something about the Zikr of Allah.

393
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
When somebody says I'm doing Zikr nowadays

394
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,540
what do they think of?

395
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Spill it now, smell it fried.

396
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Spill ourselves and spread hضa orui

397
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,540
through camera splay

398
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,540
sarfazawaza ouruper

399
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,540
or

400
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Or do they have the beat

401
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
situation?

402
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:16,020
they move that be I'm impressed with the way they move the bee

403
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,920
...machines and zickers

404
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:29,340
right and now you have like people that have digital like pretty soon you're

405
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,480
gonna get the AI to do your zicker for you

406
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,080
Zikr turned into this weird thing.

407
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,480
I mean obviously you could do that stuff fine but it turned into this other institution

408
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,320
that actually started getting further and further away from what Allah was describing

409
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,120
as zikr, the remembrance of Allah.

410
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,480
The remembrance of Allah says,

411
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,560
Andadina yathkoluna allaha qiyaman wa qurootan wa a'la junubihim.

412
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,680
They remember Allah standing, sitting and on their sides.

413
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,680
The Prophet ﷺ taught us, when you walk into a home, make this dua,

414
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,480
when you walk into the bathroom, make this dua, when you start eating,

415
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
say Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

416
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,880
When you wake up, make this dua, when you go to sleep, make this dua,

417
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,480
when you're with your wife, make this dua, when you get in the car,

418
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,480
make this dua, when you reach your destination, make this dua.

419
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,880
When you hear some good news, make this dua, when there's rain, make this dua,

420
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,680
when it's hot outside, make this dua.

421
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Oh my God!

422
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,080
What is that? What is all of that?

423
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,280
That's the zikr of Allah.

424
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,080
Let's remember it. Any opportunity in life, it just becomes remembrance of Allah.

425
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,480
It's not a generic set of words.

426
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,880
Those words have value of course, Alhamdulillah, SubhanAllah, Astaghfirullah.

427
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,680
Those are heartfelt words and we're supposed to do the width of those words.

428
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,080
That has its own place.

429
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,080
But the actual zikr of Allah was in life situations.

430
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,880
And it's not supposed to be some kind of a posturing or a kind of a demonstration of your spirituality.

431
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Like when somebody walks in that you don't like and you say,

432
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,680
Astaghfirullah Al-Azim, or La Huda Wa La Quwwata Al-Labin,

433
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,480
or people sometimes say Alhamdulillah and other times they say,

434
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,680
Alhamdulillah Wa Alah Kulli Had.

435
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,880
Meaning Alhamdulillah no matter what.

436
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,680
Even though you're here.

437
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,080
You know?

438
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,080
And those are, that's not zikr.

439
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,080
That's just you trying to slap someone with religious terms.

440
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,080
That's not, let's not call that zikr.

441
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Zikr is done from the heart.

442
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,680
And zikr is done with genuinely you remember Allah and the ultimate thing,

443
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,280
the ultimate component of zikr.

444
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,080
What does the Quran say about the Quran itself?

445
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,480
He says,

446
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,080
It is nothing but zikr.

447
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,880
This is the description of what?

448
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,680
The Quran.

449
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,080
In it, no doubt there is a powerful zikr for anyone who has a heart.

450
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,480
فذكر بالقرآن من يخافوا عيد.

451
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Remind with the Quran, whoever fears my threats.

452
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,880
Remind with the Quran.

453
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,680
No, no, no.

454
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,480
It is a very powerful reminder.

455
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,680
Whoever wants can remember it.

456
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280
Remember what?

457
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
The Quran.

458
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,480
بالقرآن اذذذكر.

459
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,080
I swear by the Quran that has the power of zikr.

460
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,280
What's the ultimate zikr according to the Quran?

461
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,880
The Quran.

462
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,280
The Quran.

463
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
And but when he says,

464
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,480
The remembrance of Allah, Allah is not talking about the sounds of the Quran.

465
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,880
Allah is talking about the message of the Quran that impacts the heart.

466
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,280
So our connection, the more intimate we become in our connection with the Quran,

467
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,280
our recitation is going to become more spiritual.

468
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,280
By the way, even if you don't understand Arabic and you listen to recitation, you'll feel something.

469
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
You'll feel a connection.

470
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,280
But the more you start learning the Quran, even indirectly, little by little by little,

471
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,280
and you listen to the same recitation, it will hit you differently and then differently again and then differently again.

472
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,280
And I'm guaranteeing you, Arabic is not the key to understanding the Quran.

473
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,480
Arabic is one of many doors, many locks that have to be unlocked in the heart.

474
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,480
It's just one key, but there are many gates.

475
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,280
And those gates, the more you spend time with the Allah's Book, you will recognize those other gates.

476
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,880
They, each one of you have different gates inside of them that are locked.

477
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,480
I was in a, because I'm going to give you your break, I'll just remind you guys of one of the most amazing experiences in my life.

478
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,880
I went with Dr. Soheb to something called Dawrat al-Quran.

479
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,280
Dawrat al-Quran.

480
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
We went to Allah and Masqat.

481
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,080
And we spent a week there.

482
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,280
And what sheikh, you know, our Dawood, was non-sat-ta'a, on the first day was so amazing.

483
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,480
The whole program was in Arabic.

484
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,080
We spent an entire week living in the Masjid.

485
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,280
Nobody, like we were the only, I think we were the only two non-Arab's there, me and me and Dr. Soheb, right?

486
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,880
And of course I'm going to be like super Pakistani.

487
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,680
So I wore Shalakamiz the whole time because I'm not going to pretend to be Arab.

488
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,680
Listen, so, because I'm not, but so, but anyway, so we're there the whole week.

489
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,880
And then first, and he said,

490
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:28,080
And you know, among you are scholars, among you are Islamic court judges, among you are hadith scholars.

491
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,880
I was like, as he said, among you are taxi drivers.

492
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,880
I was like, okay, we're okay now.

493
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,080
But nobody knows who anybody is.

494
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,280
Nobody knows. He goes, and he goes,

495
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Alhamdulillah, we understand Arabic.

496
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,280
We understand the Quran when it is recited.

497
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,280
When the Quran is recited, honestly, we understand it.

498
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:57,480
Well, I can, but there are walls between us, our hearts and the Quran.

499
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,680
And the walls aren't just about knowledge because we have the knowledge, but there's still walls.

500
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:10,280
We're going to spend a week trying to break those walls between us, our hearts and the Quran.

501
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,880
And he said, we're going to do something called Qiraat-Qalb.

502
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,680
We're going to recite, there's a mind reading of the Quran.

503
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,280
There's a mindful reading of the Quran and there's a heart reading of the Quran.

504
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,680
We're going to do a heart reading of the Quran.

505
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,880
A Qalb, Qiraat-Qalb, the Quran.

506
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,280
That's what we're going to do.

507
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,880
I'm telling you, this was one of the most unreal Quran experiences of my life.

508
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,480
We would sit there and we would recite the same ayat.

509
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,680
I've heard those ayat hundreds of times.

510
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,280
But we're sitting there and Sheikh Tawtul-Sahab would recite,

511
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,480
Fadi Qul Isbaha.

512
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,680
And we would all repeat after him, Fadi Qul Isbaha.

513
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,480
Wajahadan Laila Sakana.

514
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,280
Wajahadan Laila Sakana.

515
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,080
The one who opens the, the one who makes the morning tear out from the sky.

516
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,480
And the one who made the night calm.

517
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,880
And we're sitting in the masjid, we're reciting this.

518
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,680
And you look outside and right after Fajr, the morning light is coming out.

519
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,080
And you're looking at that and you're hearing Allah say,

520
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,680
Fadi Qul Isbaha.

521
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,880
Wajahadan Laila Sakana.

522
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,880
And it's like you heard that for the first time.

523
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,880
You can read the tafsid, you can read the grammar, you can do all that.

524
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,280
But now you're not reading from your mind, you're reading from.

525
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,480
Rahfah Sa'aw Illa Adhiklinda.

526
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,880
Come to Allah's remembrance.

527
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,680
Bring your heart to the Jum'ah prayer.

528
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,780
Bring your heart to it.

529
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,680
That's its point.

530
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
Some people complain,

531
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,280
O the Khudbah, who's always talking about the same thing.

532
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,980
We need some new information.

533
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,180
Why is it always saying the same thing?

534
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,980
What is the, what is the definition of reminder?

535
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,080
Is reminder something new?

536
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,280
By definition, reminder is something that you forgot.

537
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,380
You need to be told again and then again and then again and then again.

538
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,580
So the Khudbah needs to be actually the vikr of Allah.

539
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,280
So I'm going to give you guys your break at this point in the ayah.

540
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,680
BarakAllahu Alaykum.

541
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,780
Assalamu alaikum everyone.

542
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,280
There are almost 50,000 students around the world that are interested on top of the students

543
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,480
we have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to learn that and share that

544
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,680
with family and friends.

545
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,080
And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive.

546
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,780
So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our sponsorship page.

547
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,480
I appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran

548
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
and the beauty of it the world over.
