0	3000	What's the ultimate dhikr according to the Quran?
3000	5000	The Quran.
5000	6000	The Quran.
6000	7000	But when he says,
7000	10000	Dhikrullah, the remembrance of Allah,
10000	13000	Allah is not talking about the sounds of the Quran.
13000	17000	Allah is talking about the message of the Quran that impacts the heart.
17000	22000	So our connection, the more intimate we become in our connection with the Quran,
22000	25000	our recitation is going to become more spiritual.
30000	32000	Fa'sa'au ila dhikrullah.
32000	35000	Actually also, I didn't mention Salat.
35000	38000	If I knew the al-salat, so let me come back to this.
38000	40000	I'll show you something about Salat first.
40000	42000	The word Salat, which we translate as prayer,
42000	45000	is actually an istilah.
45000	48000	Istilah in Arabic means to warm your hands on a fire.
48000	49000	Okay?
49000	52000	Or to borrow a fire from an exit,
52000	56000	like there's a barbecue fire and you can take your torch and you can light up your fire.
56000	58000	La'allakum tas-taloon.
58000	61000	The word Salat is used when his family was freezing in the desert cold
61000	63000	and he said, I'm going to go up to that fire
63000	66000	and I'm going to see if I can find some directions
66000	70000	and hopefully I can get a little bit of the fire so you can get some warmth.
70000	72000	La'allakum tas-taloon.
72000	74000	Same word from Salat.
74000	78000	It's used also for people being thrown into the fire of hell.
78000	80000	Tasliya tujahim.
80000	81000	Tasliya.
81000	83000	Oh, inna humda salu al-naar.
83000	85000	Salu from the same word.
85000	86000	Salayasli.
86000	88000	And from it we get the word prayer.
88000	91000	What does prayer have to do with heating and fire?
91000	96000	Actually the idea is when you put something in the fire or when you heat something it becomes soft.
96000	98000	Okay, the heat makes it soft.
98000	102000	It's a stick and you put it in the heat, it starts bending.
102000	103000	Right?
103000	107000	The idea of Salat, the spiritual meaning of Salat, one of its meanings is
107000	109000	that its intensity humbles you.
109000	111000	It softens you.
111000	113000	Like it softens your heart.
113000	114000	It softens your thoughts.
114000	115000	It softens your feelings.
115000	117000	Taqshairro binu julood al-ladinab.
117000	122000	Like those who believe their sins, summa talinu juloodu, their skins become soft.
122000	123000	Right?
123000	127000	So there's a detoxing happening.
127000	131000	And there's a melting of you happening when you're standing in the prayer.
131000	132000	It's incredible.
132000	138000	Then Hassan Hassan Jabal in his dictionary, he argues, this is a little bit technical but really cool.
138000	139000	So I'm sharing it with you.
139000	143000	The word Salah has to do with Saad, Lam and Ya.
143000	145000	And in Arabic there are vowels.
145000	147000	And if Wao and Ya are vowels.
147000	151000	So if you get rid of the vowels, then what consonants are left?
151000	152000	Saad and Lam.
152000	159000	So the theory in Arabic linguistics that if there's three letters and one of them is a vowel,
159000	163000	then you look at the two consonants, in this case Saad and Lam.
163000	168000	And any word that shares those two letters is related to that word.
169000	172000	So you take the common denominator which is Saad and Lam.
172000	177000	And the other vowel would be if you put a Wao in the beginning, Wa-Sala, which is another word in Arabic.
177000	180000	Which is similar to Salah because it has Saad and Lam in it.
180000	182000	One has a vowel at the end.
182000	184000	The other has a vowel in the beginning.
184000	186000	It's like studying algebra.
186000	187000	Honestly, it's really cool.
187000	193000	But anyway, so this word Wa-Sala, which is a Mitha'il, Mitha'il Wa-Wi, means to connect.
194000	198000	And so Salah also means to join, to connect.
198000	201000	You know, like Wa-Yakta'oona Ma'amara Allah Bihi Ayyusala.
201000	204000	They cut what Allah has commanded to keep joined.
204000	207000	When we're called to Salah, we firstly connect to Allah.
207000	212000	And by extension, in a very secondary way, we actually also connect to each other.
212000	213000	Allah says,
213000	225000	What's a physical demonstration of everybody holding on to the rope of Allah together and not being divided?
225000	227000	Friday prayer.
227000	229000	Friday prayer, everybody's together.
229000	230000	They're not divided.
230000	232000	And they're all holding on to the rope of Allah.
232000	234000	So there's this idea of connection.
234000	237000	So let me come back and just go through some of these other things.
237000	238000	Then,
238000	243000	The call is made that the Lam actually means for the purpose of.
243000	245000	The ultimate purpose is the prayer itself.
245000	248000	But we know that Jumu'ah is not just a prayer.
248000	249000	It's what else?
249000	251000	It's the khutbah.
251000	253000	It's the khutbah and the prayer.
253000	255000	And there's five prayers in a day.
255000	258000	Which prayer do we not pray on Friday?
258000	260000	We don't pray lot.
260000	262000	Lot is forakas.
262000	265000	But the Friday prayer is what?
265000	266000	Turaqas.
266000	268000	Our Fukhah looked at this and said,
268000	273000	The reason we don't pray the four rakah of Wur is that two of them become the equal of the khutbah.
273000	276000	And the other two are the prayers that we pray.
276000	279000	Which is why the khutbah becomes a part of the prayer.
279000	280000	Okay?
280000	285000	So we're compensating two rakahs of Wur with actually the khutbah.
285000	286000	Okay?
286000	290000	Which is why you should take every precaution you can to come to the Friday prayer early.
290000	292000	You should also take every precaution you can.
292000	294000	It's not just any speech.
294000	296000	It's a part of the salah in that sense.
296000	300000	So you shouldn't be talking or, you know, distracted.
300000	302000	Just like you wouldn't do that in the prayer.
302000	304000	You wouldn't in the middle of your prayer be like,
304000	306000	Allah.
306000	308000	Well, let me respond.
308000	310000	Okay, I'm about to go to Rukul.
310000	312000	I've got to go talk later.
312000	313000	Allah.
313000	316000	Wouldn't do that and you shouldn't do that also in what?
316000	318000	In the khutbah.
318000	319000	In the khutbah.
319000	321000	And even from an early age, our children should be taught.
321000	322000	Khutbah is not a...
322000	324000	Any other speech.
324000	327000	Any other speeches going on, people are talking to each other.
327000	328000	No problem.
328000	330000	But this, you shouldn't be.
330000	334000	Now, I'll share with you my own, again, might sound controversial to you,
334000	336000	but I'm going to share my position on this with you.
336000	338000	There was a...
338000	344000	Because this was assumed that the two rakahs of Wur are now equivalent of the khutbah,
344000	347000	which is then making it the khutbah sacred.
347000	349000	The khutbah has now become sacred.
349000	354000	Now that it's become sacred, it should be in Arabic.
354000	359000	So, Fatwa came that the khutbah itself should be in the Arabic language,
359000	361000	otherwise it's not really considered a khutbah.
361000	362000	Okay?
362000	367000	The problem I have with that view is that, one, the Prophet, sallallahu alaihi wa sallam,
367000	371000	spoke in Arabic because he was speaking to an Arab audience.
371000	372000	It's number one.
372000	375000	The opening praises of the Prophet's Masnu and Khutbah,
375000	379000	or the fact that we praise Allah and send salawat on the Prophet's life to them.
379000	380000	Sure, do that in Arabic.
380000	383000	That's a great sunnah of the Prophet, sallallahu alaihi wa sallam.
383000	389000	But if somebody who's Arab or speaks Arabic starts talking about, you know,
389000	394000	how we should help our young men and women become more independent
394000	399000	and become financially responsible so they can get married early.
399000	403000	But he says all of that in Arabic to a Turkish community.
403000	406000	And he says all of that in Arabic to a Bangladeshi community.
406000	409000	Did any of them hear anything about the ayat of Allah?
409000	410000	They didn't.
410000	415000	That's actually what I'm shared with you is inspired by the ayat of the Quran.
415000	420000	The Quran talks about these issues, you know, that it talks about financial independence
420000	423000	and how you have to become related to marriage.
423000	426000	So, this is an important issue that the community needs to hear,
426000	429000	but now they can't hear because it's only being said in Arabic.
429000	434000	And the problem with that is Allah never said the Arabic language is sacred.
434000	439000	The sacred words in the Arabic language are sacred.
439000	442000	Quran is sacred, not Arabic.
442000	443000	When I say,
443000	444000	When I say,
444000	445000	When I say,
445000	446000	That's not more Islamic.
446000	447000	I was like,
447000	448000	How's it going, bro?
448000	453000	That's just this is equal, you know what, it was a funny story in a country
453000	454000	where they don't speak Arabic,
454000	457000	but Arabic is supposed to be like really the Islamic language.
457000	461800	They had a problem in that Muslim country where people, they just go by a wall, because
461800	463480	there's no public bathrooms, right?
463480	465560	So people go by a wall and they just pee.
465560	467800	It was just disgusting.
467800	471920	And they put giant signs, please don't urinate here, please don't pee here, etc.
471920	472920	And nobody listens.
472920	474940	It was just disgusting, right?
474940	477380	So somebody came up with a genius idea.
477380	480240	They put it in calligraphy Arabic.
480240	481240	Do not pee.
481880	484040	That the problem stopped.
487640	491760	Because the minds of people Arabic itself is sacred.
492160	493160	So.
497240	501920	Yeah, so I do believe the most known part of the Khudba, the Hamdut of Allah's
501920	503720	Panawata and the Salawat of the Prophet's life.
503720	506080	And I think we should preserve that some of the Prophet's life.
506080	510160	And but the message of the Khudba actually should be in the language of the people.
511160	516800	And that's why it was separated from the prayer itself.
516800	520160	So it's supposed to be a message for the people.
520160	521160	So anyway, that's it.
521160	525480	If I do the other Salat, I mean, you know, now, many of the
525480	528800	next piece, a part of the day of Friday.
528800	532480	This is really important because the people that came before us, the Israelites who were
532480	537160	given the Torah, they were not told to pray a part of the sacred day.
537160	541760	And for them, the sacred day was called Asabt, Asabt the Sabbath.
541760	547800	And actually they were told to pray the entire day and leave all business the entire day.
547800	551120	I'm going to go into detail about that later on, but I'll tell you one thing now.
551120	558000	And that is Allah has taken what used to be part of the Sharia of Musa A.S.
558000	561840	And he reduced it and he made it lighter.
561840	565240	Now there are other things in the Sharia of Musa A.S.
565240	567080	That Allah made lighter also.
567080	572240	Like the things they added on, like for example, I told you they considered the camel impure,
572240	574120	right?
574120	576240	And Allah clarifies that no, it's not impure.
576240	578440	You can eat that in the Quran.
578440	581680	There's an Isha'arayd Surat Al-Imran.
581680	584560	Similarly they used to have days in which they would fast.
584560	590240	Allah made those days optional, but he made the fasting of Ramadan mandatory.
590240	594680	On this note, you should note a few things about our prayers and theirs.
594680	599400	Their prayers, they used to have also Rukh-u-A'an Sujood like we have.
599400	601120	They used to have Rukh-u-A'an Sujood.
601120	604840	But it seems that they used to have Sajda first and Rukh-u-Second.
604840	605840	Okay?
605840	609760	Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.
609760	613080	Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you that I want you to
613080	618200	sign up for bayinatv.com and help other sign up, even sponsor students for bayinatv.com
618200	622120	so we can create worldwide communities of students that are studying the meanings and
622120	625880	the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran and are insha'Allah Ta'ala spreading that in their
625880	626880	own circles.
626880	627880	Thanks so much.
627880	633080	And we get that Isha'ara in how Allah spoke to or the angels spoke to Mariam Salamun
633080	635960	Aliha was sudi wa rka'i ma'al raki'ain.
635960	637760	Do Sajda and make Rukh-u-A'an.
637760	638760	Okay?
638760	640240	So they do Sajda and they make Rukh-u-A'an.
640240	642960	But we do Rukh-u-A'an first and we do Sajda.
642960	646040	So Allah changed the format of the prayer.
646040	648800	Then they used to pray towards Jerusalem.
648800	650800	Allah changed it towards what?
650800	651960	The Ka'bah.
651960	656200	They used to pray in the middle three days of the month.
656200	659200	Allah changed and the day of Ashura.
659200	662000	Allah changed the fasting to what?
662000	663000	Ramadan.
663000	664480	He mandated the fasting in?
664480	665480	Ramadan.
665480	666480	So what is Allah doing?
666480	668440	He changed the capital.
668440	670480	He changed the national holiday.
670480	671480	Right?
671480	674080	He changed the sacrifice.
674080	676600	He kept some things but he altered each thing.
676600	677600	You know what that is?
677600	680040	When a nation has a new capital.
680040	682760	When a nation has a new constitution, the Quran.
682760	684720	When a nation has a new, we don't have an independence day.
684720	686720	We have an independence month.
686720	691760	And usually a nation has an independence day when their constitution gets materialized.
691760	695480	The Quran got materialized meaning it came down in the month of Ramadan.
695480	696600	So we don't have an independence day.
696600	698000	We have an independence month.
698000	699000	Right?
699000	701560	And then we celebrate that at the end with Eid, actually.
701560	702560	Right?
702560	706200	And then daily it claimed to Ibrahim, Allah gave us Eid al-Aqha.
706200	709300	And we make bigger claim to Ibrahim, than they can ever make.
709300	712980	Because now millions and millions and millions of people go to Hajj and we have an Ibrahim
712980	714460	convention every year.
714460	715460	Right?
715460	717580	That's literally an Ibrahim al-Asaam convention.
717580	720660	And we slaughtered the animal just like who slaughtered the animal.
720660	721660	Ibrahim al-Asaam.
721660	724380	So we reclaimed Ibrahim al-Asaam.
724380	725980	We reclaimed the legacy of Ibrahim.
725980	726980	We reclaimed the prayer.
726980	727980	We reclaimed the fasting.
727980	729540	We reclaimed the final revelation.
729540	731020	All of it's getting reclaimed.
731020	735260	And the same way they had the day of Sabbath and Allah said, now the sacred day shall be
735260	736260	Jawaam.
736260	739220	That got reclaimed too.
739220	740220	There's a reclaiming happening.
740220	742220	Wait, wait, wait, what about Saturday?
742220	743220	No?
743220	744220	It's actually Friday.
744220	746620	It's Friday.
746620	749220	And it's not the whole Friday, it's only a part of Friday.
749220	752220	Allah said about them, وَيَضَعُوا عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَلَغْلَالَلَلَ
752220	754220	الْتِيْكَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ يِتَأْطُوْسُ بَتَهْبِيْبَلْ
754220	755220	عَلَيْهِمْ يَتَأْطُوْسُ بَتَهْبِيْبَلْ
755220	759300	Allah has given this final prophet, peace be upon him, He has given him something that removes
759300	762340	the burdens and the chains that were on them.
762340	766740	They were chained by the Sabbath and Allah has removed that and invited them to something
766740	769380	much easier, which is the day of Friday.
769380	771660	So he says to us, فَسَعُوا إِلَا ذِكْرِنْدَا
771660	778420	By the way, Jumu'a, the meme has an O sound, right?
778420	782980	So you have an X sound, right?
782980	784980	So you have an X sound, right?
784980	786980	So you have an X sound, right?
786980	788980	So you have an X sound, right?
788980	790980	So you have an X sound, right?
790980	792980	So you have an X sound, right?
792980	794980	So you have an X sound, right?
794980	796980	So you have an X sound, right?
796980	798980	So you have an X sound, right?
798980	800980	So you have an X sound, right?
800980	802980	So you have an X sound, right?
802980	804980	So you have an X sound, right?
804980	806980	So you have an X sound, right?
807540	811540	So before, its old name in Arabic was Aruba.
811540	813540	Pretty cool name too.
813540	815540	But Jumu'a is better.
815540	817540	Are you going to watch somebody saying, hey, you're going to go to Aruba?
817540	819540	I was like, no, I'm going to Bahama.
819540	821540	Anyway, فَسَعُوا إِلَا ذِكْرِنْدَا
821540	823540	Let's talk a little bit about, by the way, just FYI.
823540	825540	So it was called Aruba.
825540	827540	ايام الأسبوع ان العرب في القديم هي أول
827540	829540	سنده was called أول.
829540	831540	أهوان و جبار
831540	833540	And it was called Aruba.
833540	835540	And Sunday was called أول.
835540	837540	أهوان و جبار
837540	839540	That was Monday.
839540	841540	غراد
841540	843540	And then دبار
843540	845540	And مؤيس
845540	847540	And then عروبة
847540	849540	And then شيار
849540	851540	Is actually Saturday for them.
851540	853540	These were the names of the week in ancient times.
853540	855540	Now of course we have
855540	857540	أحدة لثنين ثلاثة
857540	859540	العربعان, كميس, and الجمعان, a sub'd.
859540	861540	But interestingly, sub'd is the same.
861540	863540	A sub'd now, which in the
863540	865540	Hebrews say شبات
865540	867540	And in English the Bible calls it
867540	869540	سابث
869540	871540	Which actually comes
871540	873540	The Arabic etymology is سبتة
873540	875540	سبتة means to cut
875540	877540	Like
877540	879540	سبتة
879540	881540	comes from سابث also.
881540	883540	He made your sleep a time that cuts you off from this life.
883540	885540	Whatever problems you got going on
885540	887540	they're not going on when you're sleeping.
887540	889540	Your stress, your anxiety, your this,
889540	891540	your the fights over, the arguments over,
891540	893540	the meetings over, because you're
893540	895540	You're not there anymore.
895540	897540	You're cut off, right?
897540	899540	So the word سبات, it was used because
899540	901540	it cut them off from their business,
901540	903540	their earnings, everything. It cut them off completely.
903540	905540	So Allah says
905540	907540	فَسْعَوْئِلَا ذِكْلِ اللَّهَ
907540	909540	Rush to the remembrance of Allah, or rush
909540	911540	towards remembering Allah.
911540	913540	Now Allah could have said
913540	915540	when the call is made for the prayer
915540	917540	as part of the day of Friday
917540	919540	rush to it
919540	921540	فَسْعَوْئِلَيْهَا
921540	923540	Rush to it and the it
923540	925540	would refer to the prayer.
925540	927540	But Allah now gave a new name
927540	929540	to the prayer, which is what?
929540	931540	The remembrance of Allah
931540	933540	ذِكْلِ اللَّهَ
933540	935540	فَسْعَوْئِلَا ذِكْلِ اللَّهَ
935540	937540	This is called المُظْهَر بعد المُظْمر
937540	939540	We are في مقام المُظْمر
939540	941540	Meaning we expected a pronoun
941540	943540	but Allah used a noun.
943540	945540	Let me put that in simple words for you.
945540	947540	If Allah calls to the prayer
947540	949540	go to it.
949540	951540	That makes simple sense right? If Allah calls to the prayer
951540	953540	go to it.
953540	955540	Everybody hears it, they know what it is talking about.
955540	957540	What's it talking about?
957540	959540	The prayer. But Allah says when Allah calls to the prayer
959540	961540	go to remember Allah.
961540	963540	Go to remember Allah.
963540	965540	So instead of saying the word prayer
965540	967540	or saying the word it, he replaced it with
967540	969540	remembering Allah, which is really
969540	971540	amazing for a couple of reasons.
971540	973540	The most obvious one of them is
973540	976540	is on the outside. But the remembrance of Allah is on the
976540	979540	inside. This is the Al-Kitab with Hikmah together.
979540	981540	Isn't it?
981540	983540	Because Sula'a is Kitab and
983540	985540	Vikrullah is Hikmah
985540	987540	and they got fused again.
987540	989540	So you don't get to separate them from each other.
989540	991540	One is the matter of our actions and the other
991540	993540	is the matter of our hearts. We also now learn
993540	995540	what is the ultimate goal
995540	997540	of the Friday prayer is to
997540	999540	truly engage in the remembrance of Allah.
999540	1001540	So now the concept of remembering Allah
1001540	1003540	A couple of comments about that
1003540	1005540	before i give you your break.
1005540	1007540	We are not going to be done about this quickly
1007540	1009540	because there is lots to discuss here
1009540	1011540	But I'll just tell you something about the Zikr of Allah.
1011540	1013540	When somebody says I'm doing Zikr nowadays
1013540	1015540	what do they think of?
1015540	1017540	Spill it now, smell it fried.
1017540	1019540	Spill ourselves and spread hضa orui
1019540	1021540	through camera splay
1021540	1023540	sarfazawaza ouruper
1023540	1024540	or
1025540	1027540	Or do they have the beat
1027540	1029540	situation?
1029540	1036020	they move that be I'm impressed with the way they move the bee
1036280	1037920	...machines and zickers
1037920	1049340	right and now you have like people that have digital like pretty soon you're
1049340	1055480	gonna get the AI to do your zicker for you
1055480	1060080	Zikr turned into this weird thing.
1060080	1064480	I mean obviously you could do that stuff fine but it turned into this other institution
1064480	1069320	that actually started getting further and further away from what Allah was describing
1069320	1073120	as zikr, the remembrance of Allah.
1073120	1074480	The remembrance of Allah says,
1074480	1078560	Andadina yathkoluna allaha qiyaman wa qurootan wa a'la junubihim.
1078560	1081680	They remember Allah standing, sitting and on their sides.
1081680	1085680	The Prophet ﷺ taught us, when you walk into a home, make this dua,
1085680	1088480	when you walk into the bathroom, make this dua, when you start eating,
1088480	1090080	say Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.
1090080	1093880	When you wake up, make this dua, when you go to sleep, make this dua,
1093880	1096480	when you're with your wife, make this dua, when you get in the car,
1096480	1099480	make this dua, when you reach your destination, make this dua.
1099480	1102880	When you hear some good news, make this dua, when there's rain, make this dua,
1102880	1104680	when it's hot outside, make this dua.
1104680	1106680	Oh my God!
1106680	1109080	What is that? What is all of that?
1109080	1111280	That's the zikr of Allah.
1111280	1115080	Let's remember it. Any opportunity in life, it just becomes remembrance of Allah.
1115080	1118480	It's not a generic set of words.
1118480	1122880	Those words have value of course, Alhamdulillah, SubhanAllah, Astaghfirullah.
1122880	1126680	Those are heartfelt words and we're supposed to do the width of those words.
1126680	1128080	That has its own place.
1128080	1132080	But the actual zikr of Allah was in life situations.
1132080	1139880	And it's not supposed to be some kind of a posturing or a kind of a demonstration of your spirituality.
1139880	1142880	Like when somebody walks in that you don't like and you say,
1142880	1147680	Astaghfirullah Al-Azim, or La Huda Wa La Quwwata Al-Labin,
1147680	1151480	or people sometimes say Alhamdulillah and other times they say,
1151480	1154680	Alhamdulillah Wa Alah Kulli Had.
1154680	1157880	Meaning Alhamdulillah no matter what.
1157880	1161680	Even though you're here.
1161680	1163080	You know?
1163080	1166080	And those are, that's not zikr.
1166080	1170080	That's just you trying to slap someone with religious terms.
1170080	1173080	That's not, let's not call that zikr.
1173080	1175080	Zikr is done from the heart.
1175080	1179680	And zikr is done with genuinely you remember Allah and the ultimate thing,
1179680	1181280	the ultimate component of zikr.
1181280	1184080	What does the Quran say about the Quran itself?
1184080	1184480	He says,
1186480	1189080	It is nothing but zikr.
1189080	1190880	This is the description of what?
1190880	1192680	The Quran.
1196480	1202080	In it, no doubt there is a powerful zikr for anyone who has a heart.
1202080	1205480	فذكر بالقرآن من يخافوا عيد.
1205480	1209480	Remind with the Quran, whoever fears my threats.
1209480	1210880	Remind with the Quran.
1214880	1215680	No, no, no.
1215680	1218480	It is a very powerful reminder.
1218480	1220680	Whoever wants can remember it.
1220680	1222280	Remember what?
1222280	1224280	The Quran.
1224280	1226480	بالقرآن اذذذكر.
1226480	1231080	I swear by the Quran that has the power of zikr.
1231080	1234280	What's the ultimate zikr according to the Quran?
1234280	1235880	The Quran.
1235880	1237280	The Quran.
1237280	1238280	And but when he says,
1239680	1244480	The remembrance of Allah, Allah is not talking about the sounds of the Quran.
1244480	1248880	Allah is talking about the message of the Quran that impacts the heart.
1248880	1253280	So our connection, the more intimate we become in our connection with the Quran,
1253280	1256280	our recitation is going to become more spiritual.
1256280	1261280	By the way, even if you don't understand Arabic and you listen to recitation, you'll feel something.
1261280	1262880	You'll feel a connection.
1262880	1267280	But the more you start learning the Quran, even indirectly, little by little by little,
1267280	1273280	and you listen to the same recitation, it will hit you differently and then differently again and then differently again.
1273280	1277280	And I'm guaranteeing you, Arabic is not the key to understanding the Quran.
1277280	1281480	Arabic is one of many doors, many locks that have to be unlocked in the heart.
1281480	1284480	It's just one key, but there are many gates.
1284480	1289280	And those gates, the more you spend time with the Allah's Book, you will recognize those other gates.
1289280	1292880	They, each one of you have different gates inside of them that are locked.
1292880	1298480	I was in a, because I'm going to give you your break, I'll just remind you guys of one of the most amazing experiences in my life.
1298480	1301880	I went with Dr. Soheb to something called Dawrat al-Quran.
1301880	1303280	Dawrat al-Quran.
1303280	1305280	We went to Allah and Masqat.
1305280	1307080	And we spent a week there.
1307080	1312280	And what sheikh, you know, our Dawood, was non-sat-ta'a, on the first day was so amazing.
1312280	1313480	The whole program was in Arabic.
1313480	1316080	We spent an entire week living in the Masjid.
1316080	1322280	Nobody, like we were the only, I think we were the only two non-Arab's there, me and me and Dr. Soheb, right?
1322280	1323880	And of course I'm going to be like super Pakistani.
1323880	1327680	So I wore Shalakamiz the whole time because I'm not going to pretend to be Arab.
1327680	1332680	Listen, so, because I'm not, but so, but anyway, so we're there the whole week.
1332680	1334880	And then first, and he said,
1334880	1348080	And you know, among you are scholars, among you are Islamic court judges, among you are hadith scholars.
1348080	1351880	I was like, as he said, among you are taxi drivers.
1351880	1356880	I was like, okay, we're okay now.
1356880	1359080	But nobody knows who anybody is.
1359080	1361280	Nobody knows. He goes, and he goes,
1361280	1364280	Alhamdulillah, we understand Arabic.
1364280	1367280	We understand the Quran when it is recited.
1367280	1370280	When the Quran is recited, honestly, we understand it.
1370280	1377480	Well, I can, but there are walls between us, our hearts and the Quran.
1377480	1382680	And the walls aren't just about knowledge because we have the knowledge, but there's still walls.
1382680	1390280	We're going to spend a week trying to break those walls between us, our hearts and the Quran.
1390280	1392880	And he said, we're going to do something called Qiraat-Qalb.
1392880	1396680	We're going to recite, there's a mind reading of the Quran.
1396680	1400280	There's a mindful reading of the Quran and there's a heart reading of the Quran.
1400280	1402680	We're going to do a heart reading of the Quran.
1402680	1405880	A Qalb, Qiraat-Qalb, the Quran.
1405880	1407280	That's what we're going to do.
1407280	1414880	I'm telling you, this was one of the most unreal Quran experiences of my life.
1414880	1417480	We would sit there and we would recite the same ayat.
1417480	1419680	I've heard those ayat hundreds of times.
1419680	1422280	But we're sitting there and Sheikh Tawtul-Sahab would recite,
1422280	1424480	Fadi Qul Isbaha.
1424480	1427680	And we would all repeat after him, Fadi Qul Isbaha.
1427680	1429480	Wajahadan Laila Sakana.
1429480	1431280	Wajahadan Laila Sakana.
1431280	1437080	The one who opens the, the one who makes the morning tear out from the sky.
1437080	1439480	And the one who made the night calm.
1439480	1441880	And we're sitting in the masjid, we're reciting this.
1441880	1445680	And you look outside and right after Fajr, the morning light is coming out.
1445680	1448080	And you're looking at that and you're hearing Allah say,
1448080	1449680	Fadi Qul Isbaha.
1449680	1451880	Wajahadan Laila Sakana.
1451880	1454880	And it's like you heard that for the first time.
1454880	1458880	You can read the tafsid, you can read the grammar, you can do all that.
1458880	1462280	But now you're not reading from your mind, you're reading from.
1462280	1464480	Rahfah Sa'aw Illa Adhiklinda.
1464480	1465880	Come to Allah's remembrance.
1465880	1469680	Bring your heart to the Jum'ah prayer.
1469680	1470780	Bring your heart to it.
1470780	1471680	That's its point.
1471680	1472880	Some people complain,
1472880	1475280	O the Khudbah, who's always talking about the same thing.
1475280	1477980	We need some new information.
1477980	1479180	Why is it always saying the same thing?
1479180	1481980	What is the, what is the definition of reminder?
1481980	1484080	Is reminder something new?
1484080	1488280	By definition, reminder is something that you forgot.
1488280	1493380	You need to be told again and then again and then again and then again.
1493380	1496580	So the Khudbah needs to be actually the vikr of Allah.
1496580	1499280	So I'm going to give you guys your break at this point in the ayah.
1499280	1501680	BarakAllahu Alaykum.
1501680	1502780	Assalamu alaikum everyone.
1502780	1507280	There are almost 50,000 students around the world that are interested on top of the students
1507280	1511480	we have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to learn that and share that
1511480	1512680	with family and friends.
1512680	1515080	And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive.
1515080	1519780	So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our sponsorship page.
1519780	1524480	I appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran
1524480	1526480	and the beauty of it the world over.
