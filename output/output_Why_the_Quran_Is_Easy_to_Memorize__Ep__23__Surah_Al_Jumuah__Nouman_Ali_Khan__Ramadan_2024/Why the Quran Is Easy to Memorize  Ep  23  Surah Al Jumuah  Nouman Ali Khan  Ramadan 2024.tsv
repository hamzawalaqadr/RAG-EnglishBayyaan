0	5520	This coming to Jumu'ah is us trying to strengthen our what?
6240	7760	Our light.
8080	9720	To reinforce our light.
9720	15560	Now, when you stand in prayer every day, five times a day, you recharge your light a little bit.
16040	16840	Okay?
16840	23280	So in cars, you need refueling every day, but every little longer, you need an oil change.
23280	25560	And a little bit longer, you need to tune up.
26160	27160	Isn't it?
31000	32800	Salamu alaikum.
32800	38760	Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayna TV.
38760	44920	I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in brief and then in great detail.
44920	48080	And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanatv.com.
48080	55640	And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also.
55640	56160	Thank you.
60000	62000	Salamu alaikum.
90160	93200	Once again, everybody, salamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi ta'ala wa l-akato.
94040	96400	We're going to start studying ayah number nine today.
96400	105480	And the first task is to try and understand the change of subject and the placement of this new final subject matter of surah al-Jumu'ah.
105480	108560	As you already know, surah al-Jumu'ah is only 11 ayat.
108560	117440	We're going to try to cover ayahs number nine and 10 today and conclude with ayah number 11 and an overview of the surah and some additional things inshallah, ta'ala, tomorrow.
117880	125560	The thing that I want you to understand is, you know, there are multiple ways to understand what is happening inside of a surah.
125560	130640	The surah of the Quran is not like a chapter in a book.
130640	137520	So I don't like the translation surah one, surah two, surah three as chapter one, chapter two, chapter three like that.
137520	143560	Because chapters, by definition, have a certain logic that everybody's familiar with.
143680	148920	Chapter three means you've or it's built on the ideas presented in chapter two, right?
148920	151240	And it depends on them in some way.
151240	158440	And if chapter three is going to need something that is going to be mentioned again from chapter two, it won't mention the whole thing again.
158440	162160	It'll just make a quick reference and then move forward, right?
162160	168920	So that's, by definition, chapters are chronological and they have a certain developmental order.
169000	174840	So you cannot start a book and go to chapter 85 if you haven't read the first 84 chapters.
174840	176480	It doesn't make any sense.
176480	179360	But in the Quran, you know that we, even kids know,
179360	185760	qulwallahu ahad, allahu samad at the end of the Quran or inna aqtainakil qawthar at the end of the Quran.
185760	193360	And even though those are the final chapters in the order of the Quran, they're not dependent on earlier material, right?
193360	196560	So it doesn't really fit the definition of chapter.
196600	199920	Surahs have their own unique identity.
199920	202120	The other thing is inside a chapter.
202120	204240	That's just the chronology of chapters.
204240	210840	But even inside a chapter, you're supposed to have a progression of ideas.
210840	216800	So you're supposed to have, you know, some kind of one subject that one chapter deals with, right?
216800	222400	And then you don't have, if you wanted to have multiple topics, then you would turn them into multiple chapters.
222400	224000	That's what you would do.
224040	229880	What happens often in the Quran is you will have one surah, but the surah might have 20 topics.
229880	231040	It might have 15 topics.
231040	232880	It might have eight different topics.
232880	234440	It doesn't feel like a chapter.
234440	237720	It almost feels like a book by itself.
237720	240760	Even it feels on its own like an entire book.
240760	248120	And even then understanding why are these different topics, why are they all together in this?
248120	251480	In this way, why is this being called a surah?
251520	253320	So I'm not using the word chapter anymore.
253320	254920	I'm using the word surah.
254920	257480	So the surah has its own logic.
257480	263880	It's not the same as the logic you find in books and chapters and poetry and other kinds of literature.
263880	266120	It's its own unique standard.
266120	276560	And one of the mistakes we make in studying the Quran is one we say, well, because you're used to reading books in literature, in poetry,
276600	283120	stories, novels, science books, mathematics books, physics books, whatever books you're reading and whatever subject you're reading,
283120	286040	they have a certain structure in a certain order.
286040	291080	We have our minds are built and programmed to process information that way.
291080	295120	And we bring those expectations to the Quran.
295120	298760	And then the Quran does not meet those expectations, clearly.
298760	302760	And then it starts feeling like the Quran is unorganized.
302800	306200	That it's because it doesn't follow the logic that we're used to.
306200	308400	It looks like it's unorganized.
308400	311160	And two things happened in our history.
311160	316880	One thing that happened in our history is our scholars, they started accepting that idea.
316880	323920	They started, many of them accepted the idea that the Quran is actually not really logically organized.
323920	327560	There's no point in exploring why is it organized this way.
327560	331640	Let's just study each ayah as a lesson from Allah.
331720	335560	And the next ayah as a next lesson from Allah and the next ayah as the next lesson from Allah.
335560	340800	And sometimes we can see that this ayah is connected to this ayah and we can describe the connection.
340800	342480	Sometimes we cannot see the connection.
342480	344360	It seems like it's completely disconnected.
344360	348960	And there you'll find that many scholars won't even discuss what just happened.
348960	351480	They'll just say, now Allah is talking about this.
351480	355120	But not say, why is he talking about this?
355120	356640	I wonder why what happened here?
356640	358720	Why did the subject change all of a second?
358720	367400	Even as an English reader of the translation of the Quran, you might notice a very abrupt, shocking change in subject.
367400	368840	Immediately without warning.
368840	369720	And you can feel it.
369720	372320	You can feel something just shifted.
372320	376960	And it's actually meant to almost disturb the reader.
376960	382040	Because the flow, like when you're listening to recitation of the Quran, it has a flow.
382040	385400	It's just called, especially a good reciter.
385400	388080	They're reciting the Quran and there's this endless continuous flow.
388120	390040	You just want them to keep on reciting.
390040	390800	Right?
390800	394600	But then when you're reading the translation, you're like, this is very cut up.
394600	395800	This is very disjointed.
395800	399160	So it actually doesn't seem like it has a flow.
399160	410560	Now, one way to understand the way things are organized in the Quran, I showed you some of the slides on the end of a section and how things are very uniquely organized inside of a chapter.
410560	410840	Right?
410840	416960	And that's not easy to hear because it's not going the order of A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
417040	420600	It's going A, B, C, and then A, B, C again.
421400	429720	Or it's going A, B, C, and then C, B, A, or something like that, which is more complicated than just A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
429720	431360	It's not the same kind of structure.
432080	438680	But at the same time as that is there, and that's, you know, whatever surahs I've worked on, I've seen those kinds of structures in all of those surahs.
438960	445240	And I've tried to explain that kind of a design to the surahs of the Quran.
445240	450120	Many people have been working on this and they've done some amazing, amazing work, especially in the last 30, 40 years.
450400	454120	Quite a bit of work has been done on the structural analysis of the Quran.
454120	456000	I think it's very fascinating, interesting work.
457120	460000	Some of this was done in classical times by scholars, very little.
460400	465400	But now it's become an entire, you can think of it, it's become an entire department in Quran studies by itself.
466560	469800	But then there's another part to the logic of surahs.
469800	472720	And that is, I like to call it linear coherence.
473040	481000	Linear coherence means, when I start my speech, between the start of my speech and the end of my speech, there needs to be a logical continuity.
481840	486880	Like A needs to make sense to move into B and B needs to make sense to move into C.
487200	489720	So you can see the conclusion of my argument, right?
490160	493760	Sometimes you listen to a speech and the speaker is talking about everything.
494360	495800	And everything was really cool.
495880	497960	But at the end of the speech, you're like, so what did he talk about?
498200	499400	I don't know, but it was awesome.
500400	504040	You don't remember because it wasn't methodically structured.
504040	505120	It wasn't organized.
505520	512360	You know, but a lecture in a class, like when you go to your professor at school, a good teacher is going to have a plan.
512680	514840	Here's how I'm going to introduce the subject.
515400	516880	Then I'm going to give examples.
517120	518280	Then I'm going to do review.
518440	521720	And then I'll conclude by recapping the entire lesson.
522360	524080	But they'll have a plan in their head.
524440	528520	A, B, C, D, and then come back to A and finish it all up, right?
528840	529480	They have a lesson.
529480	530480	It's called a lesson plan.
531040	536360	Now, Allah says, you know, I'll have a Quran and we saw here, you are the book.
536360	541160	He teaches them the book and teaching needs curriculum.
542240	544000	Speaking does not need curriculum.
544040	546160	When you're speaking to a friend, you don't need a plan.
546160	546840	You just talk.
547680	552600	But when you're teaching someone, you have a teacher does not think about what's on their mind.
553200	558000	A teacher thinks about how do I get this into the mind of my student that it stays there?
559080	566000	Okay, which is different from informing someone like the news on the radio or the news online.
566440	567760	The news is not teaching you.
567800	569800	The news is just informing you.
570080	571640	So it's a lot of information.
571880	574480	It's not expecting you to remember that information.
574760	578600	You can grab bits and pieces that you find interesting and you can move on.
579000	581880	Maybe 95%, 99% of it, you don't care.
582160	584320	The news is telling you there's traffic over there.
584320	585520	There's an accident over there.
585520	586280	There's this over there.
586440	589520	But there's one road that they mentioned that that's the one you're taking.
589640	590760	That's all you care about.
591880	596880	You know, all that information, it disappears from your mind because the news report is
596880	599480	informing you, but it's not teaching you.
600120	605320	But when a teacher teaches you, then the teacher expects that you should be able to remember
605320	608560	and reuse all the things that were taught to you.
609360	610000	You understand.
610000	615360	So there's a deeper relationship because in all of them, someone's talking and you're listening.
615360	617240	A teacher is talking and you're listening.
617440	619240	A speaker is talking and you're listening.
619440	621400	The radio is talking and you're listening.
622000	625160	All of them are just you're getting taking data inside.
625480	626960	Information is going inside.
627160	630960	But there's a fundamental difference the moment we use the word teaching.
631560	635520	Now, for teaching, a plan is really important.
636120	637040	That's the next part.
637640	639680	Teaching does not happen without a real plan.
639680	644640	A teacher has a strategy that by the end of this lesson, I have some goals.
644640	646320	I want my students to walk away with.
647120	648800	Now, what are the goals of the Quran?
649160	655680	The goals of the Quran is one of them is that you make an effort to remember.
655880	659360	So Allah wants to put things in a way that will make it easy for you to remember.
659560	664800	And of course, one of the reasons the Quran is so miraculously easy to memorize
665200	669960	is actually because part of the design of the Quran was these lessons should be forever
669960	674520	remembered and you shouldn't have to go and open a copy of a book and then
674560	675760	access these lessons.
675960	678800	They should just flow out of you on your drive home.
679000	683040	You're just reciting a surah that you memorize it and you're just reciting it.
683520	683840	Right.
684080	687520	And for thousands of years, Muslims have been memorizing parts of the Quran or
687520	690320	the entire Quran, those lessons become a part of them.
690880	694920	So we made the Quran easy for remembrance.
694920	697960	By the way, making something easy is the job of a teacher, isn't it?
699000	699240	Right.
699240	701840	Because a speaker doesn't have to make something easy.
702520	703960	A king doesn't have to make something easy.
703960	707640	But a teacher has to make something easy, unless speaking in the role of a teacher.
708040	713320	The other thing that a teacher does, that's the difference between a good teacher
713320	717480	and a bad teacher, a good teacher or let's start with a bad teacher, a bad teacher.
717480	719280	Like we have many of those in the world.
719560	723360	They'll come and sit in the class and say to the kids, read chapter three.
724720	725960	And then they're doing their own thing.
727280	728680	Like just learn it yourself.
729520	731920	All the exams on chapter five study.
733040	733920	Are you going to review it?
733960	735440	Are you going to help us understand it?
735440	737880	Are you going to know the book tells you everything you need to know?
739080	744640	In other words, their idea is so long as you have the information, you deal with it.
745360	749600	But what happens to you growing up or even in university, you're reading the text,
749640	755400	you're reading the chapter, you're reading all the information, but it's just isolated
755400	759160	bits of data, but you don't see how it makes sense.
760080	761760	It's not, it's not making sense to you.
761800	762720	It's disconnected.
763200	767360	Then you go to someone who's a better student or someone who's a tutor or someone who's
767360	770520	a, you know, doing internship or whatever you say, can you help me understand this?
770680	774040	And in five minutes, they take this complicated chapter and what do they do?
774560	775040	They help you.
775080	777000	You know, this idea, this is connected to this.
777000	781400	And then you say, you're sitting there in the library going, Oh, it's like that.
782200	783160	Oh my God.
783920	785120	Why didn't they just do that?
785120	786120	Why didn't they just say that?
786240	787520	Why do they make it so hard?
788040	790360	Many of you have had those moments in your life.
791000	794600	And then you, some of you, sometimes you've had a teacher in your life who's really good
794600	796880	at taking complicated subjects and making them, what?
797680	798600	Making them easy.
799000	799320	Right.
799320	800840	So what does Allah do?
800880	804520	Allah actually teaches in a way that makes things easy.
805720	809600	And so the Quran, somebody mentioned yesterday, the sister from Italy, from the
809600	815760	place of bad pizzas mentioned yesterday that, you know, the Quran is simply in her
815760	820080	own words, she said that the Quran is not presenting something in complicated language.
820400	822320	It's presenting it in very simplified language.
822640	823520	And that's actually true.
823760	828280	Allah, the one who knows more than any PhD knows and has more vocabulary than any
828280	831520	human being can ever have, can use the hardest words possible.
832320	837120	And if Allah wants to talk to me about Jewish history, he will, he has no more
837120	841040	knowledge of Jewish history than the Encyclopedia Britannica or the entire volumes
841040	841680	of Jewish history.
841680	843760	And he knows the chapters of history that have been lost.
844120	844840	He knows all of it.
845120	847320	He knows the map of the world better than anybody else.
848160	848400	Right.
848400	852120	He knows, he knows the places that are ruins that are buried deep inside the ground
852120	853360	and we haven't even found them yet.
853800	854960	The nations that have been lost.
855040	855680	He knows them.
855680	856360	We don't know them.
856760	860600	He could talk about them in much more sophisticated, complicated ways.
861480	865520	But he chose not to give us information in the Quran.
865840	867600	He chose to educate us.
868600	871720	And the goal, the first goal of education is to remember.
872280	876200	And the second goal of education, it seems to be in the Quran, is to change
876200	877040	the way you think.
878440	882040	Now, so Allah is less concerned with the volume of information.
883080	886240	Allah is more concerned with the way you and I think.
887040	891400	Actually, so this is really, really cool and really important.
891760	895040	That means we are, we can be obsessed with knowledge.
895040	896040	I want to learn Arabic.
896040	897920	I want to learn to see that we'll learn Hadith.
897920	900080	I want to learn fit that we'll learn Islamic history.
900320	901520	I want to learn philosophy.
901520	905000	I want to learn comparative religion, learn, learn, learn information, information,
905040	906080	information, information, information.
906520	910720	But actually, at the end of every little lesson, every single thing you learn in
910720	913720	the end, how did this change the way I what?
914760	915520	How I think.
916040	917640	How did this change the way I think?
918440	920840	My worldview has to enhance in some way.
921200	926440	With that in mind, I want you to know that every surah of the Quran has a certain
926440	931000	point. It wants you to get, it wants to get a certain way of thinking across to you.
931800	935120	This surah that we're studying, we're starting the final section of the surah.
935560	937600	It's made up of three sections.
938360	939400	There are three sections.
939800	945880	In the first section, Allah described how, what his plan is for that he gave to
945880	949960	his Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, to make sure that the final
949960	954560	prophet gives people the book and they have a relationship with the people.
954560	958480	Have a relationship with their book that is made up of four components.
959440	962320	It's not one relationship, it's four relationships.
962680	967600	Yatlu'a'adahim a'ati, wa yuzakkihim, wa yu'alimu mulkitab, wa l-hikmah.
967600	971680	And then the ummah will grow, but these four elements of the relationship will
971680	974120	remain forever. They must remain in place.
975160	979960	That was the agenda of the first section of the surah.
980560	983640	This is what a real relationship with the book looks like.
983800	984120	Okay.
984720	987960	The second section looked like it went somewhere else completely.
988160	989680	Where did we go?
990160	991560	We went into Jewish history.
992200	996080	We went into people that were given the Torah and they didn't carry it the way
996080	996960	they were supposed to.
997480	1000920	Actually, it's kind of like the way you would translate that is they carried it
1000920	1002080	without carrying it.
1002560	1007320	Because if I didn't describe this to you at the time, Allah says the example of
1007320	1011560	those who were given the burden of the Torah, then they didn't carry it.
1011960	1014680	By the end of that sentence, did they carry it or did they not carry?
1015680	1016600	They did not carry.
1016840	1020000	But the example is not of a donkey that does not carry.
1021000	1024480	The example is of a donkey that does carry.
1024760	1029120	So Allah is saying it looks like he's carrying, but he's not really carrying.
1030160	1031840	He's carrying without carrying.
1033120	1033800	You understand?
1034200	1037000	So the lesson being taught was it may...
1037040	1039400	Here's an example of people that were given a book.
1039400	1040880	Now you've been given the Quran.
1041200	1042920	People before you were not given Quran.
1042920	1046040	They were given their own Quran, which was called Torah.
1046840	1050280	And they were supposed to follow a four step process.
1051280	1054240	But when they didn't follow that process, they still had the book.
1054680	1057800	They were still carrying it, but not really carrying it.
1058480	1062880	So now that second section was actually there to give us a case study.
1063120	1066480	What happens when people stop carrying the book the right way?
1067640	1071040	And then we were told, these people, when you don't carry the book the right
1071040	1072520	way, some problems happen.
1072760	1076000	One problem that happens is you start thinking just because we have the book.
1077160	1079880	Allah must really love us more than he loves anybody else.
1080320	1083720	So no matter how bad we are in the end, we're still going to go to Jannah anyway.
1084720	1085080	Right?
1085240	1086760	And they developed that mentality.
1087000	1090600	And if we become distant from the book, we will develop that mentality.
1091240	1095800	The second thing that happened with them is they became really scared of death.
1096760	1097960	Like death was not a...
1098120	1101320	They didn't have to love death, but there was something that terrifies them.
1102120	1107160	When you accept the worldview of the Quran, then the first thing you realize is
1107160	1110640	Allah, one of the first things Allah wants you to know is that you are at this
1110640	1112040	timeline, you're in this place.
1112280	1116280	Where did this story begin with Adam, and where is the story going to end?
1116280	1118240	It's going to end on judgment day in Jannah and Nahr.
1118360	1118720	Right?
1118840	1119840	And you're on the midpoint.
1120480	1124240	And what the Quran does is it makes you realize your life didn't start when you
1124240	1125240	came out of your mom.
1125480	1127800	Your life started at the time of Adam.
1128560	1129680	So your life is pretty long.
1129680	1131080	It's been going on for a long time.
1131600	1135000	And you're in an episode right now, and there are next episodes coming.
1135200	1138400	And now that you know where you came from, you have a better idea where you're
1138920	1139520	going.
1139720	1142280	So it changes your perspective about life and death.
1143120	1145520	It changes the perspective of who you actually are.
1145880	1147120	Where did your life begin?
1147160	1148120	What's your identity?
1148800	1150720	You know, what's your relationship with reality?
1150840	1151520	It changes.
1151720	1155960	And because that changes the way you look at history changes and also the way you
1155960	1157480	look at the future changes.
1157640	1161280	And then you no longer, you're no longer terrified of the concept of death.
1161600	1162680	You're not running from it.
1162800	1164680	You're not trying to stay alive forever.
1165120	1168640	You're not doing that anymore because you know there's a meeting coming.
1168680	1173640	This your existence started with a meeting with Allah and your existence at the end
1173640	1176120	of it is also, it also has a meeting with Allah.
1176800	1179960	So where you began is where you're going to end up.
1180000	1185160	This is why we say when a person dies in Nalilahi wa inna ilayhi l-ajirun,
1185400	1190400	we are, we belong to Allah also means we started with Allah and we're going back
1190400	1191160	to where we started.
1191800	1196560	Kama badaakum ta'udun da Quran says the way he started you, you're going to come back.
1197440	1197840	Okay.
1198400	1199560	So he's, you know,
1199880	1201000	Thumma n'u'iduhu,
1201000	1205360	On n'u'iduhu al-Khalq, we will bring the creation back to where the whole thing started.
1206040	1211600	This perspective now doesn't make me feel like I am terrified of death.
1211600	1214720	It's just one chapter among many chapters that are coming.
1214720	1218520	There was many chapters before and there are chapters coming after, right?
1219240	1221480	Now, so this is what happened with that.
1221520	1223600	Now the final section of the Surah.
1225000	1231640	It is now telling us if you don't want to fall into the same mistakes that were
1231640	1236360	described in section two, I'm going to give you a solution, this Udmah.
1236360	1241400	I'm going to give you a solution that every time your relationship with your book and
1241400	1243960	with this revelation is getting rusty.
1244480	1249560	Every few days later, you will come together and you will restore your
1249560	1254560	relationship with the Quran and with Allah and you will be reminded of a
1254560	1257160	gathering that is coming, which is judgment day.
1257400	1259800	By the way, this is Surah number 62.
1260080	1265600	In Surah number 64, Allah will call judgment day, Yawmul Jam'a, the day of
1265640	1267800	gathering, Yawmul Jam'a.
1268080	1271800	And this day, the Friday prayer is Yawmul Jumu'a.
1271960	1276280	The purpose of Yawmul Jumu'a is to remind me at the end of every week of
1276280	1278000	Yawmul Jam'a.
1278880	1279280	Okay.
1279600	1281560	And in Yawmul Jumu'a, what do believers do?
1281560	1286920	They willingly come forward in the presence of the reminder, the word of Allah.
1287200	1288120	What is judgment day?
1288320	1291160	Humanity will come forward and Allah will speak to them.
1292280	1294000	Allah will speak, isn't it?
1294920	1300160	And now the people who came towards Allah willingly are going to be given
1300200	1302120	light on judgment day.
1302120	1305320	Now let's complete this imagery, the way the imagery is being designed in these
1305320	1305800	Surahs.
1306120	1311000	The first Surah of the series of these Surahs was Surah number 57, Surat Al-Hadeed.
1311800	1314840	And in Surat Al-Hadeed, Allah said a couple of really cool things.
1315360	1317680	One of them related to Surat Al-Jumu'a is,
1317680	1320880	When Lathiyyu nazilu aada abdihi ayatin bayinatin,
1321160	1324760	liyukhrijakum min al-zulumati ilan nurah, I referenced this yesterday.
1325080	1329440	He is the one who sends down on his slave, meaning Muhammad, Sadat-ul-Aqqali,
1329960	1334880	he sends down on his slave clear ayat, clear miraculous signs from Allah,
1335400	1336200	meaning the Quran.
1336520	1341040	He sends Quran on Muhammad, Salat-ul-Aqqali, liyukhrijakum min al-zulumati ilan
1341040	1346240	nurah, so he can pull you out of multiple shades of darkness into light.
1347080	1349960	He can pull you out of darknesses towards light.
1350080	1350360	Okay.
1350360	1354720	So now the imagery is, if you're coming closer to Allah, you're walking away from
1354720	1356960	darkness and you're walking towards light.
1357000	1361000	Now, this is 62 in the Surah-ul-Aqqali, what does Allah say?
1361160	1366160	يطلع عليهما ياته ويزكهه ويعلمه ملكتابة والحكمة وإنكاله
1366160	1367640	من قبله لفيضل المبين.
1367800	1368880	Let me put this in other words.
1369120	1373560	He goes through this four step process with you because he's getting you out of
1373560	1375400	darknesses into light.
1375400	1376520	This is how he does it.
1377200	1382160	This is, so that's what was introduced in Surah number 57 is now being explained
1382480	1383600	in Surah number 62.
1384080	1386480	And here Allah says, and they were utterly lost.
1386480	1388560	يكادوا من قبله لفيضل المبين.
1388760	1389760	They were utterly lost.
1389760	1393760	Imagine the imagery of Musa A.S. when he was lost in the desert with his family.
1394000	1395520	What was it that gave him guidance?
1395720	1397280	He in a distance, he saw what?
1397960	1399560	He saw light, right?
1400080	1401880	So we're in the darkness.
1402360	1403160	We're in Zadam.
1403160	1404000	We're in Zadal.
1404000	1407280	And then Allah gave light so that we have direction.
1407280	1408120	We have guidance.
1408400	1410560	Now, let's go back to Surah number 57.
1410800	1414880	Allah says, judgment day will come and believers will wake up on judgment day and
1414880	1418080	they're going to have يصعى نورهم بين ايديهم وبي ايمانهم.
1418280	1421600	They will have light coming from in front of them and from their right sides.
1422400	1423720	They'll have light coming out of them.
1424720	1431240	And this light, the one that's coming from us, from ourselves and from our right,
1431440	1435240	is actually been described as the light of Imam, the light of faith from our chest
1435520	1440160	and the light of our good deeds by our right hand, which is pretty cool.
1440400	1445240	Because يطلع عليهم آياته ويزكيهم is here.
1446400	1450080	And ويعلمهم الكتابة والحكمة is here.
1450840	1451240	Isn't it?
1452040	1455080	And that's the light that we're going to need on judgment day.
1455480	1458200	Now that light in this life, we have to preserve it.
1459400	1462360	Okay, Allah says, يجعلكم نورا تمشون به.
1462400	1463520	اتي انه سرط الحديد.
1463520	1466680	He says, He will put a light for you that you can walk in.
1467600	1469520	He'll provide a light for you that you can walk in.
1470200	1475120	Now the whole and then سرط التغابون, later on, the same surah that
1475120	1480560	calls judgment day يوم الجمع says, فَاَامِنُوا بِلَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَنُوْدِ الَّذِيَ انْزَلْنَا
1480760	1485360	Believe in Allah, believe in His Messenger and believe in the light that we set down.
1486000	1489880	So now what is the light in سرط التغابون?
1490480	1491160	The Quran.
1491360	1493640	So there's a light on judgment day that I need to walk.
1494560	1497520	The Prophet is pulling people out of darkness into light.
1497680	1501960	And the Quran now itself is being described as light.
1502720	1505320	And so this light can become weak.
1506400	1507920	In human beings, it can become weak.
1507920	1514320	So with it, Allah do he created multiple institutions to re to re trigger the light.
1514720	1518480	Five times of prayer, the five prayers.
1518840	1522840	Allah describes the analogy of the person praying before Allah in
1523200	1528040	the surah of light, the passage of light.
1528400	1533000	The believer's chest is described as a niche inside of a wall.
1533360	1540880	In old homes, they used to build a little kind of Mehrab looking shape, cavity inside
1540880	1547160	a wall. You could put a candle in it and the light hits the curved wall and the light
1547160	1548760	spreads to the entire house.
1549240	1549560	Right.
1549880	1554920	And that niche, Allah gave the analogy of that and said, there's a lamp sitting in
1554920	1557000	that niche and it's spreading to the entire house.
1557280	1562120	But that lamp or that niche that Allah was describing is actually the rib cage.
1563320	1567000	And the lamp is actually the heart.
1567880	1568400	The heart.
1568440	1571760	And then the heart itself, Allah gave it light when he created us.
1572120	1573560	But then Allah sent a new light.
1573560	1574960	So what's the light?
1575080	1579720	The Quran itself and this outside light illuminates and lights it up and Allah
1579720	1583440	calls that Noor on a new light on top of light.
1583480	1586000	That's the analogy that Allah gave us in Surat al-Nui.
1586240	1591520	Now, having understood all of that, every time we come and by the way, that's in
1591520	1592080	that I,
1595120	1595640	interesting.
1596840	1600040	Here you're going to see, you know, Bayi and next I are going to see
1600040	1600440	the job.
1600720	1601600	Everything's connected.
1602280	1602480	Right.
1602480	1603600	The Quran is really amazing.
1603600	1604480	Intertextuality.
1604600	1611160	He says people who money or business and sales and trade does not distract them
1611160	1612080	from remembering Allah.
1612200	1614480	Wa iqamis-salaat and establishing the prayer.
1616000	1616960	Establishing the prayer.
1616960	1620080	Fi buyoutin adin Allahu an-tufa'u wa yuthkara fi asmoo.
1620400	1624760	There are homes in which Allah has allowed that his mention should be made
1625200	1626280	and they should be elevated.
1626320	1627840	Which homes is Allah talking about?
1628680	1629440	The masjids.
1629920	1630600	The masajid.
1630760	1631880	He's talking about the masajid.
1632240	1637280	Now, when we come to Jumu'ah, if you understand all of this imagery that I'm
1637280	1640760	giving you of light and of faith and how that's going to become turned into,
1640960	1643240	this is spiritual right now, light right now.
1643400	1646000	It's going to turn into real light on Judgment Day.
1646760	1648560	Where's actually going to be real darkness?
1648840	1651400	It's actually going to be a light coming out of us on Judgment Day.
1652120	1652360	Okay.
1652360	1660480	So this coming to Jumu'ah is us trying to strengthen our light.
1661400	1662600	To reinforce our light.
1662640	1667840	Now, when you stand in prayer every day, five times a day, you recharge your light
1667840	1668320	a little bit.
1669320	1669640	Okay.
1669960	1675600	So in cars, you need refueling every day, but every little longer, you need an oil
1675600	1678280	change and a little bit longer, you need to tune up.
1679480	1680040	Isn't it?
1680600	1684960	You should eat healthy every day, but then every so often you need to go to the
1684960	1688920	dentist and then every so often more, you need a full on cleaning.
1689440	1692480	And every there's a, there's immediate maintenance.
1693160	1695640	There's a little bit longer term maintenance and the super long term
1695640	1696480	maintenance, isn't it?
1696800	1699240	What spiritual maintenance every day for the Muslim?
1700080	1701240	It's the five prayers.
1701560	1703320	That's what cleans up the heart little by little.
1703560	1705840	That's the daily detox little by little.
1706440	1708880	Then every week there needs to be a major detox.
1709880	1710120	Okay.
1710120	1710760	Which is what?
1711440	1712080	That's Jumu'ah.
1712720	1713360	That's Jumu'ah.
1714160	1720000	And what's amazing about Jumu'ah is that if you study, there's a, there's only a
1720000	1722640	few khutbahs we have properly recorded of the Prophet.
1722640	1726360	So Allah, and I have a theory on why that is most of the time, even the
1726360	1730600	khutbah party was just telling people Quran already do that.
1731520	1732800	It was just reminding him of the Quran.
1733000	1735160	Literally, you know, he was gathering people and you're
1735160	1736800	going to add a, you're going to add a him.
1737520	1740200	I had to use that key and we are the moment, the
1741160	1743960	Jumu'ah was a, IA number two convention.
1745240	1747880	It was a gathering of just living IA number two every week.
1748680	1750280	Quran was being reinforced.
1750560	1752840	Quran was being reintroduced to the community.
1753000	1758080	And Allah is telling us in this last section that if you maintain the
1758080	1764000	spirit of the Friday prayer, because again, everything Allah gives us has a
1764000	1768920	letter and has a spirit and preserving the light inside is actually about the
1768920	1769880	spirit of it, isn't it?
1770560	1774560	If you can preserve the letter and the spirit of the Friday prayer, you will
1774560	1778600	not fall into the same trap that the people described in section number two
1778600	1779200	fell into.
1779480	1781720	That's why you should take this very, very serious.
1783440	1784520	Assalamu alaikum everyone.
1784560	1788720	There are almost 50,000 students around the world that are interested on top of
1788720	1792360	the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to
