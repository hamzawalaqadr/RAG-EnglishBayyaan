1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
This coming to Jumu'ah is us trying to strengthen our what?

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
Our light.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,720
To reinforce our light.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,560
Now, when you stand in prayer every day, five times a day, you recharge your light a little bit.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,840
Okay?

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,280
So in cars, you need refueling every day, but every little longer, you need an oil change.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,560
And a little bit longer, you need to tune up.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Isn't it?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Salamu alaikum.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,760
Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayna TV.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,920
I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in brief and then in great detail.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,080
And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanatv.com.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,640
And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also.

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,160
Thank you.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Salamu alaikum.

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,200
Once again, everybody, salamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi ta'ala wa l-akato.

17
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,400
We're going to start studying ayah number nine today.

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:45,480
And the first task is to try and understand the change of subject and the placement of this new final subject matter of surah al-Jumu'ah.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,560
As you already know, surah al-Jumu'ah is only 11 ayat.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:57,440
We're going to try to cover ayahs number nine and 10 today and conclude with ayah number 11 and an overview of the surah and some additional things inshallah, ta'ala, tomorrow.

21
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:05,560
The thing that I want you to understand is, you know, there are multiple ways to understand what is happening inside of a surah.

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,640
The surah of the Quran is not like a chapter in a book.

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,520
So I don't like the translation surah one, surah two, surah three as chapter one, chapter two, chapter three like that.

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,560
Because chapters, by definition, have a certain logic that everybody's familiar with.

25
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,920
Chapter three means you've or it's built on the ideas presented in chapter two, right?

26
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,240
And it depends on them in some way.

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,440
And if chapter three is going to need something that is going to be mentioned again from chapter two, it won't mention the whole thing again.

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,160
It'll just make a quick reference and then move forward, right?

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,920
So that's, by definition, chapters are chronological and they have a certain developmental order.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,840
So you cannot start a book and go to chapter 85 if you haven't read the first 84 chapters.

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,480
It doesn't make any sense.

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,360
But in the Quran, you know that we, even kids know,

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,760
qulwallahu ahad, allahu samad at the end of the Quran or inna aqtainakil qawthar at the end of the Quran.

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,360
And even though those are the final chapters in the order of the Quran, they're not dependent on earlier material, right?

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,560
So it doesn't really fit the definition of chapter.

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,920
Surahs have their own unique identity.

37
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,120
The other thing is inside a chapter.

38
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,240
That's just the chronology of chapters.

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,840
But even inside a chapter, you're supposed to have a progression of ideas.

40
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,800
So you're supposed to have, you know, some kind of one subject that one chapter deals with, right?

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,400
And then you don't have, if you wanted to have multiple topics, then you would turn them into multiple chapters.

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
That's what you would do.

43
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,880
What happens often in the Quran is you will have one surah, but the surah might have 20 topics.

44
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,040
It might have 15 topics.

45
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,880
It might have eight different topics.

46
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,440
It doesn't feel like a chapter.

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,720
It almost feels like a book by itself.

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,760
Even it feels on its own like an entire book.

49
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:08,120
And even then understanding why are these different topics, why are they all together in this?

50
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,480
In this way, why is this being called a surah?

51
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,320
So I'm not using the word chapter anymore.

52
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,920
I'm using the word surah.

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,480
So the surah has its own logic.

54
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,880
It's not the same as the logic you find in books and chapters and poetry and other kinds of literature.

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,120
It's its own unique standard.

56
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:36,560
And one of the mistakes we make in studying the Quran is one we say, well, because you're used to reading books in literature, in poetry,

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,120
stories, novels, science books, mathematics books, physics books, whatever books you're reading and whatever subject you're reading,

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,040
they have a certain structure in a certain order.

59
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,080
We have our minds are built and programmed to process information that way.

60
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,120
And we bring those expectations to the Quran.

61
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,760
And then the Quran does not meet those expectations, clearly.

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,760
And then it starts feeling like the Quran is unorganized.

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,200
That it's because it doesn't follow the logic that we're used to.

64
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,400
It looks like it's unorganized.

65
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,160
And two things happened in our history.

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,880
One thing that happened in our history is our scholars, they started accepting that idea.

67
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,920
They started, many of them accepted the idea that the Quran is actually not really logically organized.

68
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,560
There's no point in exploring why is it organized this way.

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,640
Let's just study each ayah as a lesson from Allah.

70
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,560
And the next ayah as a next lesson from Allah and the next ayah as the next lesson from Allah.

71
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,800
And sometimes we can see that this ayah is connected to this ayah and we can describe the connection.

72
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,480
Sometimes we cannot see the connection.

73
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,360
It seems like it's completely disconnected.

74
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,960
And there you'll find that many scholars won't even discuss what just happened.

75
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,480
They'll just say, now Allah is talking about this.

76
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,120
But not say, why is he talking about this?

77
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,640
I wonder why what happened here?

78
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,720
Why did the subject change all of a second?

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:07,400
Even as an English reader of the translation of the Quran, you might notice a very abrupt, shocking change in subject.

80
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,840
Immediately without warning.

81
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,720
And you can feel it.

82
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,320
You can feel something just shifted.

83
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,960
And it's actually meant to almost disturb the reader.

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,040
Because the flow, like when you're listening to recitation of the Quran, it has a flow.

85
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,400
It's just called, especially a good reciter.

86
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,080
They're reciting the Quran and there's this endless continuous flow.

87
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,040
You just want them to keep on reciting.

88
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,800
Right?

89
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,600
But then when you're reading the translation, you're like, this is very cut up.

90
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
This is very disjointed.

91
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,160
So it actually doesn't seem like it has a flow.

92
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:50,560
Now, one way to understand the way things are organized in the Quran, I showed you some of the slides on the end of a section and how things are very uniquely organized inside of a chapter.

93
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:50,840
Right?

94
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,960
And that's not easy to hear because it's not going the order of A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

95
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,600
It's going A, B, C, and then A, B, C again.

96
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:09,720
Or it's going A, B, C, and then C, B, A, or something like that, which is more complicated than just A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,360
It's not the same kind of structure.

98
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,680
But at the same time as that is there, and that's, you know, whatever surahs I've worked on, I've seen those kinds of structures in all of those surahs.

99
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,240
And I've tried to explain that kind of a design to the surahs of the Quran.

100
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,120
Many people have been working on this and they've done some amazing, amazing work, especially in the last 30, 40 years.

101
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,120
Quite a bit of work has been done on the structural analysis of the Quran.

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,000
I think it's very fascinating, interesting work.

103
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,000
Some of this was done in classical times by scholars, very little.

104
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,400
But now it's become an entire, you can think of it, it's become an entire department in Quran studies by itself.

105
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,800
But then there's another part to the logic of surahs.

106
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,720
And that is, I like to call it linear coherence.

107
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:01,000
Linear coherence means, when I start my speech, between the start of my speech and the end of my speech, there needs to be a logical continuity.

108
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,880
Like A needs to make sense to move into B and B needs to make sense to move into C.

109
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,720
So you can see the conclusion of my argument, right?

110
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,760
Sometimes you listen to a speech and the speaker is talking about everything.

111
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,800
And everything was really cool.

112
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,960
But at the end of the speech, you're like, so what did he talk about?

113
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,400
I don't know, but it was awesome.

114
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,040
You don't remember because it wasn't methodically structured.

115
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,120
It wasn't organized.

116
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,360
You know, but a lecture in a class, like when you go to your professor at school, a good teacher is going to have a plan.

117
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,840
Here's how I'm going to introduce the subject.

118
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,880
Then I'm going to give examples.

119
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,280
Then I'm going to do review.

120
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,720
And then I'll conclude by recapping the entire lesson.

121
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,080
But they'll have a plan in their head.

122
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,520
A, B, C, D, and then come back to A and finish it all up, right?

123
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,480
They have a lesson.

124
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
It's called a lesson plan.

125
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,360
Now, Allah says, you know, I'll have a Quran and we saw here, you are the book.

126
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,160
He teaches them the book and teaching needs curriculum.

127
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,000
Speaking does not need curriculum.

128
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,160
When you're speaking to a friend, you don't need a plan.

129
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,840
You just talk.

130
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,600
But when you're teaching someone, you have a teacher does not think about what's on their mind.

131
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,000
A teacher thinks about how do I get this into the mind of my student that it stays there?

132
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, which is different from informing someone like the news on the radio or the news online.

133
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,760
The news is not teaching you.

134
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
The news is just informing you.

135
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,640
So it's a lot of information.

136
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,480
It's not expecting you to remember that information.

137
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,600
You can grab bits and pieces that you find interesting and you can move on.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,880
Maybe 95%, 99% of it, you don't care.

139
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
The news is telling you there's traffic over there.

140
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,520
There's an accident over there.

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,280
There's this over there.

142
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,520
But there's one road that they mentioned that that's the one you're taking.

143
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,760
That's all you care about.

144
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,880
You know, all that information, it disappears from your mind because the news report is

145
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,480
informing you, but it's not teaching you.

146
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,320
But when a teacher teaches you, then the teacher expects that you should be able to remember

147
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,560
and reuse all the things that were taught to you.

148
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,000
You understand.

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,360
So there's a deeper relationship because in all of them, someone's talking and you're listening.

150
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,240
A teacher is talking and you're listening.

151
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,240
A speaker is talking and you're listening.

152
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,400
The radio is talking and you're listening.

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,160
All of them are just you're getting taking data inside.

154
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,960
Information is going inside.

155
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,960
But there's a fundamental difference the moment we use the word teaching.

156
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,520
Now, for teaching, a plan is really important.

157
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,040
That's the next part.

158
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,680
Teaching does not happen without a real plan.

159
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,640
A teacher has a strategy that by the end of this lesson, I have some goals.

160
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
I want my students to walk away with.

161
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,800
Now, what are the goals of the Quran?

162
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,680
The goals of the Quran is one of them is that you make an effort to remember.

163
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,360
So Allah wants to put things in a way that will make it easy for you to remember.

164
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,800
And of course, one of the reasons the Quran is so miraculously easy to memorize

165
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,960
is actually because part of the design of the Quran was these lessons should be forever

166
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,520
remembered and you shouldn't have to go and open a copy of a book and then

167
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,760
access these lessons.

168
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,800
They should just flow out of you on your drive home.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,040
You're just reciting a surah that you memorize it and you're just reciting it.

170
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,840
Right.

171
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,520
And for thousands of years, Muslims have been memorizing parts of the Quran or

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,320
the entire Quran, those lessons become a part of them.

173
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,920
So we made the Quran easy for remembrance.

174
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,960
By the way, making something easy is the job of a teacher, isn't it?

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,240
Right.

176
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,840
Because a speaker doesn't have to make something easy.

177
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,960
A king doesn't have to make something easy.

178
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,640
But a teacher has to make something easy, unless speaking in the role of a teacher.

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,320
The other thing that a teacher does, that's the difference between a good teacher

180
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,480
and a bad teacher, a good teacher or let's start with a bad teacher, a bad teacher.

181
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,280
Like we have many of those in the world.

182
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,360
They'll come and sit in the class and say to the kids, read chapter three.

183
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,960
And then they're doing their own thing.

184
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,680
Like just learn it yourself.

185
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,920
All the exams on chapter five study.

186
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,920
Are you going to review it?

187
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,440
Are you going to help us understand it?

188
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,880
Are you going to know the book tells you everything you need to know?

189
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,640
In other words, their idea is so long as you have the information, you deal with it.

190
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,600
But what happens to you growing up or even in university, you're reading the text,

191
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,400
you're reading the chapter, you're reading all the information, but it's just isolated

192
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,160
bits of data, but you don't see how it makes sense.

193
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,760
It's not, it's not making sense to you.

194
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,720
It's disconnected.

195
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,360
Then you go to someone who's a better student or someone who's a tutor or someone who's

196
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,520
a, you know, doing internship or whatever you say, can you help me understand this?

197
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,040
And in five minutes, they take this complicated chapter and what do they do?

198
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,040
They help you.

199
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,000
You know, this idea, this is connected to this.

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,400
And then you say, you're sitting there in the library going, Oh, it's like that.

201
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,160
Oh my God.

202
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,120
Why didn't they just do that?

203
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Why didn't they just say that?

204
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,520
Why do they make it so hard?

205
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,360
Many of you have had those moments in your life.

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,600
And then you, some of you, sometimes you've had a teacher in your life who's really good

207
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,880
at taking complicated subjects and making them, what?

208
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,600
Making them easy.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,320
Right.

210
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,840
So what does Allah do?

211
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,520
Allah actually teaches in a way that makes things easy.

212
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,600
And so the Quran, somebody mentioned yesterday, the sister from Italy, from the

213
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,760
place of bad pizzas mentioned yesterday that, you know, the Quran is simply in her

214
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,080
own words, she said that the Quran is not presenting something in complicated language.

215
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,320
It's presenting it in very simplified language.

216
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,520
And that's actually true.

217
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,280
Allah, the one who knows more than any PhD knows and has more vocabulary than any

218
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,520
human being can ever have, can use the hardest words possible.

219
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,120
And if Allah wants to talk to me about Jewish history, he will, he has no more

220
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,040
knowledge of Jewish history than the Encyclopedia Britannica or the entire volumes

221
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,680
of Jewish history.

222
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
And he knows the chapters of history that have been lost.

223
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,840
He knows all of it.

224
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,320
He knows the map of the world better than anybody else.

225
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,400
Right.

226
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,120
He knows, he knows the places that are ruins that are buried deep inside the ground

227
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,360
and we haven't even found them yet.

228
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,960
The nations that have been lost.

229
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,680
He knows them.

230
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,360
We don't know them.

231
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,600
He could talk about them in much more sophisticated, complicated ways.

232
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,520
But he chose not to give us information in the Quran.

233
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,600
He chose to educate us.

234
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,720
And the goal, the first goal of education is to remember.

235
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,200
And the second goal of education, it seems to be in the Quran, is to change

236
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,040
the way you think.

237
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,040
Now, so Allah is less concerned with the volume of information.

238
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,240
Allah is more concerned with the way you and I think.

239
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,400
Actually, so this is really, really cool and really important.

240
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
That means we are, we can be obsessed with knowledge.

241
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
I want to learn Arabic.

242
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,920
I want to learn to see that we'll learn Hadith.

243
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,080
I want to learn fit that we'll learn Islamic history.

244
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,520
I want to learn philosophy.

245
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,000
I want to learn comparative religion, learn, learn, learn information, information,

246
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,080
information, information, information.

247
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,720
But actually, at the end of every little lesson, every single thing you learn in

248
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,720
the end, how did this change the way I what?

249
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,520
How I think.

250
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,640
How did this change the way I think?

251
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,840
My worldview has to enhance in some way.

252
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,440
With that in mind, I want you to know that every surah of the Quran has a certain

253
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,000
point. It wants you to get, it wants to get a certain way of thinking across to you.

254
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,120
This surah that we're studying, we're starting the final section of the surah.

255
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
It's made up of three sections.

256
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,400
There are three sections.

257
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,880
In the first section, Allah described how, what his plan is for that he gave to

258
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,960
his Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, to make sure that the final

259
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,560
prophet gives people the book and they have a relationship with the people.

260
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,480
Have a relationship with their book that is made up of four components.

261
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,320
It's not one relationship, it's four relationships.

262
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,600
Yatlu'a'adahim a'ati, wa yuzakkihim, wa yu'alimu mulkitab, wa l-hikmah.

263
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
And then the ummah will grow, but these four elements of the relationship will

264
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,120
remain forever. They must remain in place.

265
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,960
That was the agenda of the first section of the surah.

266
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,640
This is what a real relationship with the book looks like.

267
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,120
Okay.

268
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,960
The second section looked like it went somewhere else completely.

269
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,680
Where did we go?

270
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,560
We went into Jewish history.

271
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,080
We went into people that were given the Torah and they didn't carry it the way

272
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,960
they were supposed to.

273
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,920
Actually, it's kind of like the way you would translate that is they carried it

274
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,080
without carrying it.

275
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,320
Because if I didn't describe this to you at the time, Allah says the example of

276
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,560
those who were given the burden of the Torah, then they didn't carry it.

277
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,680
By the end of that sentence, did they carry it or did they not carry?

278
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,600
They did not carry.

279
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,000
But the example is not of a donkey that does not carry.

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,480
The example is of a donkey that does carry.

281
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,120
So Allah is saying it looks like he's carrying, but he's not really carrying.

282
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,840
He's carrying without carrying.

283
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,800
You understand?

284
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,000
So the lesson being taught was it may...

285
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,400
Here's an example of people that were given a book.

286
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,880
Now you've been given the Quran.

287
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,920
People before you were not given Quran.

288
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,040
They were given their own Quran, which was called Torah.

289
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,280
And they were supposed to follow a four step process.

290
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,240
But when they didn't follow that process, they still had the book.

291
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,800
They were still carrying it, but not really carrying it.

292
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,880
So now that second section was actually there to give us a case study.

293
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,480
What happens when people stop carrying the book the right way?

294
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,040
And then we were told, these people, when you don't carry the book the right

295
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,520
way, some problems happen.

296
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,000
One problem that happens is you start thinking just because we have the book.

297
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,880
Allah must really love us more than he loves anybody else.

298
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,720
So no matter how bad we are in the end, we're still going to go to Jannah anyway.

299
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,080
Right?

300
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,760
And they developed that mentality.

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,600
And if we become distant from the book, we will develop that mentality.

302
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,800
The second thing that happened with them is they became really scared of death.

303
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,960
Like death was not a...

304
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,320
They didn't have to love death, but there was something that terrifies them.

305
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,160
When you accept the worldview of the Quran, then the first thing you realize is

306
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,640
Allah, one of the first things Allah wants you to know is that you are at this

307
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,040
timeline, you're in this place.

308
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Where did this story begin with Adam, and where is the story going to end?

309
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,240
It's going to end on judgment day in Jannah and Nahr.

310
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:38,720
Right?

311
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
And you're on the midpoint.

312
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,240
And what the Quran does is it makes you realize your life didn't start when you

313
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
came out of your mom.

314
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,800
Your life started at the time of Adam.

315
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,680
So your life is pretty long.

316
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,080
It's been going on for a long time.

317
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,000
And you're in an episode right now, and there are next episodes coming.

318
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,400
And now that you know where you came from, you have a better idea where you're

319
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,520
going.

320
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,280
So it changes your perspective about life and death.

321
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,520
It changes the perspective of who you actually are.

322
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,120
Where did your life begin?

323
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,120
What's your identity?

324
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,720
You know, what's your relationship with reality?

325
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,520
It changes.

326
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,960
And because that changes the way you look at history changes and also the way you

327
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,480
look at the future changes.

328
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,280
And then you no longer, you're no longer terrified of the concept of death.

329
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,680
You're not running from it.

330
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,680
You're not trying to stay alive forever.

331
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,640
You're not doing that anymore because you know there's a meeting coming.

332
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,640
This your existence started with a meeting with Allah and your existence at the end

333
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,120
of it is also, it also has a meeting with Allah.

334
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,960
So where you began is where you're going to end up.

335
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,160
This is why we say when a person dies in Nalilahi wa inna ilayhi l-ajirun,

336
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,400
we are, we belong to Allah also means we started with Allah and we're going back

337
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,160
to where we started.

338
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,560
Kama badaakum ta'udun da Quran says the way he started you, you're going to come back.

339
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,840
Okay.

340
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,560
So he's, you know,

341
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,000
Thumma n'u'iduhu,

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,360
On n'u'iduhu al-Khalq, we will bring the creation back to where the whole thing started.

343
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,600
This perspective now doesn't make me feel like I am terrified of death.

344
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,720
It's just one chapter among many chapters that are coming.

345
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,520
There was many chapters before and there are chapters coming after, right?

346
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,480
Now, so this is what happened with that.

347
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,600
Now the final section of the Surah.

348
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,640
It is now telling us if you don't want to fall into the same mistakes that were

349
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,360
described in section two, I'm going to give you a solution, this Udmah.

350
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,400
I'm going to give you a solution that every time your relationship with your book and

351
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,960
with this revelation is getting rusty.

352
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,560
Every few days later, you will come together and you will restore your

353
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,560
relationship with the Quran and with Allah and you will be reminded of a

354
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,160
gathering that is coming, which is judgment day.

355
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,800
By the way, this is Surah number 62.

356
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,600
In Surah number 64, Allah will call judgment day, Yawmul Jam'a, the day of

357
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,800
gathering, Yawmul Jam'a.

358
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,800
And this day, the Friday prayer is Yawmul Jumu'a.

359
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,280
The purpose of Yawmul Jumu'a is to remind me at the end of every week of

360
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,000
Yawmul Jam'a.

361
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,280
Okay.

362
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,560
And in Yawmul Jumu'a, what do believers do?

363
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,920
They willingly come forward in the presence of the reminder, the word of Allah.

364
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,120
What is judgment day?

365
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,160
Humanity will come forward and Allah will speak to them.

366
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,000
Allah will speak, isn't it?

367
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,160
And now the people who came towards Allah willingly are going to be given

368
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,120
light on judgment day.

369
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,320
Now let's complete this imagery, the way the imagery is being designed in these

370
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,800
Surahs.

371
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,000
The first Surah of the series of these Surahs was Surah number 57, Surat Al-Hadeed.

372
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,840
And in Surat Al-Hadeed, Allah said a couple of really cool things.

373
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,680
One of them related to Surat Al-Jumu'a is,

374
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,880
When Lathiyyu nazilu aada abdihi ayatin bayinatin,

375
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,760
liyukhrijakum min al-zulumati ilan nurah, I referenced this yesterday.

376
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,440
He is the one who sends down on his slave, meaning Muhammad, Sadat-ul-Aqqali,

377
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,880
he sends down on his slave clear ayat, clear miraculous signs from Allah,

378
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,200
meaning the Quran.

379
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,040
He sends Quran on Muhammad, Salat-ul-Aqqali, liyukhrijakum min al-zulumati ilan

380
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,240
nurah, so he can pull you out of multiple shades of darkness into light.

381
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,960
He can pull you out of darknesses towards light.

382
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,360
Okay.

383
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,720
So now the imagery is, if you're coming closer to Allah, you're walking away from

384
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,960
darkness and you're walking towards light.

385
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Now, this is 62 in the Surah-ul-Aqqali, what does Allah say?

386
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,160
يطلع عليهما ياته ويزكهه ويعلمه ملكتابة والحكمة وإنكاله

387
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,640
من قبله لفيضل المبين.

388
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,880
Let me put this in other words.

389
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,560
He goes through this four step process with you because he's getting you out of

390
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,400
darknesses into light.

391
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,520
This is how he does it.

392
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,160
This is, so that's what was introduced in Surah number 57 is now being explained

393
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
in Surah number 62.

394
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,480
And here Allah says, and they were utterly lost.

395
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,560
يكادوا من قبله لفيضل المبين.

396
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
They were utterly lost.

397
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Imagine the imagery of Musa A.S. when he was lost in the desert with his family.

398
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
What was it that gave him guidance?

399
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,280
He in a distance, he saw what?

400
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,560
He saw light, right?

401
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,880
So we're in the darkness.

402
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,160
We're in Zadam.

403
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,000
We're in Zadal.

404
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,280
And then Allah gave light so that we have direction.

405
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,120
We have guidance.

406
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,560
Now, let's go back to Surah number 57.

407
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,880
Allah says, judgment day will come and believers will wake up on judgment day and

408
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,080
they're going to have يصعى نورهم بين ايديهم وبي ايمانهم.

409
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,600
They will have light coming from in front of them and from their right sides.

410
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,720
They'll have light coming out of them.

411
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,240
And this light, the one that's coming from us, from ourselves and from our right,

412
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,240
is actually been described as the light of Imam, the light of faith from our chest

413
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,160
and the light of our good deeds by our right hand, which is pretty cool.

414
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,240
Because يطلع عليهم آياته ويزكيهم is here.

415
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,080
And ويعلمهم الكتابة والحكمة is here.

416
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,240
Isn't it?

417
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,080
And that's the light that we're going to need on judgment day.

418
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,200
Now that light in this life, we have to preserve it.

419
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,360
Okay, Allah says, يجعلكم نورا تمشون به.

420
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,520
اتي انه سرط الحديد.

421
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,680
He says, He will put a light for you that you can walk in.

422
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
He'll provide a light for you that you can walk in.

423
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,120
Now the whole and then سرط التغابون, later on, the same surah that

424
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,560
calls judgment day يوم الجمع says, فَاَامِنُوا بِلَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَنُوْدِ الَّذِيَ انْزَلْنَا

425
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,360
Believe in Allah, believe in His Messenger and believe in the light that we set down.

426
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,880
So now what is the light in سرط التغابون?

427
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,160
The Quran.

428
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,640
So there's a light on judgment day that I need to walk.

429
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,520
The Prophet is pulling people out of darkness into light.

430
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,960
And the Quran now itself is being described as light.

431
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,320
And so this light can become weak.

432
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,920
In human beings, it can become weak.

433
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,320
So with it, Allah do he created multiple institutions to re to re trigger the light.

434
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,480
Five times of prayer, the five prayers.

435
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Allah describes the analogy of the person praying before Allah in

436
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,040
the surah of light, the passage of light.

437
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,000
The believer's chest is described as a niche inside of a wall.

438
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:40,880
In old homes, they used to build a little kind of Mehrab looking shape, cavity inside

439
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,160
a wall. You could put a candle in it and the light hits the curved wall and the light

440
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,760
spreads to the entire house.

441
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,560
Right.

442
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,920
And that niche, Allah gave the analogy of that and said, there's a lamp sitting in

443
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,000
that niche and it's spreading to the entire house.

444
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,120
But that lamp or that niche that Allah was describing is actually the rib cage.

445
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,000
And the lamp is actually the heart.

446
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,400
The heart.

447
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,760
And then the heart itself, Allah gave it light when he created us.

448
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,560
But then Allah sent a new light.

449
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,960
So what's the light?

450
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,720
The Quran itself and this outside light illuminates and lights it up and Allah

451
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,440
calls that Noor on a new light on top of light.

452
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,000
That's the analogy that Allah gave us in Surat al-Nui.

453
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,520
Now, having understood all of that, every time we come and by the way, that's in

454
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,080
that I,

455
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,640
interesting.

456
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,040
Here you're going to see, you know, Bayi and next I are going to see

457
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,440
the job.

458
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,600
Everything's connected.

459
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,480
Right.

460
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,600
The Quran is really amazing.

461
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,480
Intertextuality.

462
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:51,160
He says people who money or business and sales and trade does not distract them

463
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,080
from remembering Allah.

464
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,480
Wa iqamis-salaat and establishing the prayer.

465
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,960
Establishing the prayer.

466
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,080
Fi buyoutin adin Allahu an-tufa'u wa yuthkara fi asmoo.

467
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,760
There are homes in which Allah has allowed that his mention should be made

468
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,280
and they should be elevated.

469
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,840
Which homes is Allah talking about?

470
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,440
The masjids.

471
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,600
The masajid.

472
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,880
He's talking about the masajid.

473
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,280
Now, when we come to Jumu'ah, if you understand all of this imagery that I'm

474
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,760
giving you of light and of faith and how that's going to become turned into,

475
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,240
this is spiritual right now, light right now.

476
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,000
It's going to turn into real light on Judgment Day.

477
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,560
Where's actually going to be real darkness?

478
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,400
It's actually going to be a light coming out of us on Judgment Day.

479
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,360
Okay.

480
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,480
So this coming to Jumu'ah is us trying to strengthen our light.

481
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,600
To reinforce our light.

482
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,840
Now, when you stand in prayer every day, five times a day, you recharge your light

483
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,320
a little bit.

484
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,640
Okay.

485
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,600
So in cars, you need refueling every day, but every little longer, you need an oil

486
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,280
change and a little bit longer, you need to tune up.

487
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,040
Isn't it?

488
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,960
You should eat healthy every day, but then every so often you need to go to the

489
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,920
dentist and then every so often more, you need a full on cleaning.

490
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
And every there's a, there's immediate maintenance.

491
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,640
There's a little bit longer term maintenance and the super long term

492
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,480
maintenance, isn't it?

493
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,240
What spiritual maintenance every day for the Muslim?

494
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,240
It's the five prayers.

495
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,320
That's what cleans up the heart little by little.

496
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,840
That's the daily detox little by little.

497
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,880
Then every week there needs to be a major detox.

498
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,120
Okay.

499
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,760
Which is what?

500
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,080
That's Jumu'ah.

501
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,360
That's Jumu'ah.

502
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:40,000
And what's amazing about Jumu'ah is that if you study, there's a, there's only a

503
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,640
few khutbahs we have properly recorded of the Prophet.

504
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,360
So Allah, and I have a theory on why that is most of the time, even the

505
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,600
khutbah party was just telling people Quran already do that.

506
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,800
It was just reminding him of the Quran.

507
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,160
Literally, you know, he was gathering people and you're

508
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,800
going to add a, you're going to add a him.

509
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,200
I had to use that key and we are the moment, the

510
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,960
Jumu'ah was a, IA number two convention.

511
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,880
It was a gathering of just living IA number two every week.

512
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,280
Quran was being reinforced.

513
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,840
Quran was being reintroduced to the community.

514
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,080
And Allah is telling us in this last section that if you maintain the

515
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,000
spirit of the Friday prayer, because again, everything Allah gives us has a

516
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,920
letter and has a spirit and preserving the light inside is actually about the

517
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,880
spirit of it, isn't it?

518
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,560
If you can preserve the letter and the spirit of the Friday prayer, you will

519
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,600
not fall into the same trap that the people described in section number two

520
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,200
fell into.

521
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,720
That's why you should take this very, very serious.

522
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,520
Assalamu alaikum everyone.

523
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,720
There are almost 50,000 students around the world that are interested on top of

524
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,360
the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to

525
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,280
learn that and share that with family and friends.

526
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,880
And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive.

527
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,920
So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our

528
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,600
sponsorship page.

529
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,680
I appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're

530
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,240
able to share the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it the world over.
