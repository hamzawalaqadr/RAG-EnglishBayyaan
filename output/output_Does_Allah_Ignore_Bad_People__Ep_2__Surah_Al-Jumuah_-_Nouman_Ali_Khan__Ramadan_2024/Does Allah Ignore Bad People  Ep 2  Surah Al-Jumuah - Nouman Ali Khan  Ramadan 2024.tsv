0	5840	Or as if Allah doesn't know what's really going on. This is important. We say it's easy to say Allah knows everything
6360	8160	easy to say
8160	14660	And then people say Assad, you know some people they do really bad things, but they don't look like they get punished
15800	17800	Like how come why why is Allah doing that?
18080	23160	And then you're like yeah, but what Allah is gonna like punish them on judgment day or what? Oh
23880	26120	So he has to explain to you what he's gonna do
26760	28760	This is how this works
28760	32000	Because when judgment day begins and everybody's about to be judged you're like hold on a lot
32000	35680	I just want to make sure this guy who stole my ketchup from McDonald's
36320	38320	Gets what he deserves
38360	40360	Now we may begin
40600	45660	Okay, we have this sense of entitlement that somehow Allah owes us an explanation
45960	53320	O makar Allah, who liyeq di aakum adal ghayb Allah says Allah does not is not going to be one to inform you of what he does in the unseen
53360	55360	Why does he have to tell you?
59520	61400	I
63900	65900	Gaming
78560	84560	We're Bush about me with silly
84560	91560	And I'll see you in a minute.
91560	98600	Surah Al-Jumu'ah, which is typical of this group of Surahs, especially the
98600	102680	Musabihaat, meaning the Surahs that begin with the Tasbih of Allah, the five of
102680	111280	them in this group, are very deep and loaded beginnings. So my intention is to
111280	116080	try and finish our discussion on the first ayah today. It looks unlikely, but I'm
116080	119840	going to not rush through it. I want to be able to cover everything that I wanted
119840	125000	to share with you in some detail, inshaAllah, and see how we progress. Anyway,
125000	129240	so the first conversation I want to have with you is about the word Tasbih or
129240	134480	the word Yusam Bihul that occurs in the ayah. Once again, in an easy translation,
134480	138960	the first part of this ayah is, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in
138960	145400	the earth, does and will continue to do Tasbih of Allah, meaning declares and
145400	150840	will continue to declare the perfection of Allah. One of the most important
150840	157320	studies in the Quran is the study of words. So Arabic is really unique because
157320	163240	every word has an etymology and an entire story behind it. So I just said
163240	167760	declares the perfection of Allah. That's an easy English translation. But behind
167800	174000	this word is imagery. This word Tasbih comes from Saba'a and Saba'a has some
174000	178320	images associated with it. So as we will go through this series of lectures,
178320	182760	every time we come across a word, we're going to go look in the background of
182760	187040	that word. Where does word come from? How are the Arabs using the associated
187040	190440	words? And then how do we get to the meaning of the word that we're dealing
190440	194200	with in this ayah? Okay, so those secondary meanings, those background
194240	197560	meanings, they help us get a deep understanding of the word that Allah is
197560	201840	using. So let's start with Tasbih, which is coming from the letters,
201840	207880	Sain, Ba and Ha. Those are the root letters of this word, Saba'a. Saba'a. Siba'a
207880	212440	were actually unstitched, hide or leather garments. I couldn't find a better
212440	217960	picture than that. But anyway, ancient times babies had clothes, but they didn't
217960	222080	have any stitching on the side. You just stick the arms in and the neck in and it
222120	227240	just flows, right? So it doesn't, you can't tell if the baby's fat or skinny
227240	233120	because it's all just kind of flowing. So that, which doesn't stick to the body,
233120	238680	right? Doesn't contour to the body. Those kinds of clothes were called Siba'a. It
238680	243000	also means to be stretched or extended out. Tasbih is used when you're stretching
243000	247440	leather. That's actually called Tasbih or stretching a string or a rope or
247440	251480	something like that. So so far we got the meaning of something that doesn't, you
251520	255680	know, dip down into the shape of the body and something that's stretched out,
255680	265080	leveled out. Then Tasbih is actually when you swim and you don't go underwater. So
265080	269520	you're swimming, but you stay above the water the whole time. If you go under the
269520	273880	water and you come up, that's called Al-Aun. It's a different word for swimming.
273880	279280	But Saba'a is actually, or Saba'a the verb is actually when you, when you don't
279360	284040	dip at all, you stay above. So now we've got this idea, this concept of something
284040	288000	stretched out like a straight line, something that doesn't dip into the body
288000	293520	of the child, and even a swimmer that doesn't dip under the water. He maintains
293520	298760	or she maintains the level. Fara Siba'a, Saba'a, a horse was described as Saba'a
298760	304480	that extends its legs out as far as it can. So when it gallops, it stretches its
304560	311440	legs out. So it's called Hasanu Mad-din-yadain-fil-jari, meaning it extends
311440	316840	as far as it can when it runs. So being extended and engaged without being
316840	321200	immersed. Likewise, like the swimmer who won't submerge, meaning the swimmer that
321200	325040	won't go down, the child's loose garment doesn't contour to the body and
325040	330120	thus doesn't immerse into the form of the child. That's why outer garments are
330160	336680	called Qisa'a Musab'ah, meaning spread out. Thus, constant activity with no
336680	339560	downtime. This is interesting. If you're working, working, working and you never
339560	343400	take a break, like the swimmer who never goes under the water, that's actually
343400	346760	called Saba'ah. And it's used for the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
346760	352000	when Allah says, Inna Laka'a Finna Haari, Saba'a An Taweela. You have long,
352000	359160	endless, breakless, you know, seamless tasks work to do where you're not going
359200	363800	to get any breaks. And that's called Saba'ah, maintaining. From this came the
363800	369120	idea of not being brought down in any way. In other words, I'm not going to say
369120	375440	anything about Allah that brings down His perfection. So the idea of this
375440	380480	be is maintaining or floating our concept of Allah and not letting it drown
380480	384320	even a little bit, or not letting it weaken even a little bit in any way,
384320	388680	right? So the way that the scholars talked about this, for example, what
388680	393840	doesn't be fit His Majesty's perfection. But some of it has to do with being
393840	404600	declared perfect. Meaning that you say something that is not appropriate for
404600	413040	Him, whether it's a partner or a child, or if you say Allah made
413040	417400	something without a purpose. By the way, that's philosophically all. Allah says
417720	421240	He created the skies and the earth with purpose. You know what that means? That
421240	426160	He created me with a purpose. But it also means every situation He created, He
426160	432280	also created with a purpose. Every disadvantage in my life was for a
432280	437520	purpose. Every advantage of my life was for a purpose. Every test was for a
437520	442960	purpose. You know, every ability and every disability was for a purpose. And the
442960	447360	moment I start thinking, I don't see the point why Allah did this, I pretty
447400	453160	look pretty purposeless to me that this be of Allah is going away. Because Allah
453160	458480	never does something without purpose, right? So that's important. Now,
458480	463920	An Yorab el-Basar, that He can be seen, you know, like I used to have a co-worker
463920	470960	back in New York when I was in college in 1864. And she told me, hey, you're
470960	475440	religious, right? I was like, a little bit. And she said, I saw God in my dream
475480	479280	last night. I was like, no, you didn't. It's like, no, I did. I was like, no,
479280	484600	that was the devil. That was the devil. It wasn't a, she said, then she said, he
484600	489080	looked like you. I was like, that was definitely the devil. Definitely the
489080	489800	devil. Okay.
492240	496560	And ta'alama mulaika tuhum ma'alami ya'alimhum. Or you know, saying something
496560	500680	like, you know, the angels saying that, you know, how can we know something you
500680	504960	didn't teach us? Even the angels claiming I could even know something that you
505160	510840	didn't teach us. This is subhanaka la'ilbalana illama alamtana. How perfect you
510840	515240	are. How can we know anything that you didn't teach us? Right? So even me
515240	520120	thinking I know something that didn't actually, you know, my knowledge, my
520120	526200	experience, my skill somehow came from somewhere other than Allah. Right? That's
526200	532040	also taking away from perfection of Allah. An yakhfa aleyhi makru shar. Or as if
532080	535920	Allah doesn't know what's really going on. This is important. We say it's easy
535920	541440	to say Allah knows everything. Easy to say. But then people are like, and we
541440	546120	easy to say Allah is fair. Allah is just. And then people say, Assad, you know,
546120	549840	some people, they do really bad things, but they don't look like they get
549840	554760	punished. Like, how come? Why? Why is all the doing that? Like, doesn't he know
554760	560560	that they did something bad? I'm like, do you know what you're saying? Who are
560600	563800	you talking about here? You're talking about Allah? And you're saying, doesn't
563800	566920	he know you don't know the answer to that question? You don't already know that
566920	571960	he knows? And then you're like, yeah, but what? Allah is going to like punish them
571960	576200	on judgment day or what? Oh, so he has to explain to you what he's going to do.
576200	580720	This is how this works. Because when judgment day begins and everybody's
580720	583760	about to be judged, you're like, hold on a lot. I just want to make sure this guy
583760	589560	who stole my ketchup from McDonald's gets what he deserves. Now we may begin.
589760	595800	We have this sense of entitlement that somehow Allah owes us an explanation.
595800	603520	Allah says, Allah is not going to be one to inform you of what he does in the unseen.
603520	607080	Why does he have to tell you? And you know, there's this disease that we have now
607080	612040	that, you know, things happen in my life, things happen in your life. And people
612040	615600	really question Allah. Why did that happen? Why did that happen to me? Right? And
616160	621280	then they say, my faith is in crisis until Allah reveals to me the secret behind
621280	625880	why this happened to me. Until I know why this happened to me. I don't know. I
625880	629760	don't know if I can trust Allah because I don't see the logic in it. He needs to
629760	635600	convince me of his logic before I can move on. This is the height of arrogance.
636280	640040	And it's all we don't. It's our dissatisfaction will be allow it to turn
640040	645000	into arrogance. Arrabbu Rabb, the master is the master. He doesn't owe me an
645040	650600	explanation. I have to humble myself before him. You know, I was when I was
650600	654960	teaching through the Dariyat. Ibrahim, alaihi salam's wife was very old. You
654960	658840	know that, right? And Allah sent the angels and what did the angels tell her?
660440	664840	You're going to have a baby. She could have been like, oh, yeah, now.
666600	674760	Well, I was 20, I was 21, 22, 30, 40. You want to come tell me I'm going to
674760	679880	have a baby when I can't even sit down without my bones cracking? Now I'm
679880	684000	going to have a baby. This is this is wisdom. This is what wisdom looks like.
685000	686880	This is the last plan. Huh?
689240	690400	She could have done that. Yes or no?
691520	694440	Because can she see the logic in it? No.
694640	696560	Can anybody see the logic in it? No.
697680	700520	All these years I'm living in depression because I can't give you.
700520	702200	Ibrahim, alaihi salam, a child.
703360	707320	And now, now when I'm probably going to die before he gets old, now you're going
707320	709680	to give me a child. What does the angel say there?
711120	712480	God, I keep calling Rambuki.
712480	713960	Inna hu hu al hakeemun Ali.
714520	716920	This is what you're this is exactly how your master said it.
717680	718840	We're just delivering the news.
719560	723120	I didn't come up with the policy. I'm here to deliver the package.
724360	725200	Just this one.
725680	726920	Qadali ki qadar Rambuki.
727640	729720	He has all the wisdom and he knows.
730840	732560	Meaning you need to trust what?
733400	735640	The wisdom of Allah. The wisdom of Allah is perfect.
735960	737240	The knowledge of Allah is perfect.
737600	741040	It's not like he didn't know my situation and then he made this decision or he
741040	743280	didn't consider everything before he made a decision.
743600	745160	He makes a decision knowing everything.
745560	747800	I'm the one who has lack in knowledge, not him.
748360	750320	I'm the one who has lack in wisdom, not him.
750720	752400	This is part of the tisbiha of Allah.
752920	755680	The absolute flawless nature of his lordship.
755680	759160	So the word tisbiha and we'll dive into this a little bit more.
759640	762320	Has also been used to describe the greatness of Allah.
762320	763640	But that's the secondary meaning.
763640	767280	The really the first meaning is we never think or say something about Allah
767560	769040	that is less than perfect of him.
769040	770680	OK. Now.
772080	774440	It says you sabbihu li-llahi.
775080	775920	Lil-lahi.
776800	781200	The laam, if you hear the li before Allah, you can say in Arabic you sabbihu
781200	783440	l-llahi. Perfectly good Arabic.
783440	784440	You sabbihu l-llahi.
785120	790280	OK. Like and what you sabbihu hu buqratan wa asila.
790280	791760	We don't say to sabbihu lahu.
791960	793040	We say to sabbihu hu.
793320	797120	So the laam, even if you don't hear it, it's still correct Arabic.
797840	799280	So then what's the laam doing there?
799280	800640	It creates two meanings.
801400	805280	What it creates the meaning tisbiha dan of Allah.
806000	810280	Meaning whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is in fact doing
810480	811920	declaring Allah's perfection.
812760	814720	But the laam can also be ta'diya.
814720	815920	It creates a new meaning.
815920	816720	What does that mean?
817160	823800	Everything in the skies in the earth declares perfection of Allah for Allah.
824280	826320	Now, why is that important oven for?
826320	827520	What difference does it make?
827520	831720	The difference it makes is if I do something for someone,
832720	837040	if I did something for you, then I'm describing my intentions.
838040	840840	If I did something to you, I'm describing my action.
841320	846400	But if I just say I did something for you, then I'm describing my intention.
846960	850240	And if I say it was for you, that means I was sincere to you.
850800	854320	If the universe is doing tisbiha for Allah,
854800	857480	that means the universe is not being forced to do it.
857720	860640	They're genuinely doing it out of sincere intention.
861040	864360	Every creation Allah made that Allah made in its nature
864640	869360	actually recognizes how perfect Allah is and genuinely does tisbiha.
870160	871560	It's not being forced to do it.
871560	873680	Allah didn't force it to do tisbiha.
874200	876400	Allah is not tyrannical over his creation.
877040	879600	Everything, and that's why we find in the Qur'an,
879600	880840	itiyataw'an,
880840	881680	auqarhan,
881680	883320	qalata'atayna ta'ayn,
883320	885840	when Allah created the skies in the earth, he said to them,
886120	888720	you want to surrender willingly or unwillingly?
889240	891160	You want to be forced or do you want to be willing?
891160	893200	And they said, we surrender willingly.
893680	895840	So this willing tisbiha, Allah,
896000	900560	means that all of creation does a sincere praise of Allah.
900800	903040	They're not, you know, atheists like to argue,
903200	905120	why does your God like praise so much?
905120	905960	Why is he so?
905960	908320	And they use words like, why is he so narcissistic?
908560	910120	Why is he so self-centered?
910120	913920	Because whatever diagnosis they have of themselves,
914080	916840	they put that on to God because they have God complex themselves.
916840	918000	So they put that on to God.
918000	921000	And our response, first response, there's many responses to that.
921000	922920	But one of them is actually nothing praises him.
923280	924400	Because he demanded it.
925440	928200	Everything praises him because once they recognize him,
928200	930440	they have, they become compelled to do it on their own.
931440	933880	Just by the recognition of who he is,
934760	939040	which then leads to other, I told you, in some surahs,
939320	942800	there are, and by the way, one more thing about the tisbiha for Allah,
943000	944760	that refers to sincerity, right?
945560	950560	And these surahs will have one subject that came through all ten of these surahs.
950560	951480	What was it? You know?
952360	953200	Hypocrisy.
953840	957400	Hypocrisy and hypocrites have one major problem, which is what?
958000	960120	Sincerity, right?
960120	964200	So the very beginning phrase actually embeds sincerity
964360	967480	because that's going to be a problem that Allah is going to address
967480	968520	throughout these surahs.
968520	973840	OK, now, when tisbiha has mentioned in the past,
973840	976520	like everything has declared the perfection of Allah,
976800	979240	everything has been declaring the perfection of Allah.
979680	983720	It's as if Allah is saying this is an ancient truth and you're late.
984600	986880	Like this has been going on long before you even existed.
986880	988280	Everything was doing tisbiha.
988280	991360	Why do you think that if you don't do it, it's not going to happen?
992120	993120	Oh, it's been happening.
993120	994520	It's a lot bigger than you.
994520	995920	It's a lot older than you.
995920	1000720	And the universe is just the universe we know is just the first sky,
1000720	1007240	the 13.9 billion light year old universe that we know is just the first sky.
1007360	1010680	And then there's the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh skies,
1011160	1013080	whose ages we can't even imagine.
1013080	1015040	And all of them have been doing what?
1015880	1022280	This be. So just imagine the volume of this be compared to even the earth's tisbiha.
1022640	1028120	And then within the earth, imagine the volume of this be that I do in one life span.
1028880	1034040	It's you can't even put the number of zeros you would have to put before you put the one
1034600	1040600	on the percentage of how much might this be counts in the existence of this be is so miniscule.
1040840	1045280	And the ages for which it has been going on is so large that it humbles me.
1045400	1050600	And it makes me realize me praising Allah doesn't benefit Allah in any way,
1050600	1055680	doesn't add to Allah in any way, doesn't secure Allah in any way, doesn't make him feel.
1055680	1057520	But human beings need praise.
1057520	1060240	Human beings need, you know, redemption.
1060400	1066640	Human beings need likes and heart emojis and fire emojis under their post.
1067360	1068040	They need that.
1068040	1072440	You know, Allah doesn't need acknowledgement for his acknowledgement to exist.
1072440	1074040	It's always existed.
1074040	1078800	And so that so you're and also, of course, I put here, you're not being asked of something new.
1079040	1080920	It's not like, why is Allah asking me this?
1082000	1083680	No, he's not asking you of this.
1083680	1088720	This is actually something that's existed much before you and in your very nature.
1088720	1090200	You're denying your own nature.
1090280	1094000	But this surah is about this be in the present and also the future.
1094760	1097080	What does the present actually tells you is this be?
1097280	1099840	Whether I do it or not, it's happening all around me.
1100720	1102640	It's actually already happening all around me.
1103000	1105160	In fact, it's even happening within my own body.
1105160	1107200	My blood cells are doing this be right now.
1107560	1109280	My skin cells are doing this be right now.
1109280	1111160	My nails are doing this be right now.
1111160	1112920	My heart is doing this be right now.
1114080	1117720	The way I describe this in surah hadid, I'm going to describe it the same way to you guys.
1118320	1121360	I want you to know that Allah is in control of everything, right?
1122040	1126920	But what he did for human beings is he also put most of our life out of our control.
1127440	1128800	Where was I going to be born?
1128800	1130240	Was that under my control?
1130240	1131080	Where am I going to die?
1131080	1132320	Is that under my control?
1132320	1134240	My genetics are they under my control?
1134240	1139760	My height, my skin color, my brain capacity, my thought process.
1140240	1141760	So was that under my?
1141760	1143240	Did I decide?
1143240	1144400	Did I have any say in that?
1144400	1146440	No, I don't have any say in that.
1146480	1148640	What people will come in my life?
1149240	1151160	What? What am I going to be allergic to?
1151840	1152680	What am I going to be?
1152680	1155120	What am I going to have a bad reaction to?
1155120	1157360	What sicknesses am I going to fall under?
1157560	1160200	What car will come hit me if I'm driving on the road?
1160560	1162360	None of this is under my control.
1162360	1163080	You understand?
1163080	1167960	Like there's so much most of my life is actually not under my control at all.
1168680	1170960	My list is not written by me.
1170960	1173640	It's written by Allah, Aziz and will that the three
1173880	1176440	of us will be able to decide where I'm going to die.
1176800	1178680	Nobody knows where they're going to die.
1178680	1183200	Right. I didn't decide who my siblings are, who my cousins are, who my parents are.
1183440	1186200	If you guys had a choice to choose who your siblings are going to be,
1186480	1188280	we'd be in very different families.
1188280	1189160	Some of us, right?
1189160	1191080	So the idea is not me.
1191080	1192000	I'm happy with my siblings.
1192000	1197880	But anyway, so you have then then Allah created a very, very small circle.
1199280	1203600	Little tightly think of it like a fence, small little fence inside me.
1203840	1205800	And in that fence, he gave me some freedom.
1207120	1210280	So he didn't give me the freedom to live outside this body.
1211200	1214200	He didn't give me the freedom to live outside my lifespan or which century
1214200	1215040	should I be born in?
1215040	1217160	He didn't give me any of those freedoms.
1217160	1220760	But within this small circle, he gave me the freedom to choose right from wrong.
1220760	1222280	That's it.
1222280	1224840	That's that's he did give me that freedom.
1224840	1227320	He gave me some operational freedom over my body.
1227480	1228960	Should I raise this hand or put it down?
1228960	1230960	He gave me that freedom.
1230960	1233360	You know, I don't say Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala.
1233400	1234240	Just raise this hand.
1234240	1235840	No, no, he gave me the freedom to raise this hand.
1235840	1240560	He created this fence and inside that fence I can operate outside of it.
1240880	1244080	Everything he got complete control over it.
1244200	1245360	You understand?
1245360	1247360	No.
1247360	1251000	The things that are not under my control, like my blood flowing through my veins,
1251560	1253440	my heart beating, is that under my control right now?
1254040	1254880	No.
1254880	1256200	What is it?
1256200	1258640	Those things are doing to speak of Allah.
1258640	1260960	But that little circle in which I have choice.
1261960	1263560	That little circle.
1263560	1266960	In that circle, I choose not to do this bihafullah.
1267640	1268880	Sometimes.
1268880	1270720	Or not the way I should.
1270720	1272320	Not the way I should.
1272320	1278040	But that doesn't change the fact that everything around me and most of even me is actually still doing what?
1278840	1281920	This way even the atheist's heart is doing this bihafullah.
1283160	1286680	Even his heart, even his brain cells, every neuron that fires is doing this bihafullah.
1286760	1290200	The tongue that curses God is doing this bihafullah.
1290360	1292680	And that's why that tongue on judgment day is going to say,
1293240	1294320	Yeah, you made me do that.
1294320	1296160	But now Allah allowed me to.
1296720	1299440	Allah handed you the controller over this thing.
1299800	1303520	But today, the hand, the feet, everything starts speaking on judgment day.
1304000	1305880	That were already under Allah's command.
1305880	1307760	They were already doing this bihafullah.
1307760	1309560	You were the one forcing them to rebel.
1309560	1310160	So they say,
1312200	1316120	The one who makes everything speak today is making us speak.
1317400	1327160	So the way I describe even our bodies is like I used to watch a lot of Gundam anime stuff when I was younger.
1327840	1331560	Some of you might know or I don't know if you're more lame than you watch Power Rangers.
1331560	1332720	I don't know.
1332720	1337720	But you're underneath a gigantic robot and you're controlling it.
1338560	1339360	Right.
1339360	1342400	So Allah has handed you the controls over this body.
1342400	1343760	This body is not me.
1343760	1346160	This is just a robot.
1346960	1349000	That I've been given control over.
1349000	1352360	And then one day will come and I will lose control over this machine.
1352360	1354600	This machine will be taken away from me.
1354600	1357920	And then when it's regenerated, it will not be under my control.
1358640	1360640	Muhti'ina muknii r'uusim.
1360640	1365720	Allah says judgment day disbelievers are going to be staring straight at their punishment and running towards it.
1367160	1370280	The natural thing is if you see danger, first of all, you don't look at it.
1371080	1373040	And second of all, if you do see it, what do you do?
1374000	1374920	You run the other way.
1374960	1379520	Judgment day Allah describes people that disbelieve are looking at the fire, looking at the punishment,
1379520	1382840	and their heads are staring and they can't blink and they're running straight towards it.
1382840	1383560	What does that tell you?
1383560	1384840	Their bodies are no longer what?
1385960	1387560	There's no longer under their control.
1387560	1390480	The guy is being handed his book on his left hand behind his back.
1391320	1393560	He no longer has the power to what?
1393560	1394960	How bad is it?
1394960	1396040	He can't.
1396040	1398720	It's behind his back, on his left side.
1398720	1401120	He can't do it because the control has been taken away.
1401120	1403600	But right now we have limited control.
1403640	1406960	Anyway, so it's happening all around you and you're missing out.
1406960	1410480	When Allah says everything is already doing this, we have Allah and will continue to do so.
1410880	1419360	Actually, you should make you feel like maybe I should join that group, that part.
1419360	1420760	The rest of the universe is on board.
1420760	1422760	I'm the only one missing out.
1422760	1425160	This is called Qina'ya.
1425160	1426960	And Qina'ya is a big part of Quran.
1426960	1428360	Let me tell you what Qina'ya is.
1428360	1430280	Nowadays, people say this on TikTok.
1430280	1432200	Tell me something without telling me something.
1433960	1434480	Right?
1434480	1436480	That's Qina'ya.
1437280	1438200	Qina'ya means...
1440040	1442880	So, for example, if I say right now,
1443520	1444720	oh, it's kind of hot in here.
1444720	1446320	It's much better now because the doors are open.
1446320	1450800	But like, if I said it's kind of hot in here and the organizer said,
1451200	1451960	yes, it is.
1452040	1452920	Yes, it is.
1454080	1454840	Good observation.
1456880	1458080	You're not getting my Qina'ya.
1458600	1460760	I was saying, can we make it cooler?
1460920	1461800	But I didn't say that.
1461800	1462600	I just said what?
1463600	1464200	It's getting hot.
1464880	1468160	Or you come home and your child is there and you come home, you sit down,
1468160	1470400	you say, oh, I'm thirsty.
1472040	1475600	And your son looks at you and says, yeah, it makes sense.
1475600	1476320	You had a long day.
1477720	1478440	It's hot outside.
1480120	1481600	I said, I'm thirsty.
1481880	1483600	And he says, I heard you.
1484920	1486120	And it makes sense.
1488040	1490240	I can see what Qina'ya means.
1491520	1492680	Go run and get the water.
1493600	1494440	But you're not going to say that.
1494440	1496360	You're just going to say, I'm thirsty.
1496360	1500920	When Allah says everything in the skies and everything in the earth is doing
1500920	1502800	this, be and will keep doing this, be.
1503400	1504320	And you look, listen to that.
1504320	1505360	I said, that's so cool.
1507600	1508320	That's really cool.
1508320	1511880	Everything's doing this, be stupid.
1512080	1514960	It's telling you, do this, be.
1516800	1517720	That's called what?
1518640	1519000	Qina'ya.
1519000	1521720	When you study Quran, you have to keep an eye open for Qina'ya.
1522640	1522880	Okay.
1522880	1527000	This is, Allah is telling you something in between the lines and it doesn't
1527000	1529880	take a genius to understand that that's what's being said.
1530120	1530400	Okay.
1531360	1534360	Also, because the present and future is being mentioned, they will continue to do
1534360	1538880	this, be as if to say, I'm not going to be around forever.
1539960	1542480	I'm here for a little bit and I'm going to be gone.
1542480	1546440	But to this be how the law will remain, it will go on forever.
1547080	1549040	And so it and it's hinting at the future.
1549040	1551320	There's another, there's a subtle in the surahs.
1551560	1556680	Where the tasbih is mentioned in the future tense, something in the surah is
1556680	1560240	coming that's going to tie into the future.
1560920	1563920	Because the tasbih is also mentioned in the future.
1563920	1566200	So we're going to keep an eye open for that when we study surahs.
1567000	1570200	Because the tasbih is hinting towards the future.
1570400	1570680	Right.
1570680	1572720	So we'll see how that manifests itself.
1576720	1580520	Here's what's coming up in the next episode and this deeper look of surahs.
1581600	1585280	But then comes a much more difficult question.
1585800	1589600	If creation is imperfect, by the way, am I perfect?
1589640	1590640	No, are you perfect?
1590640	1591000	No.
1591880	1594240	Is anything in the world perfect actually?
1594280	1597160	No, the only one who's perfect is who is Allah.
1597160	1599680	So now here's the here's the problem is the philosophical problem.
1600000	1604200	The problem is if I see a beautiful painting, I say the artist is creative.
1605840	1609800	But then how could I see something imperfect and then say the maker is.
1610800	1611400	Perfect.
1612000	1614080	How can it's how can I say that it's perfect?
1614080	1618120	Because we're saying everything declares how perfect Allah is.
1618560	1620560	But everything itself is not perfect.
1620920	1624280	So how is it an evidence that the maker of it is perfect?
1624280	1627240	This is by the way, a very common atheist argument.
1627320	1628520	Oh, your God is so perfect.
1629880	1631000	What about cockroaches?
1633120	1635000	What about a rash on your skin?
1635680	1636560	What about my cousin?
1637560	1643560	Like God is so perfect.
1645240	1646920	The point is actually.
