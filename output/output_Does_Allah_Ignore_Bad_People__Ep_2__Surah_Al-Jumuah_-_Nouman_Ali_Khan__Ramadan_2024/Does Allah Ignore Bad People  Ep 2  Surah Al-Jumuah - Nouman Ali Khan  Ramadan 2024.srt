1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Or as if Allah doesn't know what's really going on. This is important. We say it's easy to say Allah knows everything

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,160
easy to say

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,660
And then people say Assad, you know some people they do really bad things, but they don't look like they get punished

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,800
Like how come why why is Allah doing that?

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,160
And then you're like yeah, but what Allah is gonna like punish them on judgment day or what? Oh

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,120
So he has to explain to you what he's gonna do

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,760
This is how this works

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,000
Because when judgment day begins and everybody's about to be judged you're like hold on a lot

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,680
I just want to make sure this guy who stole my ketchup from McDonald's

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Gets what he deserves

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,360
Now we may begin

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,660
Okay, we have this sense of entitlement that somehow Allah owes us an explanation

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,320
O makar Allah, who liyeq di aakum adal ghayb Allah says Allah does not is not going to be one to inform you of what he does in the unseen

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Why does he have to tell you?

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,400
I

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,900
Gaming

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,560
We're Bush about me with silly

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,560
And I'll see you in a minute.

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,600
Surah Al-Jumu'ah, which is typical of this group of Surahs, especially the

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,680
Musabihaat, meaning the Surahs that begin with the Tasbih of Allah, the five of

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:51,280
them in this group, are very deep and loaded beginnings. So my intention is to

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,080
try and finish our discussion on the first ayah today. It looks unlikely, but I'm

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,840
going to not rush through it. I want to be able to cover everything that I wanted

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,000
to share with you in some detail, inshaAllah, and see how we progress. Anyway,

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,240
so the first conversation I want to have with you is about the word Tasbih or

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,480
the word Yusam Bihul that occurs in the ayah. Once again, in an easy translation,

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,960
the first part of this ayah is, whatever is in the skies and whatever is in

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,400
the earth, does and will continue to do Tasbih of Allah, meaning declares and

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,840
will continue to declare the perfection of Allah. One of the most important

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,320
studies in the Quran is the study of words. So Arabic is really unique because

31
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,240
every word has an etymology and an entire story behind it. So I just said

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,760
declares the perfection of Allah. That's an easy English translation. But behind

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,000
this word is imagery. This word Tasbih comes from Saba'a and Saba'a has some

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,320
images associated with it. So as we will go through this series of lectures,

35
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,760
every time we come across a word, we're going to go look in the background of

36
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,040
that word. Where does word come from? How are the Arabs using the associated

37
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,440
words? And then how do we get to the meaning of the word that we're dealing

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,200
with in this ayah? Okay, so those secondary meanings, those background

39
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,560
meanings, they help us get a deep understanding of the word that Allah is

40
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,840
using. So let's start with Tasbih, which is coming from the letters,

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,880
Sain, Ba and Ha. Those are the root letters of this word, Saba'a. Saba'a. Siba'a

42
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,440
were actually unstitched, hide or leather garments. I couldn't find a better

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,960
picture than that. But anyway, ancient times babies had clothes, but they didn't

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,080
have any stitching on the side. You just stick the arms in and the neck in and it

45
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,240
just flows, right? So it doesn't, you can't tell if the baby's fat or skinny

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:53,120
because it's all just kind of flowing. So that, which doesn't stick to the body,

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,680
right? Doesn't contour to the body. Those kinds of clothes were called Siba'a. It

48
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,000
also means to be stretched or extended out. Tasbih is used when you're stretching

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,440
leather. That's actually called Tasbih or stretching a string or a rope or

50
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,480
something like that. So so far we got the meaning of something that doesn't, you

51
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,680
know, dip down into the shape of the body and something that's stretched out,

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:25,080
leveled out. Then Tasbih is actually when you swim and you don't go underwater. So

53
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,520
you're swimming, but you stay above the water the whole time. If you go under the

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,880
water and you come up, that's called Al-Aun. It's a different word for swimming.

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,280
But Saba'a is actually, or Saba'a the verb is actually when you, when you don't

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,040
dip at all, you stay above. So now we've got this idea, this concept of something

57
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,000
stretched out like a straight line, something that doesn't dip into the body

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,520
of the child, and even a swimmer that doesn't dip under the water. He maintains

59
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,760
or she maintains the level. Fara Siba'a, Saba'a, a horse was described as Saba'a

60
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,480
that extends its legs out as far as it can. So when it gallops, it stretches its

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,440
legs out. So it's called Hasanu Mad-din-yadain-fil-jari, meaning it extends

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,840
as far as it can when it runs. So being extended and engaged without being

63
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,200
immersed. Likewise, like the swimmer who won't submerge, meaning the swimmer that

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,040
won't go down, the child's loose garment doesn't contour to the body and

65
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,120
thus doesn't immerse into the form of the child. That's why outer garments are

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,680
called Qisa'a Musab'ah, meaning spread out. Thus, constant activity with no

67
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,560
downtime. This is interesting. If you're working, working, working and you never

68
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,400
take a break, like the swimmer who never goes under the water, that's actually

69
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,760
called Saba'ah. And it's used for the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

70
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,000
when Allah says, Inna Laka'a Finna Haari, Saba'a An Taweela. You have long,

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,160
endless, breakless, you know, seamless tasks work to do where you're not going

72
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,800
to get any breaks. And that's called Saba'ah, maintaining. From this came the

73
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,120
idea of not being brought down in any way. In other words, I'm not going to say

74
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,440
anything about Allah that brings down His perfection. So the idea of this

75
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,480
be is maintaining or floating our concept of Allah and not letting it drown

76
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,320
even a little bit, or not letting it weaken even a little bit in any way,

77
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,680
right? So the way that the scholars talked about this, for example, what

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,840
doesn't be fit His Majesty's perfection. But some of it has to do with being

79
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:44,600
declared perfect. Meaning that you say something that is not appropriate for

80
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:53,040
Him, whether it's a partner or a child, or if you say Allah made

81
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,400
something without a purpose. By the way, that's philosophically all. Allah says

82
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,240
He created the skies and the earth with purpose. You know what that means? That

83
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,160
He created me with a purpose. But it also means every situation He created, He

84
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,280
also created with a purpose. Every disadvantage in my life was for a

85
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,520
purpose. Every advantage of my life was for a purpose. Every test was for a

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,960
purpose. You know, every ability and every disability was for a purpose. And the

87
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,360
moment I start thinking, I don't see the point why Allah did this, I pretty

88
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,160
look pretty purposeless to me that this be of Allah is going away. Because Allah

89
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,480
never does something without purpose, right? So that's important. Now,

90
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,920
An Yorab el-Basar, that He can be seen, you know, like I used to have a co-worker

91
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,960
back in New York when I was in college in 1864. And she told me, hey, you're

92
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,440
religious, right? I was like, a little bit. And she said, I saw God in my dream

93
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,280
last night. I was like, no, you didn't. It's like, no, I did. I was like, no,

94
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,600
that was the devil. That was the devil. It wasn't a, she said, then she said, he

95
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,080
looked like you. I was like, that was definitely the devil. Definitely the

96
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,800
devil. Okay.

97
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
And ta'alama mulaika tuhum ma'alami ya'alimhum. Or you know, saying something

98
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,680
like, you know, the angels saying that, you know, how can we know something you

99
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,960
didn't teach us? Even the angels claiming I could even know something that you

100
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,840
didn't teach us. This is subhanaka la'ilbalana illama alamtana. How perfect you

101
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,240
are. How can we know anything that you didn't teach us? Right? So even me

102
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,120
thinking I know something that didn't actually, you know, my knowledge, my

103
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,200
experience, my skill somehow came from somewhere other than Allah. Right? That's

104
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,040
also taking away from perfection of Allah. An yakhfa aleyhi makru shar. Or as if

105
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,920
Allah doesn't know what's really going on. This is important. We say it's easy

106
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,440
to say Allah knows everything. Easy to say. But then people are like, and we

107
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,120
easy to say Allah is fair. Allah is just. And then people say, Assad, you know,

108
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,840
some people, they do really bad things, but they don't look like they get

109
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,760
punished. Like, how come? Why? Why is all the doing that? Like, doesn't he know

110
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,560
that they did something bad? I'm like, do you know what you're saying? Who are

111
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,800
you talking about here? You're talking about Allah? And you're saying, doesn't

112
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,920
he know you don't know the answer to that question? You don't already know that

113
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,960
he knows? And then you're like, yeah, but what? Allah is going to like punish them

114
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,200
on judgment day or what? Oh, so he has to explain to you what he's going to do.

115
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,720
This is how this works. Because when judgment day begins and everybody's

116
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,760
about to be judged, you're like, hold on a lot. I just want to make sure this guy

117
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,560
who stole my ketchup from McDonald's gets what he deserves. Now we may begin.

118
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,800
We have this sense of entitlement that somehow Allah owes us an explanation.

119
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:03,520
Allah says, Allah is not going to be one to inform you of what he does in the unseen.

120
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,080
Why does he have to tell you? And you know, there's this disease that we have now

121
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,040
that, you know, things happen in my life, things happen in your life. And people

122
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,600
really question Allah. Why did that happen? Why did that happen to me? Right? And

123
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,280
then they say, my faith is in crisis until Allah reveals to me the secret behind

124
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,880
why this happened to me. Until I know why this happened to me. I don't know. I

125
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,760
don't know if I can trust Allah because I don't see the logic in it. He needs to

126
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,600
convince me of his logic before I can move on. This is the height of arrogance.

127
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,040
And it's all we don't. It's our dissatisfaction will be allow it to turn

128
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,000
into arrogance. Arrabbu Rabb, the master is the master. He doesn't owe me an

129
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,600
explanation. I have to humble myself before him. You know, I was when I was

130
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,960
teaching through the Dariyat. Ibrahim, alaihi salam's wife was very old. You

131
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,840
know that, right? And Allah sent the angels and what did the angels tell her?

132
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,840
You're going to have a baby. She could have been like, oh, yeah, now.

133
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:14,760
Well, I was 20, I was 21, 22, 30, 40. You want to come tell me I'm going to

134
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,880
have a baby when I can't even sit down without my bones cracking? Now I'm

135
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,000
going to have a baby. This is this is wisdom. This is what wisdom looks like.

136
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,880
This is the last plan. Huh?

137
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,400
She could have done that. Yes or no?

138
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,440
Because can she see the logic in it? No.

139
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
Can anybody see the logic in it? No.

140
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,520
All these years I'm living in depression because I can't give you.

141
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,200
Ibrahim, alaihi salam, a child.

142
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,320
And now, now when I'm probably going to die before he gets old, now you're going

143
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,680
to give me a child. What does the angel say there?

144
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
God, I keep calling Rambuki.

145
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,960
Inna hu hu al hakeemun Ali.

146
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,920
This is what you're this is exactly how your master said it.

147
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,840
We're just delivering the news.

148
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,120
I didn't come up with the policy. I'm here to deliver the package.

149
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
Just this one.

150
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,920
Qadali ki qadar Rambuki.

151
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,720
He has all the wisdom and he knows.

152
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,560
Meaning you need to trust what?

153
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,640
The wisdom of Allah. The wisdom of Allah is perfect.

154
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,240
The knowledge of Allah is perfect.

155
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,040
It's not like he didn't know my situation and then he made this decision or he

156
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,280
didn't consider everything before he made a decision.

157
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,160
He makes a decision knowing everything.

158
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,800
I'm the one who has lack in knowledge, not him.

159
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,320
I'm the one who has lack in wisdom, not him.

160
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,400
This is part of the tisbiha of Allah.

161
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,680
The absolute flawless nature of his lordship.

162
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,160
So the word tisbiha and we'll dive into this a little bit more.

163
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,320
Has also been used to describe the greatness of Allah.

164
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,640
But that's the secondary meaning.

165
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,280
The really the first meaning is we never think or say something about Allah

166
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,040
that is less than perfect of him.

167
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,680
OK. Now.

168
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,440
It says you sabbihu li-llahi.

169
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,920
Lil-lahi.

170
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,200
The laam, if you hear the li before Allah, you can say in Arabic you sabbihu

171
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
l-llahi. Perfectly good Arabic.

172
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
You sabbihu l-llahi.

173
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,280
OK. Like and what you sabbihu hu buqratan wa asila.

174
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,760
We don't say to sabbihu lahu.

175
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,040
We say to sabbihu hu.

176
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,120
So the laam, even if you don't hear it, it's still correct Arabic.

177
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,280
So then what's the laam doing there?

178
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,640
It creates two meanings.

179
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,280
What it creates the meaning tisbiha dan of Allah.

180
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,280
Meaning whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is in fact doing

181
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
declaring Allah's perfection.

182
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,720
But the laam can also be ta'diya.

183
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
It creates a new meaning.

184
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,720
What does that mean?

185
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,800
Everything in the skies in the earth declares perfection of Allah for Allah.

186
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,320
Now, why is that important oven for?

187
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,520
What difference does it make?

188
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,720
The difference it makes is if I do something for someone,

189
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
if I did something for you, then I'm describing my intentions.

190
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,840
If I did something to you, I'm describing my action.

191
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,400
But if I just say I did something for you, then I'm describing my intention.

192
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,240
And if I say it was for you, that means I was sincere to you.

193
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,320
If the universe is doing tisbiha for Allah,

194
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,480
that means the universe is not being forced to do it.

195
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,640
They're genuinely doing it out of sincere intention.

196
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,360
Every creation Allah made that Allah made in its nature

197
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,360
actually recognizes how perfect Allah is and genuinely does tisbiha.

198
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,560
It's not being forced to do it.

199
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,680
Allah didn't force it to do tisbiha.

200
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,400
Allah is not tyrannical over his creation.

201
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,600
Everything, and that's why we find in the Qur'an,

202
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,840
itiyataw'an,

203
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,680
auqarhan,

204
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,320
qalata'atayna ta'ayn,

205
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,840
when Allah created the skies in the earth, he said to them,

206
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,720
you want to surrender willingly or unwillingly?

207
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,160
You want to be forced or do you want to be willing?

208
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,200
And they said, we surrender willingly.

209
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,840
So this willing tisbiha, Allah,

210
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,560
means that all of creation does a sincere praise of Allah.

211
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
They're not, you know, atheists like to argue,

212
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,120
why does your God like praise so much?

213
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,960
Why is he so?

214
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,320
And they use words like, why is he so narcissistic?

215
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,120
Why is he so self-centered?

216
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,920
Because whatever diagnosis they have of themselves,

217
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,840
they put that on to God because they have God complex themselves.

218
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,000
So they put that on to God.

219
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And our response, first response, there's many responses to that.

220
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,920
But one of them is actually nothing praises him.

221
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,400
Because he demanded it.

222
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,200
Everything praises him because once they recognize him,

223
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,440
they have, they become compelled to do it on their own.

224
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,880
Just by the recognition of who he is,

225
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,040
which then leads to other, I told you, in some surahs,

226
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,800
there are, and by the way, one more thing about the tisbiha for Allah,

227
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,760
that refers to sincerity, right?

228
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,560
And these surahs will have one subject that came through all ten of these surahs.

229
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
What was it? You know?

230
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,200
Hypocrisy.

231
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,400
Hypocrisy and hypocrites have one major problem, which is what?

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,120
Sincerity, right?

233
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,200
So the very beginning phrase actually embeds sincerity

234
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,480
because that's going to be a problem that Allah is going to address

235
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,520
throughout these surahs.

236
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,840
OK, now, when tisbiha has mentioned in the past,

237
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,520
like everything has declared the perfection of Allah,

238
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,240
everything has been declaring the perfection of Allah.

239
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,720
It's as if Allah is saying this is an ancient truth and you're late.

240
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,880
Like this has been going on long before you even existed.

241
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,280
Everything was doing tisbiha.

242
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,360
Why do you think that if you don't do it, it's not going to happen?

243
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Oh, it's been happening.

244
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
It's a lot bigger than you.

245
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,920
It's a lot older than you.

246
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,720
And the universe is just the universe we know is just the first sky,

247
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,240
the 13.9 billion light year old universe that we know is just the first sky.

248
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,680
And then there's the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh skies,

249
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,080
whose ages we can't even imagine.

250
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,040
And all of them have been doing what?

251
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:02,280
This be. So just imagine the volume of this be compared to even the earth's tisbiha.

252
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,120
And then within the earth, imagine the volume of this be that I do in one life span.

253
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,040
It's you can't even put the number of zeros you would have to put before you put the one

254
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,600
on the percentage of how much might this be counts in the existence of this be is so miniscule.

255
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,280
And the ages for which it has been going on is so large that it humbles me.

256
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,600
And it makes me realize me praising Allah doesn't benefit Allah in any way,

257
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,680
doesn't add to Allah in any way, doesn't secure Allah in any way, doesn't make him feel.

258
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,520
But human beings need praise.

259
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,240
Human beings need, you know, redemption.

260
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,640
Human beings need likes and heart emojis and fire emojis under their post.

261
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,040
They need that.

262
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,440
You know, Allah doesn't need acknowledgement for his acknowledgement to exist.

263
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,040
It's always existed.

264
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,800
And so that so you're and also, of course, I put here, you're not being asked of something new.

265
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,920
It's not like, why is Allah asking me this?

266
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,680
No, he's not asking you of this.

267
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,720
This is actually something that's existed much before you and in your very nature.

268
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,200
You're denying your own nature.

269
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,000
But this surah is about this be in the present and also the future.

270
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,080
What does the present actually tells you is this be?

271
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,840
Whether I do it or not, it's happening all around me.

272
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,640
It's actually already happening all around me.

273
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,160
In fact, it's even happening within my own body.

274
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,200
My blood cells are doing this be right now.

275
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,280
My skin cells are doing this be right now.

276
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,160
My nails are doing this be right now.

277
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,920
My heart is doing this be right now.

278
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,720
The way I describe this in surah hadid, I'm going to describe it the same way to you guys.

279
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,360
I want you to know that Allah is in control of everything, right?

280
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,920
But what he did for human beings is he also put most of our life out of our control.

281
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,800
Where was I going to be born?

282
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,240
Was that under my control?

283
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,080
Where am I going to die?

284
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,320
Is that under my control?

285
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,240
My genetics are they under my control?

286
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,760
My height, my skin color, my brain capacity, my thought process.

287
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,760
So was that under my?

288
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,240
Did I decide?

289
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,400
Did I have any say in that?

290
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,440
No, I don't have any say in that.

291
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
What people will come in my life?

292
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,160
What? What am I going to be allergic to?

293
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,680
What am I going to be?

294
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,120
What am I going to have a bad reaction to?

295
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,360
What sicknesses am I going to fall under?

296
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,200
What car will come hit me if I'm driving on the road?

297
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,360
None of this is under my control.

298
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,080
You understand?

299
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,960
Like there's so much most of my life is actually not under my control at all.

300
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,960
My list is not written by me.

301
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,640
It's written by Allah, Aziz and will that the three

302
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,440
of us will be able to decide where I'm going to die.

303
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,680
Nobody knows where they're going to die.

304
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,200
Right. I didn't decide who my siblings are, who my cousins are, who my parents are.

305
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,200
If you guys had a choice to choose who your siblings are going to be,

306
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,280
we'd be in very different families.

307
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,160
Some of us, right?

308
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,080
So the idea is not me.

309
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm happy with my siblings.

310
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,880
But anyway, so you have then then Allah created a very, very small circle.

311
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,600
Little tightly think of it like a fence, small little fence inside me.

312
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,800
And in that fence, he gave me some freedom.

313
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,280
So he didn't give me the freedom to live outside this body.

314
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
He didn't give me the freedom to live outside my lifespan or which century

315
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,040
should I be born in?

316
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,160
He didn't give me any of those freedoms.

317
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,760
But within this small circle, he gave me the freedom to choose right from wrong.

318
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,280
That's it.

319
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,840
That's that's he did give me that freedom.

320
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,320
He gave me some operational freedom over my body.

321
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,960
Should I raise this hand or put it down?

322
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
He gave me that freedom.

323
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,360
You know, I don't say Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala.

324
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
Just raise this hand.

325
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
No, no, he gave me the freedom to raise this hand.

326
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,560
He created this fence and inside that fence I can operate outside of it.

327
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,080
Everything he got complete control over it.

328
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,360
You understand?

329
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
No.

330
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,000
The things that are not under my control, like my blood flowing through my veins,

331
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,440
my heart beating, is that under my control right now?

332
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,880
No.

333
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,200
What is it?

334
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,640
Those things are doing to speak of Allah.

335
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,960
But that little circle in which I have choice.

336
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,560
That little circle.

337
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,960
In that circle, I choose not to do this bihafullah.

338
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,880
Sometimes.

339
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,720
Or not the way I should.

340
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,320
Not the way I should.

341
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,040
But that doesn't change the fact that everything around me and most of even me is actually still doing what?

342
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,920
This way even the atheist's heart is doing this bihafullah.

343
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,680
Even his heart, even his brain cells, every neuron that fires is doing this bihafullah.

344
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,200
The tongue that curses God is doing this bihafullah.

345
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,680
And that's why that tongue on judgment day is going to say,

346
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,320
Yeah, you made me do that.

347
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,160
But now Allah allowed me to.

348
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,440
Allah handed you the controller over this thing.

349
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,520
But today, the hand, the feet, everything starts speaking on judgment day.

350
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,880
That were already under Allah's command.

351
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,760
They were already doing this bihafullah.

352
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
You were the one forcing them to rebel.

353
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,160
So they say,

354
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,120
The one who makes everything speak today is making us speak.

355
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:07,160
So the way I describe even our bodies is like I used to watch a lot of Gundam anime stuff when I was younger.

356
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,560
Some of you might know or I don't know if you're more lame than you watch Power Rangers.

357
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,720
I don't know.

358
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,720
But you're underneath a gigantic robot and you're controlling it.

359
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,360
Right.

360
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,400
So Allah has handed you the controls over this body.

361
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
This body is not me.

362
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,160
This is just a robot.

363
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,000
That I've been given control over.

364
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,360
And then one day will come and I will lose control over this machine.

365
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,600
This machine will be taken away from me.

366
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,920
And then when it's regenerated, it will not be under my control.

367
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Muhti'ina muknii r'uusim.

368
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,720
Allah says judgment day disbelievers are going to be staring straight at their punishment and running towards it.

369
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,280
The natural thing is if you see danger, first of all, you don't look at it.

370
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,040
And second of all, if you do see it, what do you do?

371
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,920
You run the other way.

372
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,520
Judgment day Allah describes people that disbelieve are looking at the fire, looking at the punishment,

373
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,840
and their heads are staring and they can't blink and they're running straight towards it.

374
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,560
What does that tell you?

375
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,840
Their bodies are no longer what?

376
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,560
There's no longer under their control.

377
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,480
The guy is being handed his book on his left hand behind his back.

378
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,560
He no longer has the power to what?

379
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,960
How bad is it?

380
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,040
He can't.

381
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,720
It's behind his back, on his left side.

382
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,120
He can't do it because the control has been taken away.

383
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,600
But right now we have limited control.

384
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,960
Anyway, so it's happening all around you and you're missing out.

385
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,480
When Allah says everything is already doing this, we have Allah and will continue to do so.

386
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:39,360
Actually, you should make you feel like maybe I should join that group, that part.

387
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,760
The rest of the universe is on board.

388
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
I'm the only one missing out.

389
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,160
This is called Qina'ya.

390
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,960
And Qina'ya is a big part of Quran.

391
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,360
Let me tell you what Qina'ya is.

392
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,280
Nowadays, people say this on TikTok.

393
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,200
Tell me something without telling me something.

394
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,480
Right?

395
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
That's Qina'ya.

396
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,200
Qina'ya means...

397
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,880
So, for example, if I say right now,

398
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,720
oh, it's kind of hot in here.

399
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
It's much better now because the doors are open.

400
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,800
But like, if I said it's kind of hot in here and the organizer said,

401
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,960
yes, it is.

402
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,920
Yes, it is.

403
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,840
Good observation.

404
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,080
You're not getting my Qina'ya.

405
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,760
I was saying, can we make it cooler?

406
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,800
But I didn't say that.

407
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,600
I just said what?

408
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,200
It's getting hot.

409
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,160
Or you come home and your child is there and you come home, you sit down,

410
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,400
you say, oh, I'm thirsty.

411
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,600
And your son looks at you and says, yeah, it makes sense.

412
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,320
You had a long day.

413
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,440
It's hot outside.

414
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,600
I said, I'm thirsty.

415
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,600
And he says, I heard you.

416
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,120
And it makes sense.

417
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,240
I can see what Qina'ya means.

418
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,680
Go run and get the water.

419
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
But you're not going to say that.

420
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,360
You're just going to say, I'm thirsty.

421
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,920
When Allah says everything in the skies and everything in the earth is doing

422
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,800
this, be and will keep doing this, be.

423
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,320
And you look, listen to that.

424
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,360
I said, that's so cool.

425
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,320
That's really cool.

426
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,880
Everything's doing this, be stupid.

427
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,960
It's telling you, do this, be.

428
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,720
That's called what?

429
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,000
Qina'ya.

430
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,720
When you study Quran, you have to keep an eye open for Qina'ya.

431
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:22,880
Okay.

432
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,000
This is, Allah is telling you something in between the lines and it doesn't

433
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,880
take a genius to understand that that's what's being said.

434
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,400
Okay.

435
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Also, because the present and future is being mentioned, they will continue to do

436
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,880
this, be as if to say, I'm not going to be around forever.

437
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,480
I'm here for a little bit and I'm going to be gone.

438
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,440
But to this be how the law will remain, it will go on forever.

439
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,040
And so it and it's hinting at the future.

440
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,320
There's another, there's a subtle in the surahs.

441
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,680
Where the tasbih is mentioned in the future tense, something in the surah is

442
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,240
coming that's going to tie into the future.

443
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Because the tasbih is also mentioned in the future.

444
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,200
So we're going to keep an eye open for that when we study surahs.

445
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,200
Because the tasbih is hinting towards the future.

446
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,680
Right.

447
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,720
So we'll see how that manifests itself.

448
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,520
Here's what's coming up in the next episode and this deeper look of surahs.

449
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,280
But then comes a much more difficult question.

450
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,600
If creation is imperfect, by the way, am I perfect?

451
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
No, are you perfect?

452
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,000
No.

453
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,240
Is anything in the world perfect actually?

454
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,160
No, the only one who's perfect is who is Allah.

455
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,680
So now here's the here's the problem is the philosophical problem.

456
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,200
The problem is if I see a beautiful painting, I say the artist is creative.

457
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,800
But then how could I see something imperfect and then say the maker is.

458
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,400
Perfect.

459
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
How can it's how can I say that it's perfect?

460
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,120
Because we're saying everything declares how perfect Allah is.

461
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
But everything itself is not perfect.

462
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,280
So how is it an evidence that the maker of it is perfect?

463
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,240
This is by the way, a very common atheist argument.

464
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,520
Oh, your God is so perfect.

465
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,000
What about cockroaches?

466
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,000
What about a rash on your skin?

467
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,560
What about my cousin?

468
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Like God is so perfect.

469
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,920
The point is actually.
