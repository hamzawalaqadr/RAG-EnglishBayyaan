1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Allah is so powerful he doesn't have to become visible in how he exerts his power

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,540
Lotiful limayasha, he's subtle in how he does things

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,680
Delicate in how he does things nearly unnoticed in how he does things

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,520
You know and some things is very obvious and some things is very delicate and invisible

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,280
And that's actually one of the great manifestations of the might of Allah

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,560
As-Salaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullah Wa Barakatuh

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,760
Bismillah wa Salatu wa Salamu Ala Rasulullah Wa Ala Aali wa Sahbihi Al-Juma'in

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,000
Ma ba'at fa a'oudu billahi bin al-Shaytan al-Rajim

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,160
Yusabbihu Lillahi Ma fis Samawati Wa Ma fis Al-Ardil Maliki Al-Quddus Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,160
Rabi Al-Shahli al-Sadri wa Yassili Amri

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,640
Wa Halu Al-Aukta Tam Billi Saniyya Fqahu Qawli

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,140
Amin Ya Rabbi Al-Alamin

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,180
Once again everyone, As-Salaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullah Wa Rahmatullah Wa Rahmatullah

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,780
We're gonna start talking about the name Al-Malik of Allah

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,220
So Allah is uniquely described himself in this Surah

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,580
On the opening ayah with four names Al-Malik Al-Quddus Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,820
Many places in the Quran Allah mentions two of his names together

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,940
Like Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem, Ghafurun Rahim, things like that, right?

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,340
So this Surah is unique because the opening has four names together

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,300
So that is a special feature of this Surah

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,300
So the first of those names is Al-Malik

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,420
It's used rarely in the Quran, it's not as common as you might think

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,100
But let's talk about a little bit of where the word Malik comes from

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,820
So the word Malik, or the verb Malika

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,780
Actually has to do with making something hard

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,140
Like you know when you make the dough and the bread

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,740
And the dough becomes tougher

29
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,140
That's actually Tamlik of the bread

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,220
From it also comes the idea of the Milak

31
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,940
Something is the foundation of a building

32
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,140
Or something that you build on top of

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,340
Madakut Tariq is the middle of the road

34
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,860
Meaning the most firm part of the road

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,660
Qawaimukulli Dabbatin Mulukuhu

36
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,100
The feet of an animal that it stands firm on

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,060
They're also called the Muluk of it

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,260
Meaning all of it has to do with firmness, toughness, stability

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,460
That sort of thing, these are the meanings in it

40
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,940
When you have control over something

41
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,780
That's called Malika Anshayt

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,620
Or you know command over something is a Malika

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,060
Malika Nafsahu to have control over yourself is Mulkuh Nafs

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,860
If you're able to control your emotions

45
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,860
Or if you're able to control your behavior

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,460
So these are the word keeps having to do with Kingdom

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,980
Or actually control and power and stability

48
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,100
These are the recurring themes inside of the word Mulk

49
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,940
Then comes the idea of when you hold something firm in your hand

50
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,980
Then you have Mulkuhu over it

51
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,020
So it's something firmly or grasping something firmly

52
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:55,780
So it's actually interestingly also used when a man is very possessive over his wife

53
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,660
Then they actually say Malika Al-Mar'a

54
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,180
It doesn't mean he owned the woman

55
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,380
It actually means he's very possessive over her

56
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,420
Or very dominating or controlling over her, etc

57
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,140
Now, how is this used for Allah in the Quran?

58
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,900
First of all in the Fatiha we have two readings Malik-e-Omiddin and Malik-e-Omiddin

59
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,540
So Malik and Malik are two different words

60
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,900
So let me help you understand them in easy language

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,740
Malik means owner

62
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,180
So I'm the Malik of this laptop

63
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,380
The Malik of this laptop

64
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,580
But I'm definitely not the Malik of this laptop

65
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,940
That would be a little bit dramatic of me

66
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,740
Because I am the owner of this laptop

67
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,780
But I'm definitely not the sovereign king ruler of this laptop

68
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,140
Okay, so you can own a car, you can own a pen, you can own a shirt

69
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,260
But you can't declare yourself the sovereign king of your t-shirt

70
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,580
It doesn't make sense

71
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,660
So the idea of kingdom is vast

72
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,980
The word Malik is used for vast territory

73
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,060
That you can be the king of an island

74
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,420
You can be the king of a country, king of an empire, etc

75
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,180
Right?

76
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,180
In America we use the king very little

77
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,340
This is the king of pizza

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,780
And this is the king of tires

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,100
Come to the Tire King for your special discount, etc

80
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,620
So they use these words king uselessly

81
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,380
But the idea of kingdom is actually a vast empire of some sense

82
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,140
Interestingly, a phrase in the Qur'an combines both of these concepts

83
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,300
Malik-e-Mulk

84
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,060
Qulillahumma, Malik-e-Mulk

85
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,420
Right?

86
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,340
Which is two different concepts

87
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,980
It actually means the owner of kingdom

88
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,260
So the word for ownership is milk

89
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,700
So it would be Malik-e-Mulk

90
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,220
Or Malik-e-Mulk

91
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,060
So one would be the owner of ownership

92
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,580
Or the king of kingdom

93
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,500
But Allah fused the two phrases together

94
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,900
He said Malik-e-Mulk, which means the owner of kingdom

95
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,700
So let's understand the difference between owner and king a little bit deeper

96
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,820
When I own something

97
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,020
Like if I own this machine

98
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,420
That I'm engaged with it

99
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm taking care of it

100
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,780
I have more direct access to it

101
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,020
But if I'm the king of a nation

102
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,620
Do I have control over everyone living under my nation?

103
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,100
No, because generally I have authority

104
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,740
But I don't have direct reach to everything that's under my kingdom

105
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,700
I have to have advisors, governors

106
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,540
Who have to have their own soldiers or their departments

107
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,700
And those departments have lieutenants and so on and so forth

108
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,260
Until you get to, for example

109
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,180
A government is at the top

110
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,700
You have the president or something

111
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,460
And the old days you have a king

112
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,020
And at the bottom you have somebody working at the post office

113
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,500
But the post office worker works for a department

114
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,740
Which answers to a department

115
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,860
Which answers to a department

116
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,060
And eventually goes up all the way to the ultimate authority

117
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,340
You understand?

118
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,660
But in that little department

119
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,540
He acts like he's the king and the post office guy

120
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,660
But the idea is that he's the Malik

121
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,380
Doesn't do direct engagement

122
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,300
But the Malik does

123
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,980
The Malik does direct engagement

124
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,780
Allah takes both of those names and fuses them together

125
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,500
When he says Malik al-Mulk

126
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,260
Another name of Allah is Malik in the Quran

127
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,700
في مقعد صدق عند مليك مقتد

128
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,460
Malik means the one who will always stay the king

129
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,780
It's a some sifah

130
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,940
So the one who will remain king forever

131
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,020
Because kingdoms

132
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,580
What comes in your mind when you think of kingdom?

133
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,860
Somebody inherited the kingdom

134
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,580
Or somebody usurped or took kingdom by force

135
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,180
That's how you get kingdom

136
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,620
And eventually that king whoever took it is going to get old

137
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,220
And he's going to either have a brother or a son

138
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,620
Or a younger son versus an older son

139
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,020
Some drama is going to happen

140
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,300
Right? And kingdom is going to get passed on

141
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,940
The king cannot hold on to the kingdom forever

142
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
Allah's name is also Malik

143
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,300
Which means the forever king

144
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,420
The forever king

145
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,220
That's one of Allah's names

146
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,420
Then the interesting thing about the word Malik

147
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,540
When it comes on its own

148
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,180
Al Malik

149
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,380
It's both times associated with

150
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,460
Two times associated with Al Qudus

151
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,740
The next name that's coming

152
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,820
Al Malik Al Qudus is here

153
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,180
Al Malik Al Qudus will also come in Sul'Tul HaShar

154
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,220
Okay? So

155
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,540
Al Malik Al Qudus is Salam al-Mu'min

156
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,660
Right there

157
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,180
And of course there's also the phrase

158
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,900
فَتَعَالَ اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقْ

159
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,580
Which means how high Allah is

160
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,100
The ultimately deserving king

161
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,820
The king who is the king who deserves to be the king

162
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,180
Also because when you think of kingship

163
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,420
You always sometimes think of a person who doesn't deserve it

164
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,620
Right? They don't truly deserve to be the king

165
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,660
They're the useless prince that became the king

166
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,060
Or these people they took over power

167
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,580
And they unjustifiably took over the kingdom

168
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,100
And therefore they became the king

169
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,460
But they're not the rightful king

170
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,460
You know so many movies you haven't seen because you're Islamic

171
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,100
Are about fights against the unrightful unjustified king

172
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,340
And the rightful king comes and wants to

173
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,940
Claim his you know make his claim on the throne

174
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,220
And there's a whatever drama happens right?

175
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,540
So the idea of Al Malik Al Haq is the rightful king

176
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,020
And Allah mentions over and over again in the Quran

177
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,060
لَهُ الْمُلْكُ

178
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,300
He owns all kingdom

179
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,660
He owns all kingdom

180
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,020
It's a very interesting concept

181
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,660
Allah himself is the king

182
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,460
But then he says he owns all kingdom

183
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,140
What's the difference between these two?

184
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,700
One is about Allah himself

185
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,340
He's the king

186
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,580
The other is every king that ever existed

187
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,500
Is actually owned by Allah

188
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,900
He owns all kingdom

189
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,300
Like he owns he decides when they live and when they die

190
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,100
Here they are thinking they decide when someone lives and someone dies

191
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,740
But actually Allah is deciding whether they live and whether they die

192
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
Which is why Allah says

193
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,380
لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَا اُلْحَمْ

194
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,580
يُحْيِي وَيُمِي

195
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,620
Like in the Hadid

196
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,460
لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَا الْسَمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ

197
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,740
يُحْيِي وَيُمِيْت

198
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
He owns the kingdom of the skies and the earth

199
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,100
He gives life and he gives death

200
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,700
You're distracting them

201
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,580
They're looking at you

202
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,740
There's so many people looking at you right now

203
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,660
It's like I wanted to look at you

204
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,900
That's what happens

205
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,660
Ha!

206
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,180
I keep an eye on you people

207
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,140
Okay anyway

208
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,700
Let's do this Allah

209
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,580
See I have no problem with awkward moments

210
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,620
I have this

211
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,460
It's okay

212
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,940
It's okay

213
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,180
It happens

214
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,340
It was one time I was giving a khutbah

215
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,580
This guy got a phone call

216
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,580
First row

217
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,700
Okay if you're gonna pick up your phone

218
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,380
At least be in the back row

219
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,140
He's in the first row

220
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,020
And you know some people when they get a call

221
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,660
Long distance call

222
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,900
They think it's still 1975

223
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,020
Where they have to talk extra loud

224
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,100
Cause you're going across the ocean

225
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,460
It's a WhatsApp call dude

226
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,900
Everybody gets the same message

227
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,260
Like it's not a different

228
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,420
Hello is everything okay?

229
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,300
Yeah

230
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,620
How's uncle?

231
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,500
Uncle's good

232
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,660
Yeah over and out

233
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,260
It's not a walkie talkie man

234
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,100
Saqqa al khutbah

235
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,300
The guy that started doing this

236
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
And I was like in the middle of the khutbah I was like

237
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,940
I just stopped my khutbah

238
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,620
I was like this is a really interesting conversation

239
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,420
Let me just finish

240
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,580
So he took a full 90 seconds

241
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,420
Finished this conversation

242
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,380
I was like is uncle okay?

243
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,140
He goes yeah it's okay

244
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,260
I was like okay

245
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,380
Okay

246
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,660
Anyway

247
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,860
So al-Medic actually has to do with rule

248
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
Ownership and control

249
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,660
Let's talk about these three concepts

250
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Rule ownership and control

251
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,540
Is it possible that you can have rule without ownership?

252
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,660
For example the government you live under has rule

253
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,740
But does it have ownership of your property?

254
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,700
It doesn't

255
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Right so there's some level of your own ownership

256
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,260
Even though somebody else has the rule

257
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,460
You have

258
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,780
And the flip can happen

259
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,900
You can have ownership but you don't have what?

260
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,940
Rule you have ownership over your car

261
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,540
But you don't have the rule over it to drive however you want

262
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,620
Okay

263
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,660
You can have ownership over your house

264
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,260
But there are rules in your neighborhood

265
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,900
And you cannot modify it however you want

266
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,420
You cannot make whatever changes you want

267
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,820
There are regulations in place

268
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,740
You have ownership but you don't have rule

269
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,820
So those two things can exist separately

270
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,620
You can also have rule without control

271
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,660
The government in the country can have rule

272
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
But does crime still happen?

273
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,100
Yeah so they have rule but they don't have control

274
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,900
Okay

275
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,940
Forget crime even in a government

276
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,060
There's a president, there's a vice president, there's a chancellor

277
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,740
There's whatever other roles

278
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,860
Does the president the higher level authority

279
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,260
Does he necessarily control the behaviors of everybody in his own office?

280
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,140
No

281
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,780
No

282
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,900
In fact forget government even in a business

283
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,620
If many of you run a business

284
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,340
You are the owner of the business

285
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,620
So you have the rule

286
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,100
And your own employees are not under your control

287
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,340
Like the moment you look away

288
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,780
Things are happening and even when you're looking

289
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,060
They're looking straight at you and doing the wrong thing

290
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,500
You're like

291
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,380
Why did I hire you?

292
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,740
So anyway

293
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,740
So you can have owners, you can have rule without control

294
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,500
You can also have ownership without control

295
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,420
A man can own a horse for example

296
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,660
And the horse is not under his control

297
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,180
Right?

298
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,220
It's not under your control

299
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,820
And in fact one of the most interesting examples of ownership

300
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,900
Supposed ownership is our body

301
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,140
Right?

302
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,300
If you think of one thing that you have complete autonomy over

303
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,580
It's your own body

304
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,860
But I don't have control over

305
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,900
You know things like my cholesterol

306
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,500
Or you know my heart rate

307
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,820
Or you know I can't control those things

308
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,260
The way that I would like to

309
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,100
I cannot control aging

310
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,540
The way I would like to

311
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,060
It's not under my control

312
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,460
You know

313
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,620
My if your eyesight is getting weaker

314
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,260
You can't control that

315
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,660
You know you can't control your allergies

316
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,740
So you don't even actually have

317
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,780
We have some level of ownership over our bodies

318
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,380
But we actually don't really have control

319
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,660
So

320
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,060
When Allah describes himself as

321
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,380
Ultimately al-malik

322
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,260
He's taking all three things at once

323
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,820
He's taking rule

324
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,020
He's taking ownership

325
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,540
And he's taking

326
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,340
Control

327
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,940
Which in the real sense

328
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,020
Nobody else can have

329
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,260
You can't have all three

330
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,860
Yourself

331
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,020
It's impossible

332
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,580
And that's why he's al-malik

333
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,300
The ultimate

334
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,620
He's not just a king

335
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,740
He's the ultimate king

336
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,060
Now the other interesting thing

337
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,460
In another ayah in Ali-Imran

338
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,860
Allah did something really remarkable

339
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,420
When it comes to kingdom

340
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,700
Or ownership

341
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,860
Allah separated it from dignity

342
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,500
He says

343
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,580
Tu'til mulkaman tasha

344
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,700
Watanzi'u'l mulkaman tasha

345
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Watanzi'u'l mulkaman tasha

346
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,740
Watanzi'u'l mulkaman tasha

347
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,180
He separated those two concepts

348
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,060
In other words

349
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,020
Allah says

350
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,140
We tell Allah

351
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,620
We ask

352
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,580
We declare to Allah

353
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,580
You give kingdom to whoever you want

354
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,340
And you take it away from whoever you want

355
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,660
And you honor whoever you want

356
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,180
And you humiliate

357
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,260
Whoever you want

358
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,580
You know what that means?

359
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,260
Sometimes Allah will take kingdom away from someone

360
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,620
But they still have honor

361
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,460
Sometimes Allah will give kingdom to someone

362
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,180
But they have humiliation

363
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,780
Separate concepts

364
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,100
In this world we think whoever has kingdom

365
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,620
Has honor

366
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,460
And whoever has no kingdom

367
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,060
Has been humiliated

368
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,700
But Allah says

369
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,780
No, that's a separate thing

370
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,460
That he gives and takes away

371
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,060
And honor and humiliation

372
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,140
Are separate things that he gives and takes away

373
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,180
So for example

374
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,500
Ibrahim alayhi salam has no kingdom

375
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,180
But he's honored

376
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,180
And Namrud has a lot of kingdom

377
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,100
But he's humiliated

378
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,660
You understand

379
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,180
Fir'aun has a lot of kingdom

380
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,540
But he's humiliated

381
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,300
And Musa alayhi salam has no kingdom

382
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,140
But he's honored

383
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,780
So he can give and take as he wants

384
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,380
And then he can give both to someone

385
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,460
He can give honor and kingdom

386
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,500
Like Dawud alayhi salam

387
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,300
Suleiman alayhi salam

388
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,900
He can give both to them

389
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,820
Or he can take both away from them

390
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,940
Like Ayyub alayhi salam

391
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,020
Or he can be humiliated by his family

392
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,460
And even tested in that way

393
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,660
Or Yusuf alayhi salam

394
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,260
He's being humiliated by people

395
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,580
Being falsely accused to be thrown in jail

396
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,300
And then he can give both back to him

397
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,060
He can give his reputation back

398
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,500
He can give kingdom to him

399
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,380
Authority to him

400
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,820
Both of those came back to him

401
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,500
So this is up to Allah Azza wa Jalla

402
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,420
And when we think of Allah as al-malik

403
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,020
Some of these things have to be kept in mind

404
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,100
But I want to dig into al-malik

405
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,940
Some more than even some of the other names

406
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,060
So when you think of the concept of kingdom

407
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,780
What are some thoughts that come in your mind?

408
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,300
First of all is its vastness

409
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,100
You know, a kingdom is only a kingdom

410
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
That's one square kilometer

411
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,620
It's not really a kingdom

412
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,380
But how large is the empire?

413
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,580
How big is the kingdom?

414
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,100
Like the British empire, for example, at some time

415
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,460
You know?

416
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,340
Or the Spaniards when they expanded at some point

417
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,460
Right, the Roman empire

418
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,100
Before them

419
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,740
The Egyptians

420
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,180
The great Egyptian empire

421
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,300
You think of their vastness

422
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,660
Like even Allah mentions this concept of vastness of kingdom

423
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,820
When the Pharaoh spoke in the Quran

424
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,380
Pharaoh says

425
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,020
Do I not alone own the kingdom of Egypt?

426
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,940
So what's he referring to?

427
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,380
The vastness of the kingdom

428
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,460
Now, we're doing this biha valla

429
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,340
With the word king

430
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,780
So when we think of Allah's kingdom

431
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,140
One thing we should think about

432
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,300
Is the vastness of Allah's kingdom

433
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,060
The size, the expanse of Allah's kingdom

434
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
You know, when I walk into

435
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
When I fly into Germany

436
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
I have to show my passport

437
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,500
To be able to enter this kingdom

438
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,500
Give it whatever name

439
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,420
Governance, sovereign nation

440
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,380
Right?

441
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,340
But I have to

442
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,140
And I have to now observe the laws that apply here

443
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,900
The driving rules that apply here

444
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,860
If I go to England where everything is wrong

445
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,620
Then I have to drive on the wrong side

446
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,780
And the car, you know, everything's wrong

447
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,820
But I have to do that because that's what's right there

448
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,860
Okay?

449
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,020
So the idea is

450
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,220
When you walk in, you are under the rule

451
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,620
The territorial rule of that kingdom

452
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,900
And then there are signs, right?

453
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,420
There are, you know, the manifestations of its might

454
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,940
Police, military

455
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,100
The monuments, the castles

456
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,660
The military arsenal

457
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,900
So Allah, as it would just say

458
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,060
Is that people that like to show off their power

459
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,620
Like the Americans like to show off their power

460
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,140
With, you know, the flag and the eagle

461
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,260
And a machine gun or whatever

462
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,540
That's their thing

463
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,620
That's their symbols of power, right?

464
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,580
Military might

465
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,900
Right? A militant nation

466
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,940
Well, you know

467
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,940
Allah describes Nimrud, for example

468
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,700
Who like to show off his power, right?

469
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,300
Allah, in the hadjah

470
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,940
Ibrahim, if you're a prophet, Allah will give you the power

471
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,980
Didn't you see the one who debated against Ibrahim, alayhis salam

472
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,820
Only because Allah had given him kingdom

473
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,580
He wants to show off how powerful he is

474
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,260
He's going to kill someone whoever he wants

475
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,540
He's going to let somebody live

476
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,740
Right?

477
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,500
Demonstration of his might

478
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,260
By the way, interestingly

479
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,020
The most powerful, sustained, powerful nations

480
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,460
Don't like to show off their might

481
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,420
The nations that are truly powerful

482
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,860
They don't have to show it

483
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,060
People recognize it anyway

484
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,980
But they don't have to do it

485
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,140
You know, the nations that are unstable politically

486
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,020
You know what they have to do?

487
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,180
They have to keep reminding their people

488
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,900
Who's in charge

489
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,500
So they have to keep putting a picture of their king

490
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,180
Or the ruler in every place

491
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,180
So, hey, don't forget, that's your king

492
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,340
Okay, before you go to the bathroom

493
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,180
You just say hi to the king and then go to the bathroom

494
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,260
You know, so

495
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,420
They have to do that because

496
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,980
There's no recognition of that power

497
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,820
It has to be forced on the people

498
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,180
But when a kingdom is stable

499
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,260
When a kingdom is stable

500
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,060
You don't have to have flags in your face all the time

501
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,140
You don't have to have the reminder

502
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,660
Of who the king or the authority is

503
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,260
You don't have to do that because

504
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,420
It's already the manifestation of its power

505
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,820
Is actually how smooth the kingdom is running

506
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,540
Almost as though

507
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,020
In political science

508
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,100
The government that is the most invisible

509
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,060
Is the most powerful

510
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,420
You know that?

511
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,100
And the government that's the most visible

512
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,940
Meaning you have to bring the armies out

513
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,380
And the tanks out on the street

514
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
And you have to have soldiers going down the street

515
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,940
That shows you how weak that government has become

516
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,540
Because they cannot control their nation

517
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,820
You understand?

518
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,980
If you think about it from those perspectives

519
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,700
On the one hand, Allah's kingdom is very obvious

520
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,540
The entire universe is Allah's kingdom

521
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,940
But Allah not enforcing His rule in the most visible way

522
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,540
You know, Allahid wa al-Baltin

523
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,940
Which was taught to us in Surat al-Hadeed

524
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,340
Is actually one of the ways you can think about

525
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,340
The manifestation of Allah's power

526
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,300
Allah is so powerful

527
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,820
He doesn't have to become visible

528
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,180
In how He exerts His power

529
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
Lotif al-Lima yasha

530
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,100
He's subtle in how He does things

531
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,020
Delicate in how He does things

532
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,900
Nearly unnoticed in how He does things

533
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,180
You know?

534
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,860
And some things is very obvious

535
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,100
And some things is very delicate and invisible

536
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,340
And that's actually one of the great manifestations

537
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,860
Of the might of Allah Azza wa Jalla

538
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,420
Here's what's coming up in the next episode

539
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,820
And this deeper look of Surat al-Jumu'ah

540
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,580
There are two kinds of ayat in the Quran

541
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,740
There are ayat all around us

542
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,220
And there are ayat of His revelation

543
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,580
But they both go...

544
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,300
They are valuable because they are ayat of the king

545
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,980
Just like the king of the...

546
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,140
The cup of the king in the Surat
