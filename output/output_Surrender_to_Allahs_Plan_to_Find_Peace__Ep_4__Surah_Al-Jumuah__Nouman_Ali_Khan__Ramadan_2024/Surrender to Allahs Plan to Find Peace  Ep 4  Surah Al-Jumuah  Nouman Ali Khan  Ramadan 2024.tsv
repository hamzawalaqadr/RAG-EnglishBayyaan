0	3900	Allah is so powerful he doesn't have to become visible in how he exerts his power
4200	7540	Lotiful limayasha, he's subtle in how he does things
8040	12680	Delicate in how he does things nearly unnoticed in how he does things
13220	17520	You know and some things is very obvious and some things is very delicate and invisible
17520	21280	And that's actually one of the great manifestations of the might of Allah
21280	28560	As-Salaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullah Wa Barakatuh
28560	32760	Bismillah wa Salatu wa Salamu Ala Rasulullah Wa Ala Aali wa Sahbihi Al-Juma'in
32760	35000	Ma ba'at fa a'oudu billahi bin al-Shaytan al-Rajim
35000	36500	Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim
36500	42160	Yusabbihu Lillahi Ma fis Samawati Wa Ma fis Al-Ardil Maliki Al-Quddus Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem
42160	45160	Rabi Al-Shahli al-Sadri wa Yassili Amri
45160	47640	Wa Halu Al-Aukta Tam Billi Saniyya Fqahu Qawli
47640	49140	Amin Ya Rabbi Al-Alamin
49220	52180	Once again everyone, As-Salaamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullah Wa Rahmatullah Wa Rahmatullah
52900	56780	We're gonna start talking about the name Al-Malik of Allah
56780	60220	So Allah is uniquely described himself in this Surah
60220	64580	On the opening ayah with four names Al-Malik Al-Quddus Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem
64580	67820	Many places in the Quran Allah mentions two of his names together
67820	70940	Like Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem, Ghafurun Rahim, things like that, right?
70940	75340	So this Surah is unique because the opening has four names together
75380	79300	So that is a special feature of this Surah
79300	81300	So the first of those names is Al-Malik
81300	85420	It's used rarely in the Quran, it's not as common as you might think
85420	89100	But let's talk about a little bit of where the word Malik comes from
89100	92820	So the word Malik, or the verb Malika
92820	94780	Actually has to do with making something hard
94780	98140	Like you know when you make the dough and the bread
98140	99740	And the dough becomes tougher
99740	102140	That's actually Tamlik of the bread
103100	107220	From it also comes the idea of the Milak
107220	109940	Something is the foundation of a building
109940	112140	Or something that you build on top of
112140	114340	Madakut Tariq is the middle of the road
114340	116860	Meaning the most firm part of the road
116860	120660	Qawaimukulli Dabbatin Mulukuhu
120660	125100	The feet of an animal that it stands firm on
125100	127060	They're also called the Muluk of it
127060	130260	Meaning all of it has to do with firmness, toughness, stability
130380	132460	That sort of thing, these are the meanings in it
132460	134940	When you have control over something
134940	136780	That's called Malika Anshayt
136780	139620	Or you know command over something is a Malika
139620	144060	Malika Nafsahu to have control over yourself is Mulkuh Nafs
144060	145860	If you're able to control your emotions
145860	147860	Or if you're able to control your behavior
147860	151460	So these are the word keeps having to do with Kingdom
151460	154980	Or actually control and power and stability
154980	159100	These are the recurring themes inside of the word Mulk
159220	162940	Then comes the idea of when you hold something firm in your hand
162940	164980	Then you have Mulkuhu over it
164980	168020	So it's something firmly or grasping something firmly
168020	175780	So it's actually interestingly also used when a man is very possessive over his wife
175780	177660	Then they actually say Malika Al-Mar'a
177660	179180	It doesn't mean he owned the woman
179180	181380	It actually means he's very possessive over her
181380	184420	Or very dominating or controlling over her, etc
184420	187140	Now, how is this used for Allah in the Quran?
187180	191900	First of all in the Fatiha we have two readings Malik-e-Omiddin and Malik-e-Omiddin
191900	194540	So Malik and Malik are two different words
194540	196900	So let me help you understand them in easy language
196900	198740	Malik means owner
198740	201180	So I'm the Malik of this laptop
201180	203380	The Malik of this laptop
203380	206580	But I'm definitely not the Malik of this laptop
206580	208940	That would be a little bit dramatic of me
208940	210740	Because I am the owner of this laptop
210740	214780	But I'm definitely not the sovereign king ruler of this laptop
214780	219140	Okay, so you can own a car, you can own a pen, you can own a shirt
219140	222260	But you can't declare yourself the sovereign king of your t-shirt
222260	223580	It doesn't make sense
223580	228660	So the idea of kingdom is vast
228660	231980	The word Malik is used for vast territory
231980	234060	That you can be the king of an island
234060	237420	You can be the king of a country, king of an empire, etc
237420	238180	Right?
238180	240180	In America we use the king very little
240180	242340	This is the king of pizza
242380	244780	And this is the king of tires
244780	248100	Come to the Tire King for your special discount, etc
248100	249620	So they use these words king uselessly
249620	254380	But the idea of kingdom is actually a vast empire of some sense
254380	259140	Interestingly, a phrase in the Qur'an combines both of these concepts
259140	261300	Malik-e-Mulk
261300	264060	Qulillahumma, Malik-e-Mulk
264060	264420	Right?
264420	266340	Which is two different concepts
266340	269980	It actually means the owner of kingdom
269980	274260	So the word for ownership is milk
274260	276700	So it would be Malik-e-Mulk
276700	279220	Or Malik-e-Mulk
279220	282060	So one would be the owner of ownership
282060	284580	Or the king of kingdom
284580	286500	But Allah fused the two phrases together
286500	290900	He said Malik-e-Mulk, which means the owner of kingdom
290900	294700	So let's understand the difference between owner and king a little bit deeper
294700	296820	When I own something
296820	299020	Like if I own this machine
299060	300420	That I'm engaged with it
300420	301500	I'm taking care of it
301500	303780	I have more direct access to it
303780	306020	But if I'm the king of a nation
306020	309620	Do I have control over everyone living under my nation?
309620	313100	No, because generally I have authority
313100	317740	But I don't have direct reach to everything that's under my kingdom
317740	320700	I have to have advisors, governors
320700	323540	Who have to have their own soldiers or their departments
323540	326700	And those departments have lieutenants and so on and so forth
326780	329260	Until you get to, for example
329260	331180	A government is at the top
331180	332700	You have the president or something
332700	334460	And the old days you have a king
334460	338020	And at the bottom you have somebody working at the post office
338020	340500	But the post office worker works for a department
340500	341740	Which answers to a department
341740	342860	Which answers to a department
342860	346060	And eventually goes up all the way to the ultimate authority
346060	347340	You understand?
347340	348660	But in that little department
348660	352540	He acts like he's the king and the post office guy
352540	356660	But the idea is that he's the Malik
356660	358380	Doesn't do direct engagement
358380	360300	But the Malik does
360300	361980	The Malik does direct engagement
361980	364780	Allah takes both of those names and fuses them together
364780	366500	When he says Malik al-Mulk
366500	369260	Another name of Allah is Malik in the Quran
369260	372700	في مقعد صدق عند مليك مقتد
372700	375460	Malik means the one who will always stay the king
375460	376780	It's a some sifah
376780	378940	So the one who will remain king forever
378940	380020	Because kingdoms
380020	382580	What comes in your mind when you think of kingdom?
382580	384860	Somebody inherited the kingdom
384860	388580	Or somebody usurped or took kingdom by force
388580	390180	That's how you get kingdom
390180	393620	And eventually that king whoever took it is going to get old
393620	396220	And he's going to either have a brother or a son
396220	398620	Or a younger son versus an older son
398620	400020	Some drama is going to happen
400020	402300	Right? And kingdom is going to get passed on
402300	404940	The king cannot hold on to the kingdom forever
404940	406940	Allah's name is also Malik
406940	409300	Which means the forever king
409300	410420	The forever king
410420	412220	That's one of Allah's names
412300	416420	Then the interesting thing about the word Malik
416420	417540	When it comes on its own
417540	419180	Al Malik
419180	422380	It's both times associated with
422380	424460	Two times associated with Al Qudus
424460	425740	The next name that's coming
425740	427820	Al Malik Al Qudus is here
427820	431180	Al Malik Al Qudus will also come in Sul'Tul HaShar
431180	432220	Okay? So
432220	434540	Al Malik Al Qudus is Salam al-Mu'min
434540	435660	Right there
435660	438180	And of course there's also the phrase
438180	440900	فَتَعَالَ اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقْ
440900	443580	Which means how high Allah is
443580	446100	The ultimately deserving king
446100	448820	The king who is the king who deserves to be the king
448820	451180	Also because when you think of kingship
451180	455420	You always sometimes think of a person who doesn't deserve it
455420	457620	Right? They don't truly deserve to be the king
457620	460660	They're the useless prince that became the king
460660	463060	Or these people they took over power
463060	465580	And they unjustifiably took over the kingdom
465580	467100	And therefore they became the king
467100	469460	But they're not the rightful king
469460	472460	You know so many movies you haven't seen because you're Islamic
472460	476100	Are about fights against the unrightful unjustified king
476100	478340	And the rightful king comes and wants to
478340	480940	Claim his you know make his claim on the throne
480940	483220	And there's a whatever drama happens right?
483220	487540	So the idea of Al Malik Al Haq is the rightful king
487540	490020	And Allah mentions over and over again in the Quran
490020	491060	لَهُ الْمُلْكُ
491060	493300	He owns all kingdom
493300	494660	He owns all kingdom
494660	496020	It's a very interesting concept
496020	497660	Allah himself is the king
497700	499460	But then he says he owns all kingdom
499460	501140	What's the difference between these two?
501140	502700	One is about Allah himself
502700	504340	He's the king
504340	507580	The other is every king that ever existed
507580	510500	Is actually owned by Allah
510500	512900	He owns all kingdom
512900	516300	Like he owns he decides when they live and when they die
516300	520100	Here they are thinking they decide when someone lives and someone dies
520100	523740	But actually Allah is deciding whether they live and whether they die
523740	524740	Which is why Allah says
524740	526380	لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَا اُلْحَمْ
526380	527580	يُحْيِي وَيُمِي
527580	531620	Like in the Hadid
531620	533460	لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَا الْسَمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ
533460	534740	يُحْيِي وَيُمِيْت
534740	536740	He owns the kingdom of the skies and the earth
536740	539100	He gives life and he gives death
539100	540700	You're distracting them
540700	542580	They're looking at you
542580	544740	There's so many people looking at you right now
544740	547660	It's like I wanted to look at you
547660	548900	That's what happens
548900	551660	Ha!
551660	553180	I keep an eye on you people
553180	555140	Okay anyway
555140	556700	Let's do this Allah
556820	558580	See I have no problem with awkward moments
558580	559620	I have this
559620	560460	It's okay
560460	560940	It's okay
560940	562180	It happens
562180	563340	It was one time I was giving a khutbah
563340	564580	This guy got a phone call
564580	565580	First row
565580	566700	Okay if you're gonna pick up your phone
566700	568380	At least be in the back row
568380	570140	He's in the first row
570140	572020	And you know some people when they get a call
572020	573660	Long distance call
573660	575900	They think it's still 1975
575900	578020	Where they have to talk extra loud
578020	580100	Cause you're going across the ocean
580100	581460	It's a WhatsApp call dude
581460	582900	Everybody gets the same message
582900	584260	Like it's not a different
584260	585420	Hello is everything okay?
585420	586300	Yeah
586300	587620	How's uncle?
587620	588500	Uncle's good
588500	590660	Yeah over and out
590660	594260	It's not a walkie talkie man
594260	595100	Saqqa al khutbah
595100	596300	The guy that started doing this
596300	599300	And I was like in the middle of the khutbah I was like
599300	600940	I just stopped my khutbah
600940	602620	I was like this is a really interesting conversation
602620	605420	Let me just finish
605420	607580	So he took a full 90 seconds
607580	608420	Finished this conversation
608420	609380	I was like is uncle okay?
609380	610140	He goes yeah it's okay
610140	611260	I was like okay
611380	612380	Okay
616380	617660	Anyway
617660	621860	So al-Medic actually has to do with rule
621860	623860	Ownership and control
623860	625660	Let's talk about these three concepts
625660	628660	Rule ownership and control
628660	631540	Is it possible that you can have rule without ownership?
631540	634660	For example the government you live under has rule
634660	637740	But does it have ownership of your property?
637740	638700	It doesn't
638700	640700	Right so there's some level of your own ownership
640700	643260	Even though somebody else has the rule
643260	644460	You have
644460	645780	And the flip can happen
645780	648900	You can have ownership but you don't have what?
648900	651940	Rule you have ownership over your car
651940	656540	But you don't have the rule over it to drive however you want
656540	657620	Okay
657620	660660	You can have ownership over your house
660660	662260	But there are rules in your neighborhood
662260	664900	And you cannot modify it however you want
664900	666420	You cannot make whatever changes you want
666420	667820	There are regulations in place
667860	670740	You have ownership but you don't have rule
670740	672820	So those two things can exist separately
672820	676620	You can also have rule without control
676620	678660	The government in the country can have rule
678660	680660	But does crime still happen?
680660	684100	Yeah so they have rule but they don't have control
684100	684900	Okay
684900	686940	Forget crime even in a government
686940	690060	There's a president, there's a vice president, there's a chancellor
690060	691740	There's whatever other roles
691740	693860	Does the president the higher level authority
693860	698260	Does he necessarily control the behaviors of everybody in his own office?
698260	699140	No
699140	699780	No
699780	701900	In fact forget government even in a business
701900	703620	If many of you run a business
703620	705340	You are the owner of the business
705340	707620	So you have the rule
707620	710100	And your own employees are not under your control
710100	712340	Like the moment you look away
712340	713780	Things are happening and even when you're looking
713780	716060	They're looking straight at you and doing the wrong thing
716060	717500	You're like
717500	719380	Why did I hire you?
719380	720740	So anyway
720740	723740	So you can have owners, you can have rule without control
723780	726500	You can also have ownership without control
726500	728420	A man can own a horse for example
728420	730660	And the horse is not under his control
730660	731180	Right?
731180	732220	It's not under your control
732220	735820	And in fact one of the most interesting examples of ownership
735820	737900	Supposed ownership is our body
737900	738140	Right?
738140	741300	If you think of one thing that you have complete autonomy over
741300	742580	It's your own body
742580	744860	But I don't have control over
744860	746900	You know things like my cholesterol
746900	749500	Or you know my heart rate
749500	751820	Or you know I can't control those things
751820	753260	The way that I would like to
753260	755100	I cannot control aging
755100	756540	The way I would like to
756540	758060	It's not under my control
758060	758460	You know
758460	760620	My if your eyesight is getting weaker
760620	762260	You can't control that
762260	763660	You know you can't control your allergies
763660	764740	So you don't even actually have
764740	767780	We have some level of ownership over our bodies
767780	770380	But we actually don't really have control
770380	771660	So
771660	774060	When Allah describes himself as
774060	775380	Ultimately al-malik
775380	778260	He's taking all three things at once
778260	779820	He's taking rule
779820	781020	He's taking ownership
781020	782540	And he's taking
782540	783340	Control
783340	784940	Which in the real sense
784940	787020	Nobody else can have
787020	789260	You can't have all three
789260	789860	Yourself
789860	791020	It's impossible
791020	792580	And that's why he's al-malik
792580	793300	The ultimate
793300	794620	He's not just a king
794620	796740	He's the ultimate king
796740	798060	Now the other interesting thing
798060	799460	In another ayah in Ali-Imran
799460	800860	Allah did something really remarkable
800860	802420	When it comes to kingdom
802420	804700	Or ownership
804700	806860	Allah separated it from dignity
806860	807500	He says
807500	809580	Tu'til mulkaman tasha
809580	811700	Watanzi'u'l mulkaman tasha
811700	813700	Watanzi'u'l mulkaman tasha
813700	814740	Watanzi'u'l mulkaman tasha
814740	816180	He separated those two concepts
816180	817060	In other words
817060	818020	Allah says
818020	819140	We tell Allah
819140	819620	We ask
819620	820580	We declare to Allah
820580	823580	You give kingdom to whoever you want
823580	826340	And you take it away from whoever you want
826340	828660	And you honor whoever you want
828660	830180	And you humiliate
830180	831260	Whoever you want
831260	832580	You know what that means?
832580	835260	Sometimes Allah will take kingdom away from someone
835260	837620	But they still have honor
837620	839460	Sometimes Allah will give kingdom to someone
839460	841180	But they have humiliation
841260	842780	Separate concepts
842780	845100	In this world we think whoever has kingdom
845100	846620	Has honor
846620	848460	And whoever has no kingdom
848460	850060	Has been humiliated
850060	850700	But Allah says
850700	852780	No, that's a separate thing
852780	854460	That he gives and takes away
854460	856060	And honor and humiliation
856060	858140	Are separate things that he gives and takes away
858140	859180	So for example
859180	861500	Ibrahim alayhi salam has no kingdom
861500	863180	But he's honored
863180	865180	And Namrud has a lot of kingdom
865180	867100	But he's humiliated
867100	867660	You understand
867660	869180	Fir'aun has a lot of kingdom
869180	870540	But he's humiliated
870540	872300	And Musa alayhi salam has no kingdom
872300	874140	But he's honored
874140	876780	So he can give and take as he wants
876780	878380	And then he can give both to someone
878380	880460	He can give honor and kingdom
880460	881500	Like Dawud alayhi salam
881500	882300	Suleiman alayhi salam
882300	883900	He can give both to them
883900	885820	Or he can take both away from them
885820	886940	Like Ayyub alayhi salam
886940	889020	Or he can be humiliated by his family
889020	890460	And even tested in that way
890460	891660	Or Yusuf alayhi salam
891660	893260	He's being humiliated by people
893260	895580	Being falsely accused to be thrown in jail
895580	898300	And then he can give both back to him
898300	900060	He can give his reputation back
900060	901500	He can give kingdom to him
901500	902380	Authority to him
902380	903820	Both of those came back to him
903820	905500	So this is up to Allah Azza wa Jalla
905500	907420	And when we think of Allah as al-malik
907420	909020	Some of these things have to be kept in mind
909020	911100	But I want to dig into al-malik
911100	912940	Some more than even some of the other names
913740	916060	So when you think of the concept of kingdom
916860	918780	What are some thoughts that come in your mind?
918780	920300	First of all is its vastness
921340	923100	You know, a kingdom is only a kingdom
923100	925100	That's one square kilometer
925100	926620	It's not really a kingdom
926620	928380	But how large is the empire?
928380	929580	How big is the kingdom?
929580	933100	Like the British empire, for example, at some time
933740	934460	You know?
934460	937340	Or the Spaniards when they expanded at some point
937340	938460	Right, the Roman empire
938460	939100	Before them
939100	939740	The Egyptians
939740	941180	The great Egyptian empire
941180	942300	You think of their vastness
942300	945660	Like even Allah mentions this concept of vastness of kingdom
945660	947820	When the Pharaoh spoke in the Quran
947820	948380	Pharaoh says
950220	953020	Do I not alone own the kingdom of Egypt?
959740	960940	So what's he referring to?
960940	962380	The vastness of the kingdom
962380	964460	Now, we're doing this biha valla
964460	965340	With the word king
965980	968780	So when we think of Allah's kingdom
968780	970140	One thing we should think about
970140	972300	Is the vastness of Allah's kingdom
973180	976060	The size, the expanse of Allah's kingdom
976700	978700	You know, when I walk into
978700	980700	When I fly into Germany
980700	982700	I have to show my passport
982700	985500	To be able to enter this kingdom
986620	987500	Give it whatever name
987500	989420	Governance, sovereign nation
989580	990380	Right?
990380	991340	But I have to
991340	994140	And I have to now observe the laws that apply here
994140	995900	The driving rules that apply here
995900	998860	If I go to England where everything is wrong
999580	1002620	Then I have to drive on the wrong side
1002620	1004780	And the car, you know, everything's wrong
1005660	1007820	But I have to do that because that's what's right there
1008460	1008860	Okay?
1009580	1011020	So the idea is
1011820	1014220	When you walk in, you are under the rule
1014220	1016620	The territorial rule of that kingdom
1016620	1017900	And then there are signs, right?
1018540	1021420	There are, you know, the manifestations of its might
1021420	1022940	Police, military
1023500	1025100	The monuments, the castles
1025660	1027660	The military arsenal
1028300	1029900	So Allah, as it would just say
1029900	1032060	Is that people that like to show off their power
1032060	1034620	Like the Americans like to show off their power
1034620	1036140	With, you know, the flag and the eagle
1036140	1037260	And a machine gun or whatever
1037900	1038540	That's their thing
1038540	1040620	That's their symbols of power, right?
1040620	1041580	Military might
1042220	1043900	Right? A militant nation
1043900	1044940	Well, you know
1044940	1046940	Allah describes Nimrud, for example
1046940	1048700	Who like to show off his power, right?
1048700	1050300	Allah, in the hadjah
1050300	1052940	Ibrahim, if you're a prophet, Allah will give you the power
1052940	1055980	Didn't you see the one who debated against Ibrahim, alayhis salam
1055980	1057820	Only because Allah had given him kingdom
1057820	1059580	He wants to show off how powerful he is
1059580	1061260	He's going to kill someone whoever he wants
1061260	1062540	He's going to let somebody live
1063260	1063740	Right?
1063740	1065500	Demonstration of his might
1066140	1067260	By the way, interestingly
1067260	1071020	The most powerful, sustained, powerful nations
1071020	1072460	Don't like to show off their might
1073900	1075420	The nations that are truly powerful
1076140	1076860	They don't have to show it
1076860	1078060	People recognize it anyway
1079180	1079980	But they don't have to do it
1079980	1082140	You know, the nations that are unstable politically
1082140	1083020	You know what they have to do?
1083020	1085180	They have to keep reminding their people
1085180	1085900	Who's in charge
1087100	1089500	So they have to keep putting a picture of their king
1089500	1091180	Or the ruler in every place
1091180	1093180	So, hey, don't forget, that's your king
1094140	1095340	Okay, before you go to the bathroom
1095340	1097180	You just say hi to the king and then go to the bathroom
1098460	1099260	You know, so
1100140	1101420	They have to do that because
1101980	1103980	There's no recognition of that power
1103980	1105820	It has to be forced on the people
1105820	1107180	But when a kingdom is stable
1108060	1109260	When a kingdom is stable
1109260	1112060	You don't have to have flags in your face all the time
1112060	1114140	You don't have to have the reminder
1114140	1115660	Of who the king or the authority is
1115660	1117260	You don't have to do that because
1117260	1119420	It's already the manifestation of its power
1119420	1121820	Is actually how smooth the kingdom is running
1121820	1122540	Almost as though
1123740	1125020	In political science
1125020	1127100	The government that is the most invisible
1127100	1128060	Is the most powerful
1128940	1129420	You know that?
1129420	1131100	And the government that's the most visible
1131100	1132940	Meaning you have to bring the armies out
1132940	1134380	And the tanks out on the street
1134380	1136380	And you have to have soldiers going down the street
1136380	1138940	That shows you how weak that government has become
1138940	1140540	Because they cannot control their nation
1141180	1141820	You understand?
1142860	1145980	If you think about it from those perspectives
1145980	1148700	On the one hand, Allah's kingdom is very obvious
1148700	1150540	The entire universe is Allah's kingdom
1151580	1154940	But Allah not enforcing His rule in the most visible way
1154940	1156540	You know, Allahid wa al-Baltin
1156540	1158940	Which was taught to us in Surat al-Hadeed
1159580	1161340	Is actually one of the ways you can think about
1161340	1163340	The manifestation of Allah's power
1163340	1164300	Allah is so powerful
1164300	1165820	He doesn't have to become visible
1165820	1167180	In how He exerts His power
1167180	1169180	Lotif al-Lima yasha
1169180	1171100	He's subtle in how He does things
1171100	1173020	Delicate in how He does things
1173020	1175900	Nearly unnoticed in how He does things
1176620	1177180	You know?
1177180	1178860	And some things is very obvious
1178860	1181100	And some things is very delicate and invisible
1181100	1183340	And that's actually one of the great manifestations
1183340	1184860	Of the might of Allah Azza wa Jalla
1187340	1189420	Here's what's coming up in the next episode
1189420	1191820	And this deeper look of Surat al-Jumu'ah
1219420	1221580	There are two kinds of ayat in the Quran
1221580	1223740	There are ayat all around us
1223740	1226220	And there are ayat of His revelation
1226220	1227580	But they both go...
1227580	1230300	They are valuable because they are ayat of the king
1230300	1231980	Just like the king of the...
1231980	1234140	The cup of the king in the Surat
