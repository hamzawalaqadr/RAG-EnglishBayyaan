0	2000	Isn't this something that's supposed to be heard?
2000	3500	Yatlu a'adayhim a'ayati?
3500	5000	You're not wondering about it.
5000	6500	You're not being brought close.
6500	8000	You're not reaching conviction.
8500	10000	This is our first failure.
10000	11000	When we say,
11000	13000	Oh, the ummah is going in a bad direction.
13000	13500	What do we do?
13500	15500	Well, the prophet was given a formula.
15500	17000	Here's step one.
17000	18500	But I want step 17.
19000	19500	No.
20000	21000	Step one.
21500	24000	Yatlu a'adayhim a'ayati.
24500	26000	The Prophet
29500	31500	So we did me and Finn,
31500	33000	Fee and Min.
33000	36000	But I will tell you now a little bit about the...
36000	37500	I'll introduce this now,
37500	39000	but we'll go into detail tomorrow,
39000	40000	inshallah.
40000	42000	And that is
42000	45500	that Allah chose a nation
45500	48000	since the time of Musa A.S.
48000	51500	He chose a nation to be the carriers of His word.
51500	53500	That was the sons of Israel.
53500	55500	He chose them and he gave them his book,
55500	56500	at Ta'urat.
57000	59500	And they were chosen and given preference
59500	61500	over all other nations in the world.
61500	63500	This is what the Quran itself tells us.
63500	64500	Okay?
64500	66000	We fadladnaakum ale ala alameen.
66000	69000	We gave you preference over all other nations.
69000	71500	No other nation had this many prophets.
71500	73500	No other nation had this many chances
73500	76500	to live by and demonstrate the truth of Allah's book.
77500	79000	Over time,
79000	80500	not all the Israelites,
80500	81500	but a group among them,
81500	84500	developed a certain kind of superiority complex.
85000	86000	Okay?
86000	87500	Now this is really important.
87500	89000	We hate it
89000	92500	when somebody quotes something from the Quran
92500	93500	and says,
93500	95500	all these Muslims, this is what they believe.
95500	96500	You see?
96500	98500	It says, like, some of our, you know,
98500	99500	back home,
99500	101500	ah, these Muslims.
101500	103500	Look at what it says in their Quran.
103500	106500	It says, kill them wherever you find them.
106500	108500	This is what they believe.
108500	111500	They want to kill you wherever they find you.
111500	114500	It says it right here in your book.
115500	117500	We hate that because we know
117500	118500	that's,
118500	120500	you're taking it out of context.
120500	121500	You don't know what that means.
121500	123500	And you could have just asked one of us,
123500	126500	but you would rather quote something out of place,
126500	128500	and then we get really offended.
128500	132500	We shouldn't do that to their books.
132500	135500	Because we hate it ourselves.
135500	137500	We shouldn't take one quote from the Bible here,
137500	138500	one quote from the Bible saying,
138500	139500	look at what these people believe.
139500	141500	Look at what's in their book.
141500	143500	Look at, no, no, that's not fair.
143500	144500	That's not fair.
144500	147500	And when some Muslims do something bad,
147500	150500	and they say all Muslims are like this,
150500	152500	we hate it.
152500	157500	But if some Jews or some Christians do something wrong,
157500	160500	and we take the sum and say what?
160500	162500	All Christians are like this.
162500	163500	We hate it.
163500	165500	Is that justice?
165500	166500	Is that fair?
166500	168500	Is that a double standard?
168500	170500	We should be people of justice.
170500	173500	The Quran is actually extremely just
173500	176500	in the way it deals with the Christians and the Jews.
176500	178500	And our relationship with the Jews
178500	180500	and our relationship with the Christians
180500	182500	is very interesting in the Quran.
182500	183500	It's not one relationship.
183500	185500	It's multiple relationships.
185500	187500	It's not one relationship.
187500	188500	On the one hand,
188500	192500	one of the audiences of the Quran are the rabbis
192500	193500	and the priests.
193500	195500	That's one specific audience.
195500	197500	They're called Ahlul Kitab in the Quran.
197500	199500	Allah talks to them and says what?
199500	200500	Ahlul Kitab.
200500	203500	And that's referring not to all Christians
203500	204500	and all Jews.
204500	205500	Who's it referring to?
205500	207500	The rabbis and the priests.
207500	209500	Our religion, the book,
209500	211500	targeted the most knowledgeable people
211500	212500	in their religion
212500	214500	and had a conversation with them.
214500	216500	That's number one.
216500	218500	Another audience in the Quran
218500	220500	is the historical Jews
220500	222500	and the historical Christians,
222500	226500	some of them who made some very serious mistakes.
226500	228500	And he criticizes the some of them
228500	229500	that made very serious mistakes.
229500	231500	By the way, in Islamic history,
231500	232500	since the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
232500	234500	are there some Muslims and Muslim nations
234500	237500	and governments that made very serious mistakes?
237500	238500	Yeah.
238500	240500	Now, though, what we like to do
240500	241500	when we talk about Islamic history,
241500	243500	we talk about Salah-e-Din.
243500	245500	Like, we talk about Rasul Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
245500	247500	Abu Bakr, Omar,
247500	249500	Othman, Ali-Radiullah, and Amr.
249500	251500	Okay, golden years, fast forward.
251500	254500	Salah-e-Din, fast forward right now.
254500	257500	And all the chapters of Islamic history
257500	259500	that are not so glorious,
259500	261500	where we did not so nice things,
261500	264500	where we may have committed some part of genocide,
264500	266500	or we may have colluded and done something wrong,
266500	268500	we kind of
268500	270500	skip those chapters and say,
270500	271500	You're unmar.
271500	273500	You say, beautiful.
273500	276500	I have to get the unmar back.
276500	277500	And you're like,
277500	279500	Yes, unmar.
279500	281500	Even though you don't...
281500	282500	Can you tell me the history of the Oman
282500	283500	the last 200 years?
283500	286500	300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 years?
286500	288500	Can you tell me?
288500	289500	Can you tell me what the rule was like?
289500	290500	Can you tell me what...
290500	293500	You know, no, no, no, but overall, we were good.
293500	295500	Overall, they were bad.
295500	297500	Overall, we were good.
297500	298500	You know what that is?
298500	300500	That's delusional thinking.
300500	301500	And that's dishonesty.
301500	303500	That's intellectual dishonesty.
303500	307500	The Israelites had an issue.
307500	308500	Some of them.
308500	313500	They looked at their history and only focused on the good parts.
313500	316500	Oh, look, we are the people of Ibrahim,
316500	317500	we're the people of Musa,
317500	318500	we're the people of this,
318500	319500	we're the people of this.
319500	320500	Allah spoke to us on the mountain.
320500	321500	We're so special because of this reason,
321500	324500	this reason, this reason, this reason, this reason.
324500	326500	And what did they skip?
326500	328500	The embarrassing parts of their history.
328500	330500	They skipped those parts.
330500	331500	Not all of them did this,
331500	332500	but some of them did this.
332500	335500	By the way, does that sound like a familiar disease?
335500	338500	The Muslims have selective citation of history?
338500	342500	Did we develop our psychology based on selective chapters of history?
342500	343500	Yeah.
343500	346500	Why is the Prophet telling us you're going to become like them?
346500	348500	Same.
348500	350500	And then what does Allah do in the Quran?
350500	352500	Especially in Surat Al-Baqara.
352500	357500	He highlights a part of their history that they don't like to talk about.
357500	361500	He highlighted the ugly chapters of Israelite history.
361500	362500	And that even said,
362500	364500	Well, ya'af, anka thir, and by the way,
364500	366500	there's a lot that I'm skipping.
366500	368500	There's a lot more,
368500	371500	but this should be enough for you to get the point.
371500	374500	There's a lot more dirty laundry.
374500	375500	But why was Allah doing this?
375500	378500	It was not to humiliate the Israelites.
378500	380500	It was actually to teach Muslims something,
380500	381500	which is what?
381500	384500	Be honest with yourselves.
384500	386500	And then the other part of the Israelite history,
386500	387500	in the Quran,
387500	390500	so we've got the rabbis and the priests being talked to,
390500	392500	selective history being addressed.
392500	393500	Among some of them,
393500	397500	the third, there are heroes in Israelite history.
397500	399500	That are our heroes.
399500	401500	Not just their prophets.
401500	405500	وَكَأَيْمِ النَّبِيْنْ قَاتَلَمَ عَهُرِ بِيْوْنَا كَثِيرْ
405500	408500	When Muslims were about to go into the battle of Uhud,
408500	410500	you know who their inspiration was in the Quran?
410500	413500	Those who fought alongside the Israelite prophets.
413500	415500	Who were they?
415500	417500	The Israelites.
417500	418500	The Jews of that time.
418500	421500	They were be considered the Muslims of that time.
421500	424500	And they are our inspiration in the Quran.
424500	425500	Actually.
425500	427500	So what I'm saying is,
427500	430500	we think that the Quran paints one stroke,
430500	432500	one picture of who the Jews are,
432500	435500	one picture of who the Christians are in the Quran.
435500	437500	That is absolutely not the case.
437500	441500	In some places of certain groups, highly critical.
441500	444500	In some places of certain groups, praising.
444500	446500	And in the current times,
446500	448500	the Muslims would be like,
448500	450500	No, we know something about the historical Jews.
450500	452500	Some of them were praiseworthy.
452500	454500	Some of them were criticism worthy.
454500	456500	But what about the Jews we're living with in Medina?
456500	457500	What about them?
457500	458500	Allah says,
458500	461500	وَمَنْهُمْ مَنْ اِنْتَ مَنْهُبِقِنْطَارِنْ يُؤْدِّهِ لَيْكَ
461500	464500	وَمَنْهُمْ مَنْ اِنْتَ مَنْهُبِدِيْنَارِ لَيْوَدِّهِ لَيْكَ
464500	466500	Among them are people,
466500	470500	if you trusted them with piles and piles of wealth,
470500	473500	they will give it back to you 100%.
473500	475500	And among them, there are those,
475500	477500	if you give them even one penny,
477500	480500	they will not give it back to you.
480500	482500	And the second group,
482500	483500	so the first one,
483500	486500	and by the way, he mentioned the honest ones first.
486500	489500	He prioritized the honest ones.
489500	490500	He even said about them,
490500	492500	وَمَا يَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلَنْ يُكْفَرُواهُ
492500	494500	The good deeds they do, they will not be denied of them.
494500	496500	This is Quran.
496500	497500	This is Quran.
497500	498500	And then he said,
498500	500500	and the ones that will not even give you back one penny,
500500	502500	he said one thing about them.
502500	503500	He said,
503500	505500	ذَالِكَ بِأَنْ نَقَالُوا لَيْسَ عَلَيْسَ عَلَيْنَ فِي الْأُمْمِيِّينَ سَبِيلَ
505500	506500	That's because they said,
506500	508500	when it comes to the J...
508500	509500	الْأُمْمِيِّينَ
509500	510500	You heard the word,
510500	513500	الْأُمْمِيِّينَ لَيْسَ عَلَيْنَ فِي الْأُمْمِيِّينَ سَبِيلَ
513500	514500	Among...
514500	517500	When it comes to these uneducated people,
517500	520500	these un-blessed people,
520500	522500	we don't owe them anything.
522500	525500	So among them, an extreme group came,
525500	526500	not all of them,
526500	528500	but an extreme group came within them,
528500	530500	and what beliefs did they develop?
530500	532500	They developed a belief that if you steal from,
532500	535500	they considered the rest of the world impure.
535500	536500	Najas.
536500	538500	Okay, the ones that were pure are the...
538500	540500	These realites, everybody else's?
540500	541500	Najas.
541500	542500	And since they're najas,
542500	544500	if a najas steals from me,
544500	546500	if an impure one steals from me,
546500	547500	they better pay me back.
547500	549500	But if I steal from them,
549500	551500	I don't have to pay them back.
551500	553500	And they developed that mentality.
553500	555500	And the Qur'an came in what?
555500	557500	Attack that mentality.
557500	559500	Those are the ones that can't be trusted.
559500	561500	Now, fast forward.
561500	563500	I'm in Europe,
563500	564500	fun place,
564500	567500	in a country that shall not be named.
568500	569500	And I met a brother.
569500	570500	I was like,
570500	572500	Masha'Allah, I'm...
572500	573500	I have one son.
573500	574500	His name is Muhammad.
574500	576500	I was like, beautiful name.
576500	577500	I was like, yeah, but I told the government,
577500	578500	I have four sons,
578500	580500	and I spelled Muhammad M-U-H-A,
580500	583500	M-O-H-A, M-O-U-H-A,
583500	586500	with a double M, with a single M.
586500	588500	And I get benefits for four sons.
589500	591500	I collect four checks from the kufar.
593500	594500	Masha'Allah.
595500	596500	I don't even pay rent.
596500	598500	Alhamdulillah.
600500	601500	I was like, oh,
601500	605500	I've heard this.
605500	607500	I've seen this before.
607500	610500	You can steal from them because they're what?
610500	613500	I go, father, let us steal from them.
614500	615500	This was something that we,
615500	619500	the Quran criticized this about a group of people before.
619500	621500	But whose behavior is this?
622500	623500	This is now,
623500	624500	not all Muslims,
624500	626500	but some Muslims, absolutely.
627500	628500	Absolutely their behavior.
629500	631500	So this mentality,
631500	632500	this mindset,
632500	635500	is actually what the Quran criticizes.
635500	636500	However, now,
636500	638500	among them were those who said,
638500	640500	these ummiyyn are less.
640500	642500	Then they developed other narratives.
642500	644500	The Abraham had two children.
644500	645500	The children of,
645500	647500	or the lineases,
647500	649500	the children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael.
649500	651500	Ishaq and Isma'id.
651500	653500	And they developed an entire literature
653500	655500	how Isma'id is not even legitimate,
655500	658500	which is according to the Bible, not true.
658500	660500	He is legitimate in the Bible.
660500	662500	Oh, Isma'id is not really his son.
662500	665500	Or Isma'id is the cursed son.
665500	667500	So all of his children are going to be what?
667500	670500	They're going to be cursed, right?
670500	672500	The cursed line of Ishmael.
672500	674500	I've even heard sermons and churches about that.
674500	676500	The cursed line of Ishmael.
676500	677500	Then they developed some of the,
677500	682500	developed this concept of the non-Jews being goyim.
682500	684500	Goyim is their word for ummi.
684500	685500	Uneducated, unlettered.
685500	687500	They don't know what the wahi is.
687500	689500	But they became so extreme.
689500	690500	Some of them became so extreme.
690500	692500	Even the Jews among them
692500	694500	that did not belong to their elite class,
694500	696500	they were also called goyim.
696500	698500	Also called ummiyyn.
699500	701500	So they get even more exclusive.
701500	703500	Now, of course, Muslims don't do this.
703500	705500	Muslims don't have some group that says
705500	707500	we're the right ones.
707500	709500	Everybody else is going to Jahannam.
709500	710500	And then eventually they say
710500	712500	we're the only few Muslims that are right.
712500	714500	And all the other Muslims, 72 sects,
714500	716500	are all going to burn in Jahannam.
716500	719500	Thank God I belong to the special Golden Club.
719500	721500	Mutahar Club, right?
721500	723500	Because everybody else is just nudges.
723500	724500	I don't know.
724500	726500	I don't even know if I should pray next to these people.
726500	729500	I don't even know if I can say salam to them or...
729500	732500	So forget their condescending view
732500	734500	of the rest of humanity.
734500	736500	They even developed a condescending view
736500	738500	of fellow believers.
738500	740500	And this is not new.
740500	742500	This happened already in what history?
742500	743500	In Israelite history.
743500	744500	And our prophet told us,
744500	746500	لزت بيعن صدر الذين من قبلكم
746500	748500	You will end up following the ways
748500	750500	of the people who came before you.
751500	753500	Allah says in this ayah,
753500	755500	He sent a messenger.
755500	757500	And raised them among who?
757500	759500	The Umayyin,
759500	761500	the people that the Israelites considered what?
761500	763500	Nudges.
763500	765500	The people that were unworthy.
765500	768500	The people from the cursed line of Ismail.
768500	769500	In the previous ayah,
769500	771500	He used the word on Qudus,
771500	773500	the holy, the pure.
773500	775500	And the Israelites believed because of that name.
775500	777500	Who did He make pure?
777500	778500	Them.
778500	780500	Some of them even developed this fatwa
780500	783500	that whoever stood under the mountain,
783500	785500	and their children are forever pure.
785500	787500	And whoever was not under the mountain,
787500	789500	their children are forever impure.
789500	791500	Cool.
791500	793500	So now Allah takes this concept of superiority
793500	794500	and says,
794500	795500	By the way,
795500	796500	I'm going to send a messenger.
796500	798500	And whom am I going to send it among?
798500	800500	The Umayyin.
800500	802500	Umayyin, by the way,
802500	803500	really cool word.
803500	805500	Really epic word.
805500	807500	Umayyin has a couple of meanings.
807500	810500	One, belonging to a certain nation from Ummah.
810500	812500	So these were nationalistic people.
812500	814500	Or ethnic peoples.
814500	816500	But Ummah also means,
816500	818500	Ka'annahu Kharaja min Ummi.
818500	820500	As if he knows nothing like the day
820500	822500	he came out of his mother.
822500	823500	Ummi means mother, right?
823500	825500	Ummi means so uneducated,
825500	827500	so unknowledgeable about the work,
827500	829500	about the revelation, about God,
829500	830500	about prophets.
830500	832500	As if he just came out of his mother.
832500	834500	No background, no history,
834500	837500	no intellectual, scholarly history, nothing.
837500	841500	Allah decided to send a messenger among these people.
841500	845500	Could Allah have sent a messenger among the Roman Empire?
845500	848500	Among the Greeks who have a history of philosophy?
848500	851500	Among the Chinese who have poetry, literature?
851500	854500	Among the Indians who have the Sanskrit philosophies?
854500	856500	And they were into the Persians?
856500	858500	There were so many civilizations in the world
858500	861500	that have long standing intellectual histories
861500	863500	and empires and civilizations.
863500	865500	And the one place in the world that was forgotten
865500	867500	that nobody knows about, nobody cares.
867500	869500	Is what?
869500	871500	That Arabian desert, man.
871500	873500	There's a Roman Empire on this side.
873500	875500	There's the Persian Empire on that side.
875500	877500	There's the Abyssinian Empire on that side.
877500	879500	And even they don't care that you're in the middle
879500	881500	because this is sand.
881500	884500	They don't want to expand into this territory.
884500	887500	Let them be. Let these shepherds do their thing.
887500	889500	Let these camel herders do their thing.
889500	890500	Who cares about them?
890500	892500	They are a forgotten chapter of history.
892500	894500	When you go across the Khalij,
894500	896500	when you go across the desert of Hijaz,
896500	898500	did you see ancient palaces?
898500	901500	Did you see the ruins of great civilizations?
901500	902500	Did you see it?
902500	903500	Nothing.
903500	906500	These people have no education, no background.
906500	909500	And they just go and they go towards Syria,
909500	911500	and they go towards Yemen,
911500	913500	and they do their little trade.
913500	915500	Sometimes they end up in Roman territory near Syria.
915500	917500	Sometimes they go towards the Africa
917500	919500	and make a little bit of money here,
919500	921500	make a little bit of money there.
921500	922500	And they're a great city.
922500	924500	It's a city that happens to have a well.
924500	926500	That's like, oh my God, you're in Makkah.
926500	929500	Makkah is nice. You got a well.
931500	933500	It's got burnt rock.
933500	935500	It's got insanely hot temperate.
935500	937500	How many people have been to Makkah?
937500	938500	Does it look like a tourist attraction
938500	939500	if it wasn't for the haram?
939500	942500	Would a human being have any reason
942500	945500	to go to Makkah if it wasn't for the Ka'bah?
945500	947500	Like what?
947500	949500	When you go there,
950500	952500	the Horses Allah, you would rather...
952500	954500	People walk, people get up late for the Horses Allah,
954500	956500	so they end up praying inside the mall.
956500	958500	So they don't have to pray.
959500	962500	Because the beating Sun, man, the beating...
962500	965500	And among them, a less-than-to-messenger?
965500	967500	Among them?
967500	971500	First, he describes the ultimate king of all kings,
971500	973500	and then he takes the most forgotten,
973500	979500	the most, like, kind of unimportant part of the world map.
979500	981500	You know?
981500	983500	The insignificant part of the world map
983500	985500	and says, yep, right here.
985500	988500	Why? Because thousands of years before,
988500	990500	there was a man named Ibrahim A.S.
990500	993500	who built his house in this unknown desert
993500	996500	and made a dua thousands of years ago.
996500	998500	Ya Allah, send a messenger among these people
998500	1001500	and bring people's hearts towards this hot desert
1001500	1003500	where nobody's heart would want to go.
1003500	1005500	People would rather go to Hawaii,
1005500	1006500	they would rather go to California,
1006500	1008500	they would rather go to Switzerland,
1008500	1009500	they would rather go to New Zealand,
1009500	1012500	they would rather go anywhere else, not here.
1012500	1015500	But ya Allah, bring people's hearts here
1015500	1017500	and give them, give, send them a messenger here.
1017500	1020500	Thousands of years ago, there was no recorder at the time,
1020500	1023500	there was no microphone, there was no camera that recorded this,
1023500	1024500	there was no writer who wrote this down,
1024500	1026500	it was just him and God talking.
1026500	1028500	Ya Allah, send a messenger among these people
1028500	1030500	that are going to settle here.
1030500	1031500	That's this dua.
1031500	1033500	And thousands of years after that,
1033500	1034500	what does Allah do?
1034500	1036500	He decides to send among these people
1036500	1038500	who have been pagan for centuries.
1038500	1040500	By the way, the house that Abraham built
1040500	1042500	is surrounded by what?
1042500	1043500	Idols for centuries.
1043500	1044500	These are pagan people.
1044500	1046500	Even if we lived at the time,
1046500	1047500	we were like, oh, Mushrikun,
1047500	1048500	enna ma al Mushrikun al Najas,
1048500	1050500	the Mushrikun al Najas, they're filthy.
1050500	1052500	The Zut-e-Quran describes them,
1052500	1053500	people of Shirkah are dirty,
1053500	1055500	because spiritual dirt is on them.
1055500	1058500	So the Israelites consider them unworthy, dirty.
1058500	1061500	Look, they're pagans, they're idol worshipers.
1061500	1064500	Look at what they believe, these false religions.
1064500	1067500	And among them, Allah decides to send a messenger.
1067500	1069500	Suhan Allah.
1069500	1071500	What a decision Allah made,
1071500	1072500	the king of all kings.
1072500	1074500	And the way he's going to describe that decision,
1074500	1076500	that he let them, it's not even,
1076500	1078500	and I know it's time,
1078500	1082500	he could have been an Arab from among them,
1082500	1085500	but he was raised among the Romans.
1085500	1087500	So he knows higher society, you know?
1087500	1089500	Or he was raised among the Greek,
1089500	1090500	or he was raised among the Persian,
1090500	1092500	so he gets to know what royalty is like.
1092500	1094500	You know, like Musa'a al-Asa'alam was among the Israelites,
1094500	1096500	but he was raised where?
1096500	1098500	He was raised in the palace.
1098500	1099500	So Allah could have raised the prophets
1099500	1101500	like Suhan Allah in a palace somewhere,
1101500	1104500	and then he can come and bring higher education to his people.
1104500	1107500	No, he was raised within them.
1107500	1109500	He's from them and he's within them.
1109500	1111500	The highest education the human being,
1111500	1114500	humanity ever received as the word of Allah,
1114500	1117500	and it came in a place that was the least educated,
1117500	1119500	arguably on earth.
1119500	1122500	That's where it began, from absolute zero.
1122500	1124500	From absolute zero.
1124500	1127500	And there, today you and I are sitting here.
1127500	1128500	SubhanAllah.
1128500	1131500	Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.
1131500	1133500	Just before you continue, I want to let you know
1133500	1135500	and encourage you that I want you to sign up
1135500	1137500	for bayinatv.com and help other sign up,
1137500	1139500	or even sponsor students for bayinatv.com
1139500	1142500	so we can create worldwide communities of students
1142500	1144500	that are studying the meanings and the benefit
1144500	1146500	and the wisdom of the Quran,
1146500	1148500	and are insha'Allah ta'ala spreading that in their own circles.
1148500	1149500	Thanks so much.
1149500	1151500	In ayah number two of Surat al-Jum'ah,
1151500	1153500	Allah will not just introduce us
1153500	1155500	where and how He raised this messenger,
1155500	1157500	which we talked about in the last session.
1157500	1159500	Allah will introduce us to four things
1159500	1161500	that the messenger is going to do.
1161500	1163500	His mission is being summarized
1163500	1165500	as four tasks.
1165500	1166500	Okay?
1166500	1168500	And this is almost as if
1168500	1171500	there's what he's supposed to do,
1171500	1175500	what his goal is, is actually mentioned in Surah Tussaf.
1175500	1177500	In the previous Surah, Allah mentioned
1177500	1179500	what is the goal of sending the messenger.
1179500	1181500	But every time you have a goal,
1181500	1184500	you have to have a method so you can reach that goal.
1184500	1187500	You have to have a formula, a practice to reach that goal.
1187500	1189500	To make it super simple, if somebody says,
1189500	1193500	I want you to become good enough so you can join the team,
1193500	1195500	then they have to have a training program,
1195500	1197500	some kind of formula they have to follow,
1197500	1198500	then they can get there.
1198500	1200500	What is the regiment that he's going to follow?
1200500	1203500	This ayah is about the method,
1203500	1205500	the process of the Prophet,
1205500	1207500	sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
1207500	1209500	And before we get into that process,
1209500	1213500	I just want you to know that this process is forever true.
1213500	1216500	Like this isn't just, it was started by the Prophet,
1216500	1217500	alayhi sallallahu alayhi wa sallam,
1217500	1221500	and then it was passed down until judgment day
1221500	1224500	for the ummah to learn that this is the process to do what?
1224500	1227500	This is the process to bring about change.
1227500	1229500	Now there are two kinds of change.
1229500	1230500	There's change inside a person,
1230500	1232500	and there's change inside society.
1232500	1236500	You see around you someone who was not praying,
1236500	1238500	they were drinking alcohol,
1238500	1241500	they were basically kind of practically not a Muslim,
1241500	1243500	and then something changed,
1243500	1245500	and they became a completely different person.
1245500	1247500	The way the people they hang out with,
1247500	1249500	the way they spend their time, their prayers,
1249500	1251500	their drinking and eating habits,
1251500	1252500	everything changed.
1252500	1254500	There was a revolution inside them,
1254500	1257500	and they became a completely different individual.
1257500	1259500	That's personal change.
1259500	1261500	And then because of that one person,
1261500	1263500	maybe their friends, some of them started changing.
1263500	1266500	Maybe their community started changing a little bit.
1266500	1268500	And those kinds of changes happen every day.
1268500	1271500	There are people that experience these amazing transformations.
1271500	1274500	So many of you have come up to me and told me,
1274500	1276500	hey, I wasn't even praying five months ago,
1276500	1278500	or I wasn't even wearing hijab a year ago,
1278500	1280500	or four months ago, or five months ago, etc.
1280500	1282500	There are changes happening even in this room.
1282500	1283500	And some of you are,
1283500	1285500	and it's not like the change is complete,
1285500	1287500	you're still changing, you're still on the road to change.
1287500	1292500	The problem happens is when we see the world,
1292500	1295500	and we see that it's getting worse, right?
1295500	1297500	And disobedience to Allah is increasing,
1297500	1299500	and chaos is increasing,
1299500	1301500	and shamelessness is increasing,
1301500	1303500	and disbelief is increasing,
1303500	1305500	and confusion is increasing,
1305500	1306500	we get depressed,
1306500	1310500	because we see the big picture looks worse and worse and worse.
1310500	1312500	And when you look at the big picture,
1312500	1313500	it does look pretty depressing.
1313500	1315500	And what that does is it makes you blind
1315500	1318500	to the individual changes.
1318500	1322500	Because it feels like the individual changes are not enough,
1322500	1326500	because real change is when it happens on a very large scale.
1326500	1328500	If you think about the life of the Prophet,
1328500	1329500	Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
1329500	1333500	if Allah wanted big change to happen from the beginning,
1333500	1335500	Allah would have sent the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam
1335500	1339500	to the economic or the political capitals or centers of the world.
1339500	1341500	But Allah sent the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam
1341500	1344500	to a place that was not an economic player,
1344500	1346500	not a cap, not a political player,
1346500	1348500	not a social player, not a cultural player,
1348500	1349500	not an educational center,
1349500	1352500	it was not a contributor to the world.
1352500	1353500	You could say about the Chinese,
1353500	1355500	they were contributing silk,
1355500	1358500	or they were contributing other fine goods or arts to the world.
1358500	1360500	You could say things about the Romans, the Persians,
1360500	1364500	the other civilizations were players on the world scene,
1364500	1368500	and trade and craft and civilization and empire building, all of it.
1368500	1371500	What were the ancient Arabs doing in the desert?
1371500	1373500	They had some empires back in the day,
1373500	1375500	some large stretches of empire,
1375500	1377500	but that was gone for centuries and centuries.
1377500	1380500	They were not players on the world stage.
1380500	1382500	And even the changes that the Prophet brought,
1382500	1384500	Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,
1384500	1387500	and the Quran that kept teaching this message,
1387500	1390500	what are some of the Quran's greatest heroes?
1390500	1392500	There are people like Nuh Alaihi Wasallam.
1392500	1394500	And if you study the life of Nuh Alaihi Wasallam,
1394500	1397500	and you say, I want to see the big change that was brought by Nuh Alaihi Wasallam.
1397500	1400500	What's his progress report after 10 years?
1400500	1401500	And what's the, you know, because you're in your company,
1401500	1403500	you have to have a progress report, right?
1403500	1406500	How much more did your sphere of influence grow
1406500	1409500	after 50 years, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500?
1409500	1412500	950 years. Where's the progress?
1412500	1415500	You didn't even make progress with your own son?
1415500	1417500	What is this?
1417500	1421500	You don't call this, but they are heroes in the Quran.
1421500	1424500	And Ibrahim Alaihi Wasallam, this is called the religion of Ibrahim Alaihi Wasallam,
1424500	1427500	couldn't even convince his own dad, could he?
1427500	1430500	And Yaqub Alaihi Wasallam couldn't convince his own sons for a long time.
1430500	1432500	You couldn't do that.
1432500	1435500	Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was sent to the Quraysh
1435500	1439500	and the vast majority of them for the first 13 years, did they believe or not?
1439500	1442500	No, the vast majority of them didn't believe.
1442500	1444500	But the few people that did believe,
1444500	1449500	the few people that did believe are actually the reason we're Muslim today.
1449500	1453500	Those few people, what is the Quran teaching us about change?
1453500	1456500	Change does not come at the hands of the millions.
1456500	1460500	Change comes at the hands of the few.
1460500	1464500	It is actually individual transformation that is vital.
1464500	1467500	That is the most important objective.
1467500	1472500	Actually the victory from Allah and the millions of people accepting Islam and all that stuff,
1472500	1475500	that's in the hands of Allah.
1475500	1477500	That's in the hands of Allah.
1477500	1481500	But individuals have to experience and the bishans of the prophets
1481500	1484500	is actually to bring about an individual transformation.
1484500	1489500	These ayat are about the process of an individual transformation.
1489500	1492500	How does a person transform?
1492500	1498500	When we learn that properly, then you can see how a family might transform.
1498500	1502500	When you learn that enough, then you can see how a community might transform.
1502500	1506500	It starts like a pebble when you throw it in the water.
1506500	1509500	It's one pebble, but it has ripples and ripples and ripples and ripples.
1509500	1513500	But the first thing is actually the individual transformation, isn't it?
1513500	1515500	That's what this ayat is actually about.
1515500	1520500	How did this transformation actually take place in the hearts of these individuals?
1520500	1522500	It's going to be based on four steps.
1522500	1527500	These are the four steps of the Prophet ﷺ bringing about this transformation that Allah gave him.
1527500	1533500	So if you think about the, especially the last name of Allah, al-Hakim, his wisdom,
1533500	1538500	he decided that this should be the strategy to bring about consistent change.
1538500	1541500	So it begins with yatlu'a alayhim ayatihi.
1541500	1544500	He reads onto them his ayat.
1544500	1548500	And this is probably where we're going to take our discussion today this far.
1548500	1551500	And then we'll do the other three steps tomorrow in shall I complete this.
1551500	1554500	Read, so tada yatlu'a alayhim.
1554500	1559500	We say he narrates the ayat or he reads the ayat onto them.
1559500	1563500	Atilu is used for young animals which follow their mother.
1563500	1566500	Walad ul-Himar, walad ul-Naqqa, they're called tilwining.
1566500	1568500	Wherever the mom goes, the baby follows.
1568500	1573500	You know, some babies are difficult, like Afghan babies, right?
1573500	1577500	They run away from their parents, but some babies are very clingy.
1577500	1579500	Wherever the mom goes, mama, mama, mama, mama.
1579500	1583500	Like they just kind of, you don't even have to put a tracker on them or nothing.
1583500	1586500	It was just automatic magnetic field, right?
1586500	1591500	And some kids, you have to literally tie them up with a, now they come with baby leashes.
1591500	1593500	I've seen those things now, right?
1593500	1596500	So that the kid doesn't, you know, disappear.
1596500	1600500	But when certain animals, they know that if they stray away from the mother, they're going to get killed.
1600500	1603500	So they just stick very close to the mother.
1603500	1605500	They follow her step by step.
1605500	1607500	And those kinds of animals are called tilwan.
1607500	1611500	At-tulawa is the remainder of a thing, meaning what follows behind a thing.
1611500	1613500	Taqiyatu shay'a'amatan.
1613500	1616500	Tattalla is to follow something closely or repeatedly.
1616500	1618500	Tattab'uhu.
1618500	1619500	Allah even says,
1619500	1622500	wa shamsi idha ad-dhuhaha wa al-qamari idha.
1622500	1626500	Tadah, tadah in Arabic, when the moon follows the sun.
1626500	1630500	The moon follows the sun, so the word following is tadah.
1630500	1632500	So what does this word have to do with reading?
1632500	1636500	When someone's reading something, their eyes are following to the next word.
1636500	1640500	You're pronouncing this word, but your eyes are already on the next word.
1640500	1644500	You're following and following and following, and your fingers and your eyes are following the text.
1644500	1648500	And that's actually called tida'wa, to follow.
1648500	1653500	And Allah used this word really interestingly because it's actually a contradiction.
1653500	1659500	Ummiyin means people that were as uneducated and unlettered as when they came out of their mothers.
1659500	1663500	And he's actually a prophet that's among the ummiyin.
1663500	1665500	So how is he reciting something?
1665500	1666500	How is he reading something?
1666500	1672500	Allah has given this messenger the ability to read the word of Allah in a rabbi sense.
1672500	1677500	Meaning that this is not reading from literally a scripture.
1677500	1681500	It's reading from the angel is teaching him how to read.
1681500	1683500	An angel is making him read.
1683500	1688500	And he's actually, instead of following a piece of paper or a piece of leather, following it,
1688500	1692500	he's actually following the instructions of who?
1692500	1694500	Jibril, alayhi salam.
1694500	1698500	So he's actually still following, which is a really powerful expression.
1698500	1699500	Yatlu alayhim.
1699500	1701500	But what is he reciting?
1701500	1704500	Now, if those of you that are a little bit familiar with Arabic, it's actually
1704500	1706500	Yatlu alayhim.
1706500	1708500	The maf'ool bihi comes first.
1708500	1710500	The jarr majroor, mta'adat bel-firil comes second.
1710500	1711500	But this is muqaddam.
1711500	1713500	Now I'll speak in human.
1713500	1720500	What that means is Allah is saying, He, especially on these people, these ummiyin, he recites.
1720500	1728500	Meaning the Quran came especially first targeting these audience from their,
1728500	1734500	so the Quran will use expressions that are used in Arabic by these people in their culture.
1734500	1736500	It'll use sayings that they're used to.
1736500	1739500	It'll use examples that they're used to.
1739500	1741500	It'll use language that they're used to.
1741500	1743500	It's not going to use some high level language.
1743500	1747500	It's going to use the people's language because he's going to recite especially for them.
1747500	1749500	Allah, the owner of all wisdom.
1749500	1751500	Allah has all knowledge.
1751500	1755500	There's no knowledge of physics or chemistry or biology or history or anthropology,
1755500	1757500	any science in the world or beyond the world.
1757500	1760500	There's no knowledge that Allah doesn't have.
1760500	1763500	And you know, the more someone knows, the more complicated their speech becomes.
1763500	1765500	Have you ever tried talking to a PhD?
1765500	1770500	It's not a normal conversation because their vocabulary causes aesthetics, right?
1770500	1777500	When they speak, it's just really hard because they don't know how to come down to the rest of us peasants.
1777500	1780500	They stay up here, right?
1780500	1787500	Allah, knower of all things, you would expect, will speak in the most complicated ways
1787500	1789500	because he's the knower of all things.
1789500	1790500	But what did he do?
1790500	1793500	He decided to speak to the least educated people in the world
1793500	1797500	and then he decided to speak to them in a way that they can understand.
1798500	1803500	And so he sent a messenger whose accent, whose cultural expressions,
1803500	1805500	whose upbringing they're familiar with.
1805500	1809500	So first he chose the teacher that will be the most familiar to them
1809500	1813500	and then he chose his words that would be the easiest for them to understand.
1813500	1814500	Why is this important?
1814500	1817500	Because as you will see in the next ayah tomorrow, inshallah,
1817500	1823500	Allah's plan was nobody should say, my words are too complicated.
1823500	1824500	I don't get it.
1825500	1830500	Nobody should have that excuse because this wasn't sent to scholars, it was sent to who?
1830500	1832500	Umayyin.
1832500	1833500	The Umayyin, you see?
1833500	1835500	So it was meant for everybody.
1835500	1838500	If Umayyin can handle it, anybody can handle it.
1838500	1841500	If they can understand it, what excuse you got left?
1841500	1842500	You see?
1842500	1844500	And what did the Israelites do with their book?
1844500	1845500	No, no, no, no, no.
1845500	1847500	They told the average follower among the Israelites,
1847500	1848500	you can't read the book.
1848500	1849500	No, no, no, it's not for you.
1849500	1850500	You're going to get misguided.
1850500	1851500	Let us read it.
1851500	1853500	We'll tell you what it says.
1853500	1857500	Because if you read it, then you're just going to go to hell.
1857500	1858500	It's not for you.
1858500	1861500	Alhamdulillah, Muslims didn't do that.
1861500	1865500	Tell the average Muslim, no, no, no, don't read the Quran.
1865500	1866500	It's not for you.
1866500	1868500	This is for the scholars.
1868500	1871500	They read it and they'll tell you what it says.
1871500	1872500	Don't try to read it on your own.
1872500	1877500	It's better for you to just listen to some recitation, put it on YouTube and cook your food.
1877500	1878500	Okay?
1878500	1879500	That's for you.
1879500	1882500	Understanding the book, that's just for the scholars.
1882500	1887500	This was something the Israelites did and Alhamdulillah, the Muslims don't even ever think about that.
1887500	1888500	Okay.
1888500	1893500	Anyway, now I'll tell you something amazing.
1893500	1894500	What did I tell you about the Israelites?
1894500	1900500	Some Israelites, they started believing they are special and everybody else is Goyim.
1900500	1901500	Everybody else is Ummi.
1901500	1902500	Okay?
1902500	1903500	I'm going to tell you something.
1903500	1906500	Every time I read these ayat, I feel like it's the first time I'm reading them.
1906500	1907500	This is a long set of ayat.
1907500	1911500	I'm just going to read them and translate them for you and just appreciate what Allah says.
1911500	1912500	This is from Surah Al-Araf.
1912500	1917500	Wa khtarah Musa qalmahu s-sir'ina rajul an-dimiqatina.
1917500	1927500	Allah, Musa al-Aliy salam chose his people, chose 70 people from his people, 70 leaders, to meet with us.
1927500	1931500	So now Musa al-Aliy salam, you remember the story when they worshiped the calf?
1931500	1932500	Right?
1932500	1936500	Musa al-Aliy salam left and then behind him just ended up worshiping the golden calf, right?
1936500	1940500	Now when they did that, Allah wanted to hold them responsible.
1940500	1944500	So Allah said, bring your leaders to me, I will speak to them directly.
1944500	1948500	So now he used to speak to who directly before?
1948500	1949500	Musa.
1949500	1954500	But Allah says, no, I want to speak to your tribe leaders, the elders.
1954500	1957500	So Musa al-Aliy salam chose how many leaders?
1957500	1959500	70, to meet with Allah.
1959500	1961500	Limiqatina for our meeting.
1961500	1965500	So they came to the mountain to meet with Allah.
1965500	1968500	Then the mountain started shaking.
1968500	1973500	So when they took the calf, when the earthquake started rumbling and they're all shaking,
1973500	1976500	Musa is there, 70 leaders are there, they think they're about to die,
1976500	1978500	boulders are falling from the mountain.
1978500	1985500	Musa al-Aliy salam spoke, Allah said, if you had wanted, you would have killed them already.
1985500	1991500	Before we ever came here, you would have killed everybody, you would have killed me too.
1991500	1993500	Why are you shaking it like this?
1993500	1999500	Are you killing us because of what the fools did among us?
1999500	2001500	Is that what you're doing, Ya Rabb?
2001500	2003500	He's in shock and he's asking Allah,
2003500	2007500	Inhiya illa fitna, he goes, no, no, no, this is nothing but a trial.
2007500	2010500	This is nothing but a test that you're doing with us.
2010500	2013500	Tudil lubiha mantasha'u wa tahdi mantasha'u
2013500	2019500	You will allow whoever you want to be misguided because of this test.
2019500	2023500	And you will allow whoever to be guided because of this test.
2023500	2027500	So one of the lessons here, side lesson is when Allah shakes your life up,
2027500	2030500	it will either misguide you or guide you.
2030500	2034500	Some people get their life shakes up and they say, you know what, I used to be a Muslim,
2034500	2037500	but Allah shook my life up, that's it, I don't pray anymore.
2037500	2040500	What's the point? Allah shook my life up, you see.
2040500	2044500	And other people, Allah shakes their life up and they weren't praying before
2044500	2046500	and all of a sudden they're in Sajda.
2046500	2049500	Tudil lubiha mantasha'u wa tahdi mantasha'u
2049500	2051500	With what? With the shaking.
2051500	2054500	Anta wali yuna, you are our protecting friend.
2054500	2056500	Faqfil lana warhamna.
2056500	2059500	Forgive us, show us your love and care.
2059500	2062500	Wa anta qayru l-ghafireen, and you are the best of those who forgives.
2062500	2064500	Who's speaking right now?
2064500	2068500	Musa is speaking, the mountain is shaking, the 70 leaders are with him,
2068500	2070500	he's speaking to Allah and he keeps speaking.
2070500	2073500	Wa qtub lana fi hadhi hid dunya hasana.
2073500	2078500	Please guarantee for us, right for us, in this life, beautiful things,
2078500	2080500	wa fil ahira, and in the next life,
2080500	2083500	inna al-hudna ilayk, I'll come back to this tomorrow.
2083500	2085500	We turn back to you.
2085500	2088500	Hadha yahudu means to turn back. We turn back to you.
2088500	2090500	Meaning we're making Toba to you.
2090500	2093500	We came here asking for forgiveness, me and these 70 leaders.
2093500	2095500	Now Allah will respond.
2095500	2097500	I want you to remember where this is happening.
2097500	2102500	This is Musa and 70 leaders of the Israelites
2102500	2104500	and they have come under the mountain.
2104500	2106500	And later on, some groups of them believed
2106500	2110500	whoever was under the mountain with Musa is forever what?
2110500	2112500	Forever pure everybody else is?
2112500	2114500	Impure, that's the belief they developed.
2114500	2117500	Now this is the Quran's version of the same story.
2117500	2120500	The Quran retelling the story. Listen, now Allah will respond.
2120500	2124500	Allah says, qala aadha bi usibubihi man asha.
2124500	2126500	My punishment?
2126500	2129500	I will strike it to whoever I want.
2129500	2133500	I'll strike my punishment to whoever I want.
2133500	2135500	Did you say you're protected from my punishment?
2135500	2138500	No, you said no. I will strike my punishment down to
2138500	2145500	but my loving care extends to everything.
2145500	2152500	So my punishment is targeted but my rahma is everywhere.
2152500	2155500	My rahma doesn't have to be targeted because it's already everywhere
2155500	2158500	but my punishment is targeted. See the difference in language?
2159500	2163500	So I will write this to those who are watching this.
2176500	2182500	And those who believe in our ayat.
2189500	2195500	Those who are going to follow the messenger,
2195500	2201500	who's the prophet, who is unlettered,
2201500	2207500	the one they find written with them,
2207500	2209500	in the Torah and in the Injil.
2209500	2211500	Meaning Allah is telling them on the mountain,
2211500	2215500	right now you have Torah and later on there will be a prophet
2215500	2217500	who will give you another book called what?
2217500	2222500	Injil and in both of these books you will find that there is a prophet coming.
2222500	2225500	He's a prophet, he's a messenger, he's unlettered
2225500	2227500	and he's mentioned in both of these scriptures
2227500	2231500	and I will guarantee my mercy for you if you follow him.
2233500	2235500	Under the mountain.
2235500	2237500	Under the...
2237500	2240500	When ha'hum anil munkili, that messenger will come,
2240500	2242500	he will tell them to do the right thing
2242500	2244500	and he will stop them from doing the wrong thing
2245500	2249500	and he will make good and pure things for them
2249500	2254500	and he will make filthy things impermissible for them
2254500	2259500	and he will remove from them their burdens
2259500	2264500	and their chains that used to be on them.
2264500	2266500	Meaning Allah is already telling them
2266500	2268500	you will have a life of burdens and chains
2268500	2271500	and those burdens and chains will be removed by who?
2272500	2274500	By the prophet who will come.
2274500	2277500	He will come and he will remove those burdens and chains
2277500	2279500	فَالَّذِينَ آْمَنُوا بِهِ
2279500	2282500	Then those who believe in him, in who?
2282500	2284500	Who's the him here?
2284500	2286500	The Sulla S.
2286500	2287500	وَعَزَّرُواهُ
2287500	2289500	And they support him
2289500	2290500	وَنَّصَرُواهُ
2290500	2291500	And they aid him
2291500	2293500	And they honor him and they aid him
2293500	2295500	وَتَّبَعُ النُورَ اللَّذِيْ اُنْزِلَ معهُ
2295500	2297500	And they follow the light that was sent,
2297500	2300500	that will be sent down with him.
2300500	2302500	What's the light that is sent down with him?
2302500	2303500	The Quran.
2303500	2306500	وَلَا إِكَهُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ
2306500	2308500	Those are the people that are successful.
2309500	2314500	This is a conversation about the Annabi Al-Ummi
2314500	2320500	that was had first with Musa and his 70 followers.
2320500	2322500	One of the earliest teachings
2322500	2326500	to the followers of Musa, the Bani Israel,
2326500	2329500	and then it was reinforced in which book?
2329500	2331500	It wasn't just in Torah, it's where else?
2331500	2333500	Indeed, it was given to who?
2333500	2335500	That's why Isa says in the Quran
2335500	2339500	وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَاْتِيمٍ بَعْدِسْمُهُ أَحْمَدْ
2339500	2341500	I have come to give you good news of a messenger
2341500	2343500	who's coming after me, whose name is Ahmed,
2343500	2345500	which is in the previous Surah.
2345500	2348500	Okay, this is in Surah al-Saf.
2348500	2352500	So Musa is telling of the coming of Muhammad,
2352500	2357500	and Isa, Al-Islam, is telling of the coming of Muhammad,
2357500	2360500	so according to that, both the Christian, the Jewish peoples,
2360500	2363500	and their scripture, the ones who know among them
2363500	2366500	will know that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah,
2366500	2368500	salallahu alayhi wa sallam.
2368500	2372500	So when he says he sent among the Ummi-een a messenger,
2372500	2375500	people who were loyal to the scripture would say,
2375500	2377500	among the Ummi-een?
2377500	2380500	Hey, wait, among the Ummi-een?
2380500	2384500	Every generation of the Israelites from Musa, al-Ali-salaam,
2384500	2388500	later on in their prophets, like all the Israelites,
2388500	2391500	Suleiman, Dawood, every one of them follow Torah,
2391500	2394500	and that means every one of them knows who's coming.
2394500	2397500	Muhammad, al-Salaam, is coming, they're waiting, they're waiting,
2397500	2399500	they're waiting, they're waiting, all these generations, they're waiting.
2399500	2401500	And Allah even says in Surah al-Baqarah,
2401500	2403500	that the Israelites who lived in the region,
2403500	2406500	sometimes they would get into a fight with the Mushrikun of Makkah.
2406500	2410500	And the Mushrikun of Makkah were better fighters, so they would win.
2410500	2412500	And when they would win, you know what they would say?
2412500	2415500	Wa ka'alum bin qablu yas tafti'un a'alalladheena kafaru.
2415500	2417500	Whenever they would get beat up, they would say,
2417500	2419500	oh yeah, you won this time.
2419500	2421500	But we've been studying.
2421500	2425500	The last prophet is coming any day now, and once he comes,
2425500	2428500	we're gonna get you so good.
2430500	2432500	They used to say this whenever they lost a fight.
2432500	2434500	It's in the Qur'an, Surah al-Baqarah.
2434500	2436500	And then when analysis,
2436500	2438500	falamma ja'a, hum ma'arafu,
2438500	2440500	and when whatever they already knew came,
2440500	2442500	they denied it.
2442500	2444500	They denied it.
2444500	2446500	So they actually used to use,
2446500	2448500	is tiftaah of the coming of the prophet,
2448500	2450500	salallahu alayhi wa salam, to the Qur'an.
2450500	2452500	They used to say to them, by the way,
2452500	2454500	all the signs are here.
2454500	2456500	Oh, he's coming.
2456500	2458500	Our wa la maa, give qabba now it is, anytime now.
2458500	2460500	He's so coming right now.
2460500	2462500	And then he came.
2462500	2464500	Now this is yatlu alayhim.
2464500	2468500	Now, yatlu, what do we learn from yatlu?
2468500	2470500	This is really important.
2470500	2472500	The Bible will tell us of the prophet,
2472500	2474500	salallahu alayhim, whatever is left of it,
2474500	2476500	that Allah says about him,
2476500	2478500	and what's left of the Bible,
2478500	2480500	I will put my words in his mouth.
2480500	2482500	See the taura,
2482500	2485500	the taura is a collection of divine teachings,
2485500	2487500	but it's not precisely the word of God,
2487500	2489500	not even according to the rabbis.
2489500	2491500	It's a collection of memories and teachings.
2491500	2493500	The closest thing that we have to that
2493500	2495500	is something like samah hadith,
2495500	2497500	or some opinions. In fact,
2497500	2499500	it's a combination of what they consider the word of Allah,
2499500	2502500	and hadith, and tafsir, and fiqh,
2502500	2504500	and history, all in one.
2504500	2507500	You know how in the tafsir of the Quran,
2507500	2509500	you have the ayah and then you have the commentary?
2509500	2511500	And taura, where does the ayah end
2511500	2513500	and where does the commentary begin?
2513500	2515500	They don't make a distinction.
2515500	2516500	So they can't tell.
2516500	2518500	They can't tell. That's what happened over time.
2518500	2520500	Maybe after I gotta finish my train of thought,
2520500	2522500	I'll take your question.
2522500	2524500	But then Allah gave, and this is why Allah says,
2525500	2526500	or
2528500	2530500	The Quran confirms what they have in front of them,
2530500	2532500	because what they have in front of them is a huge tradition.
2532500	2535500	The mishnah, the taura, is a massive tradition.
2535500	2537500	And then the talmud, it's all mixed together.
2537500	2539500	And this is not because they made changes to the word of Allah.
2539500	2540500	That's a separate problem.
2540500	2542500	Allah did not give them a word
2542500	2544500	that was memorized the way that the Quran is memorized.
2544500	2546500	But they knew a prophet is coming,
2546500	2547500	who about him said,
2547500	2549500	I will put my words in his mouth.
2549500	2551500	Meaning, it won't even be his own words.
2551500	2553500	He'll be following the words that are given to him.
2554500	2556500	Yatlu alayhim a'ayati.
2556500	2557500	Okay, so now,
2558500	2560500	if I'm speaking to you right now,
2561500	2564500	imagine, so, I mean, I can give you a German example,
2564500	2567500	because I don't know any German, except for ya.
2568500	2569500	And shnel.
2569500	2570500	But,
2575500	2577500	it works in many situations.
2578500	2580500	It's like in traffic.
2580500	2582500	Like, you know, that's it.
2585500	2586500	Anyway,
2587500	2588500	so,
2588500	2591500	most of the time, okay, so if your child,
2592500	2593500	sitting at dinner,
2593500	2597500	your child memorized some poetry in German
2598500	2600500	and sat there and started reciting that poetry,
2601500	2603500	would you believe that that's your own child's words,
2603500	2605500	even though there's no paper in front of them?
2605500	2607500	Can you tell that's not your child's words?
2607500	2609500	Because you know how your child speaks.
2609500	2611500	In fact, even if your parents started doing that,
2611500	2612500	you'd be like,
2612500	2614500	where did you get this?
2614500	2616500	Why did you do this?
2616500	2618500	And if you really think that's them speaking,
2618500	2619500	then you contact the Imam
2619500	2621500	because there's a Jinn possession or something.
2622500	2625500	Because when someone speaks out of their normal,
2625500	2630500	you can tell they're not really speaking, they're reading.
2630500	2633500	The Prophet's voice to them has lived among the people
2633500	2635500	the Prophet's voice to them has lived among them
2635500	2637500	so they know how he speaks.
2637500	2641500	But now, he's not speaking, he is what?
2642500	2645500	Reciting, following words that are given to him.
2645500	2649500	Can they tell this is a clear distinction between his speech
2649500	2653500	and the words that are coming out of his mouth are clearly not his?
2653500	2654500	This is why they said,
2654500	2656500	why is he talking like this?
2656500	2657500	What is this?
2658500	2659500	Is this,
2659500	2661500	this is being dictated to him?
2661500	2662500	Where'd you get these words from?
2662500	2663500	Is this poetry?
2663500	2664500	What is that?
2664500	2665500	Is that mad?
2665500	2667500	Man, it has such an effect on me.
2667500	2669500	Is this some kind of magic or something?
2670500	2671500	Whoever,
2671500	2673500	whoever listens to this feels like they got possessed.
2673500	2675500	So maybe he's possessed too.
2675500	2677500	They came up with all these theories
2677500	2680500	because they knew this is clearly not his own speech.
2680500	2682500	There's an author by the name of Basim Sayyih,
2682500	2684500	whose also, his book has also been translated to English,
2684500	2690500	who did a thorough study of thousands and thousands of hadith
2690500	2691500	of the Prophet's voice to them,
2691500	2693500	and the speech pattern in hadith,
2693500	2694500	because everybody has a speech pattern.
2694500	2696500	If you listen to my speeches and you transcribe them,
2696500	2699500	there's going to be a lot of right, right?
2699500	2701500	Right, so there's a lot of right in my,
2701500	2703500	not enough left, a lot of right.
2703500	2706500	But that's just my speech pattern.
2706500	2709500	And the Prophet himself also has a what?
2709500	2710500	A speech pattern.
2710500	2713500	And they did an analysis of the speech pattern of all the hadith
2713500	2715500	and the speech pattern of the Quran,
2715500	2717500	and it's clearly two distinct speakers.
2717500	2719500	They're not the same speaker.
2719500	2722500	Just from a speech pattern point of view, right?
2722500	2724500	So, yatlu a'lai him a'ayati, the wording is not his,
2724500	2726500	it is extremely precise.
2726500	2728500	Also means there's no compromise in the meaning.
2728500	2730500	You know, if I'm talking to you,
2730500	2732500	I look first at how old you are,
2732500	2734500	or what your question is,
2734500	2736500	and how many people are listening,
2736500	2737500	is this being recorded or not?
2737500	2738500	Should I completely go off,
2738500	2740500	or should I just kind of keep my answer contained?
2740500	2743500	I have to read the situation before I open my mouth.
2743500	2746500	We're aware of who we're talking to.
2746500	2748500	But the Prophet, peace be upon him,
2748500	2750500	is talking to enemies that hate him,
2750500	2753500	and he's not, he cannot consider how to speak to them
2753500	2756500	because the words are not his, the words are coming from Allah,
2756500	2758500	and they may be even more offensive
2758500	2760500	to the person standing in front of them,
2760500	2762500	but it doesn't matter, he's going to say them
2762500	2764500	because they are being dictated to him.
2764500	2765500	Yatlu a'lai him a'ayati.
2765500	2768500	The Messenger, peace be upon him, is actually humble.
2768500	2770500	He's fi'l ummiyine.
2770500	2772500	He comes from a humble beginning.
2772500	2774500	And he's a slave of Allah,
2774500	2776500	and the words are the words of a king.
2776500	2778500	So there's an immediate contrast.
2778500	2781500	The speaker is at the lowest level of humility,
2781500	2784500	but the words are in the highest level of pride
2784500	2786500	because they are the words of Allah,
2786500	2787500	the owner of all pride.
2787500	2789500	He's al-Mutakabbir.
2789500	2792500	Al-Mutakabbir is a terrible quality for a person.
2792500	2795500	But al-Mutakabbir is one of the attributes of Allah
2795500	2797500	because he deserves it, he is the great one.
2797500	2799500	He speaks from the perspective of being great.
2799500	2801500	So the humility of the Messenger
2801500	2803500	is combined with the greatness of the word of Allah,
2803500	2805500	which is an amazing thing because
2805500	2808500	we have to present the word of Allah with its greatness,
2808500	2812500	but we still have to carry ourselves with humility.
2812500	2815500	The problem happens when we speak about the word of Allah with greatness
2815500	2818500	and we start thinking because of that we're kind of great also.
2818500	2820500	We're not, we're still slaves of Allah.
2820500	2824500	Then it is meant to be heard like a royal decree, actually.
2824500	2827500	It's being recited word for word from the king,
2827500	2831500	so you get this appreciation that it's coming from a higher source.
2831500	2833500	And then of course it's an open pronouncement.
2833500	2836500	This is the most encouraging thing actually in these ayat.
2836500	2840500	And that is that this is an open announcement to even the least learned.
2840500	2843500	In other words, it's al-Umiyin.
2843500	2848500	And Allah decided to give his revelations to the Ummiyin first
2848500	2852500	to open up this invitation so no one gets to say,
2852500	2854500	this is not for me.
2854500	2857500	Because it's for them, but then everybody's above that.
2857500	2858500	So it's for everyone.
2858500	2860500	The Qur'an was meant to be accessible by everyone.
2860500	2862500	You know, one of the common words for the Qur'an is
2862500	2864500	Inzal, Anzal al-Quran.
2864500	2865500	Right?
2865500	2867500	So, Inna Anzalnaahu Fi-Layda Til Qadr.
2867500	2870500	Nuzul in Arabic doesn't just mean to come down.
2870500	2872500	Inzal also means to make something accessible.
2872500	2875500	And for centuries the Bible wasn't accessible.
2875500	2877500	For most of the Israelites, the Torah wasn't accessible.
2877500	2879500	Religious teachings weren't accessible.
2879500	2882500	The teachings of Ibrahim, al-Azim, were lost to history
2882500	2883500	and they were not accessible.
2883500	2886500	The truth about the people of the cave was no longer accessible.
2886500	2888500	The stories had been changed.
2888500	2890500	Human beings didn't have access to it.
2890500	2893500	And Allah made the Qur'an by definition accessible.
2893500	2895500	Everybody can access it.
2895500	2897500	Everybody can engage with an open invitation.
2897500	2900500	It's one of the most revolutionary features of the Qur'an.
2900500	2903500	And before I leave you, I'm going to tell you my favorite part
2903500	2906500	because we need to finish this part of the discussion.
2906500	2908500	And then I'll open it up for Qay'a, inshallah.
2908500	2910500	And that is, what does ayameen?
2910500	2911500	Yatlu alayhim, ayatihi.
2911500	2915500	They translate, he reads on to them his verses or his revelations,
2915500	2917500	which is okay.
2917500	2920500	But let's dig into the word ayah a little bit.
2920500	2922500	I really want you to appreciate what the word ayah is
2922500	2925500	because it's one of the most important terms in the Qur'an.
2925500	2927500	And I'll explain what I've written here.
2927500	2931500	Ayah means the specificness of something.
2931500	2933500	So from its origin, ayatur-rajul,
2933500	2935500	I'm talking exactly about that person.
2935500	2938500	So something that's very exact can also mean ayah.
2938500	2940500	So Allah is not speaking in ambiguous terms.
2940500	2943500	Allah is speaking in very exact, precise terms.
2943500	2947500	Ta'ayyah, or ta'ayyahu, to direct a course.
2947500	2949500	Meaning ta'ayyah, actually it's coming later,
2949500	2952500	means Qasada, something that has a purpose.
2952500	2954500	Like if I head towards that door,
2954500	2956500	my body turns towards that door, I keep taking steps.
2956500	2959500	Ta'ayyah, ta'ayyah al-bab.
2959500	2962500	He headed towards the door he intended to get to the door.
2962500	2965500	The ayat aren't just interesting in bits of information.
2965500	2967500	They are leading you in a direction.
2967500	2968500	They have a purpose.
2968500	2971500	So it's driven by a purpose.
2971500	2973500	Then the word ayah comes from
2973500	2975500	kharajal qawmu bi-ayatihim.
2975500	2977500	When the Arabs used to travel in the desert,
2977500	2981500	and they would start a little fire and cook some food.
2981500	2983500	And then when they're done, they pick up their plates
2983500	2987500	and their forks and whatever they eat with the meat.
2987500	2989500	They leave the bones, they leave the burnt wood,
2989500	2992500	they leave the ashes, and they pick up all the valuable things,
2992500	2993500	and they leave.
2993500	2995500	But when somebody else comes, they just see the burnt wood
2995500	2998500	and the ashes, but they don't see anything valuable.
2998500	3000500	So they say kharajal qawmu bi-ayatihim,
3000500	3003500	the people before, they left with all the valuable things.
3003500	3005500	They left nothing of value behind.
3005500	3006500	What is an ayah?
3006500	3008500	Something of value.
3008500	3012500	Something Allah, He's reciting valuable things to them.
3012500	3015500	And by the way, Allah says there's an ayah in the mountain,
3015500	3018500	there's an ayah inside you, there's an ayah inside the sky,
3018500	3019500	there's an ayah in the bird.
3019500	3021500	What does that tell you about everything?
3021500	3024500	Everything according to this deen has what?
3024500	3025500	Everything has value.
3025500	3026500	Nothing is purposeless.
3026500	3028500	Everything has meaning.
3028500	3030500	It's not a meaningless existence.
3030500	3031500	You know?
3031500	3035500	Al-istifham, the word ayyi actually means what?
3035500	3036500	What kind?
3036500	3037500	Curiosity.
3037500	3042500	The word ayah actually embeds the meaning of something that inspires curiosity.
3042500	3045500	That you should hear the ayah and say,
3045500	3047500	I wonder what I can learn from that?
3047500	3049500	I wonder what it means?
3049500	3051500	And ayyi is actually for atta'ajj,
3051500	3053500	which is already covered in qasad.
3053500	3054500	So atta'ajj means amazement.
3054500	3059500	The Arabic used to say ayyi rajul or ayyi waladz or ayyi mar'a,
3059500	3064500	which means what a man, what a child, what a woman, ayyi kitab,
3064500	3066500	what an amazing book.
3066500	3070500	So ayyi was used as an expression of amazement.
3070500	3073500	And the ayat are supposed to bring about an amazement.
3073500	3075500	Like what an amazing thing Allah has said.
3075500	3078500	An nida wa'tanbihi li'l qareeb duna al-ba'eed.
3078500	3082500	Ayah ayyi is also used for, it's actually similar to English.
3082500	3085500	Ay man, ay, ayyu.
3085500	3088500	When you say ay, what are you actually doing?
3088500	3090500	You're calling someone close.
3090500	3093500	And ayyi was actually used, ayyi rajul was also used for ya'arajul,
3093500	3095500	meaning come here for closeness.
3095500	3098500	Meaning the ayat are also calling you.
3098500	3101500	They're also Allah calling you close to yourself.
3101500	3103500	Then it's an alama.
3103500	3106500	Alama means it's a sign for something.
3106500	3109500	And that's a very common transition, ayat or signs, right?
3109500	3111500	Now the purpose of a sign is what?
3111500	3114500	The purpose of a sign is to give you direction.
3114500	3116500	The sign says take this exit for the street,
3116500	3119500	that tells you here's the sign, here's the exit, right?
3119500	3123500	So the purpose of a sign is to guide you to a destination.
3123500	3125500	When Allah says he recites the ayat,
3125500	3129500	he gives you the signs that guide you to your destination.
3129500	3131500	And what's that destination?
3131500	3133500	Anna ila rabbika al-muntaha.
3133500	3135500	The final destination is towards your Rabb.
3135500	3137500	You're going to meet with Allah, whether you like it or not,
3137500	3140500	whether you intend to or not, you're going to meet with Allah.
3140500	3143500	If you want to meet him the right way, this is the right way.
3143500	3145500	This is the right way to meet with Allah.
3145500	3151500	And then, iya nabt wa iya uhu pusnu wa zahruhu.
3151500	3153500	This is actually really cool.
3153500	3156500	Iya in Arabic comes from the same word as ayah.
3156500	3159500	Actually means beauty and blooming.
3159500	3163500	Like when a flower blossoms, it's actually called iya ad nabt.
3163500	3166500	So the ayat are actually something beautiful.
3166500	3169500	And the more you ponder them, the more they blossom,
3169500	3171500	the more they blossom.
3171500	3173500	That's inside of the word ayah.
3173500	3175500	And iyi, I didn't mention iyi.
3175500	3177500	iyi is actually naam.
3177500	3180500	In Arabic, you have heard of the word naam before?
3180500	3182500	Naam means what?
3182500	3185500	Yeah. Okay, good.
3185500	3190500	Naam, there's another word in Arabic for yes, which is iyi.
3190500	3194500	So if somebody says, hey, did you go to this program?
3194500	3197500	iyi is the same as naam.
3197500	3200500	Naam, I'm agree. Absolutely yes.
3200500	3203500	Which means it is the yes of conviction.
3203500	3206500	The ayah will lead to conviction.
3206500	3209500	The ayah leads to absolute certainty.
3209500	3211500	Yatlua a'aihim a'atii.
3211500	3214500	And then, an mu'atadaan yakuna qaaman anything that comes from this root
3214500	3216500	is actually supposed to be something that stays.
3216500	3217500	It's permanent.
3217500	3218500	It's not a fad.
3218500	3220500	It doesn't go away.
3220500	3223500	It's not like Allah will send His ayat and they will disappear.
3223500	3226800	They are permanent decrease from Allah. That's all inside the word Aya.
3227820	3234540	Allah gave us something of meaning, something of purpose, something of wonder, something that calls us directly, something that inspires curiosity,
3235040	3241960	something that gives us conviction, something that is beautiful, something that blossoms and the messenger will recite this onto the people and it will open up their mind.
3241960	3244920	It will make them thoughtful, beautiful people.
3244920	3248000	Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi. That's the first step. And
3248820	3251320	to end this part of it,
3251480	3259540	if you were just listening to something, like if you just change radio stations or you open up a random TikTok video or whatever,
3259540	3264720	you're listening to something, does it necessarily mean that you are seriously learning?
3265880	3267880	No, it just means you're exposed.
3268280	3274440	If you overhear something, you got exposed, but that doesn't mean you're sitting there taking notes. You're just overheard.
3275800	3278920	Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi is actually not education.
3279920	3285120	He's just reading all onto, he's sitting, he's standing in a marketplace reading the ayat. Is everybody paying attention?
3285600	3286660	No.
3286660	3291000	He's speaking to the Quraysh reciting the ayat. Does everybody's like, let me listen carefully? No.
3291800	3299000	They're being exposed even though they're not paying attention or learning or whatever. Some people started listening.
3299000	3306280	Some people became interested. Some people barely heard anything. Some people hearted and got annoyed, but everybody hears it, right?
3306400	3312740	The first step that was given to the Prophet's life for them is make sure every one of these people hears it.
3313720	3319280	Just read it onto them, expose them to it. Let them react to it. Let them react to it with hate.
3319440	3325080	Let them react to it with ignorance. Let them react to it with dismissing. Let them react to it with curiosity.
3325360	3328600	That's not up to you. Your first job is what? Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi?
3329360	3331920	Ayatihi, this is the part that makes me mad.
3332600	3337760	It makes me mad because born and raised in a Muslim family and much of the Muslim world,
3338520	3340600	when I started learning about the Qur'an,
3341440	3347200	actually understanding, even at a basic level, what it says, I was 19 years old and it made me really angry.
3347520	3350520	How come I was Muslim for 19 years?
3351720	3353360	And
3353360	3355360	nobody told me what the Qur'an says.
3356400	3358400	Like, I'm Muslim. I
3359360	3361000	should know.
3361040	3364560	At least I should know what it says from the beginning to the end.
3365240	3369640	I should know what it says. Nobody did Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.
3371800	3374160	Nobody read the ayahs to me. Like, I didn't know.
3374800	3378400	Then I felt like, do other people, am I the only one who like,
3379120	3381560	nobody read the ayahs? Let me ask around.
3382160	3387880	You do the one of the most sad service you can do, go to any Muslim country, any Muslim community and ask the average Muslim,
3387880	3389880	how much of the Qur'an have you?
3390280	3395200	Forget read, because reading is extra work. How much of the Qur'an was read to you?
3395640	3400040	So that you can understand it. Because if you say have you read, then you have to do the work.
3400040	3404960	But here, who's doing the work? The Prophet's doing the work and people who interrogate from the Prophet's,
3404960	3408440	they're supposed to, the ones who know should read it to the ones who don't know, isn't it?
3409400	3412880	So and if we don't know, then we become the ummiyeen.
3413600	3419200	And the ones who know have to follow the sunnah of the Prophet's, so I said, and do what? Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.
3419240	3424280	So I asked, so how many of you heard the Qur'an being explained like, even at a basic level?
3425160	3434360	Like, Baqarah, I don't know, An-Imran, Resah, Ma'idah, An-Aam, A'raf maybe, Toba, An-Anfal Toba, Yunus, Mood, Yusuf, anything?
3434360	3436920	Anything? And you're like, nobody.
3438120	3442000	Nobody read the ayahs to me. Nobody talked me through the ayahs.
3442720	3445440	I didn't hear it. Isn't this something that's supposed to be heard?
3445440	3447440	Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.
3447680	3451680	Right? Is this thing, they should read the Qur'an or they should hear the Qur'an?
3452720	3454640	This is about hearing, right?
3456040	3459680	And this feels to me like disappeared from the ummah.
3460640	3463040	This disappeared. You know what took its place?
3463400	3469120	The recitation of the Qur'an in beautiful voices, millions and millions and millions of listeners around the world
3469760	3473360	are listening to it. But is that Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi?
3473840	3477840	No, because you're not listening to it and saying, this is giving me direction.
3477840	3481280	You're not wondering about it. You're not being brought close.
3481280	3485280	You're not reaching conviction. It's not making you think there's a direction here.
3485280	3489280	This is a sign toward something. It's beautiful divine sounds for Barakah.
3490480	3492640	And those beautiful sounds were supposed to mean something.
3493440	3496480	That would have been Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.
3497440	3502080	This is our first failure. When we say, the ummah is going in a bad direction, what do we do?
3502160	3506960	Well, the Prophet was given a formula. Here's step one, but I want step 17.
3506960	3512160	No, step one, Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.
3512160	3518000	Just that, I would imagine if I can leave a contribution behind,
3518000	3522640	my contribution would be that any of you that have been listening to my work,
3522640	3525200	that I've been trying to do for the last 20 or so years,
3526160	3528960	that you become people that do this.
3529760	3535120	And even if you do it among your friends or among your siblings or just among your children,
3535120	3539680	but you become the continuation of what the Prophet started when Allah said,
3539680	3542640	Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi. Just that.
3542640	3547600	Just that. At least expose them. At least they should hear what Allah says.
3547600	3552480	At least that much. And then we take the next steps after that.
3552480	3556880	InshaAllah, ta'ala. So I'm going to end our session for today here at Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.
3557840	3561120	And talk about the next steps tomorrow, inshaAllah.
3561120	3563760	But I'll open it up for any questions you guys might have.
3565360	3569200	Assalamu alaikum everyone. There are almost 50,000 students around the world
3569200	3573600	that are interested on top of the students we have in studying the Qur'an and its meanings
3573600	3576400	and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.
3576400	3578800	And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive.
3578800	3583520	So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our sponsorship page.
3583520	3586400	I appreciate it so much. And pray that Allah gives our mission success
3586400	3590720	and we're able to share the meanings of the Qur'an and the beauty of it the world over.
