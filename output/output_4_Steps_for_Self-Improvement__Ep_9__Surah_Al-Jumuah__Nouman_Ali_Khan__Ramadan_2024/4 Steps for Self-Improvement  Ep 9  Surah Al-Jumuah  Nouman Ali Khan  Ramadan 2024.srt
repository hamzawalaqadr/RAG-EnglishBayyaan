1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Isn't this something that's supposed to be heard?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Yatlu a'adayhim a'ayati?

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,000
You're not wondering about it.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,500
You're not being brought close.

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
You're not reaching conviction.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,000
This is our first failure.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
When we say,

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, the ummah is going in a bad direction.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,500
What do we do?

10
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Well, the prophet was given a formula.

11
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Here's step one.

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,500
But I want step 17.

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,500
No.

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Step one.

15
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Yatlu a'adayhim a'ayati.

16
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
The Prophet

17
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,500
So we did me and Finn,

18
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
Fee and Min.

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But I will tell you now a little bit about the...

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
I'll introduce this now,

21
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
but we'll go into detail tomorrow,

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
inshallah.

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And that is

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,500
that Allah chose a nation

25
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,000
since the time of Musa A.S.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,500
He chose a nation to be the carriers of His word.

27
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
That was the sons of Israel.

28
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
He chose them and he gave them his book,

29
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
at Ta'urat.

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,500
And they were chosen and given preference

31
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
over all other nations in the world.

32
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
This is what the Quran itself tells us.

33
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Okay?

34
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
We fadladnaakum ale ala alameen.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We gave you preference over all other nations.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,500
No other nation had this many prophets.

37
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
No other nation had this many chances

38
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
to live by and demonstrate the truth of Allah's book.

39
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Over time,

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,500
not all the Israelites,

41
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
but a group among them,

42
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
developed a certain kind of superiority complex.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay?

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,500
Now this is really important.

45
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,000
We hate it

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,500
when somebody quotes something from the Quran

47
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
and says,

48
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
all these Muslims, this is what they believe.

49
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
You see?

50
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
It says, like, some of our, you know,

51
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
back home,

52
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
ah, these Muslims.

53
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Look at what it says in their Quran.

54
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
It says, kill them wherever you find them.

55
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
This is what they believe.

56
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
They want to kill you wherever they find you.

57
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
It says it right here in your book.

58
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
We hate that because we know

59
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
that's,

60
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
you're taking it out of context.

61
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
You don't know what that means.

62
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
And you could have just asked one of us,

63
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
but you would rather quote something out of place,

64
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
and then we get really offended.

65
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
We shouldn't do that to their books.

66
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Because we hate it ourselves.

67
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
We shouldn't take one quote from the Bible here,

68
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
one quote from the Bible saying,

69
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
look at what these people believe.

70
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Look at what's in their book.

71
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Look at, no, no, that's not fair.

72
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
That's not fair.

73
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
And when some Muslims do something bad,

74
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
and they say all Muslims are like this,

75
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
we hate it.

76
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,500
But if some Jews or some Christians do something wrong,

77
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
and we take the sum and say what?

78
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
All Christians are like this.

79
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
We hate it.

80
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Is that justice?

81
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Is that fair?

82
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Is that a double standard?

83
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
We should be people of justice.

84
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
The Quran is actually extremely just

85
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
in the way it deals with the Christians and the Jews.

86
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
And our relationship with the Jews

87
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
and our relationship with the Christians

88
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
is very interesting in the Quran.

89
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
It's not one relationship.

90
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
It's multiple relationships.

91
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
It's not one relationship.

92
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
On the one hand,

93
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,500
one of the audiences of the Quran are the rabbis

94
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
and the priests.

95
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
That's one specific audience.

96
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
They're called Ahlul Kitab in the Quran.

97
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Allah talks to them and says what?

98
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Ahlul Kitab.

99
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
And that's referring not to all Christians

100
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
and all Jews.

101
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Who's it referring to?

102
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
The rabbis and the priests.

103
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Our religion, the book,

104
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
targeted the most knowledgeable people

105
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
in their religion

106
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
and had a conversation with them.

107
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
That's number one.

108
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Another audience in the Quran

109
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
is the historical Jews

110
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
and the historical Christians,

111
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
some of them who made some very serious mistakes.

112
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
And he criticizes the some of them

113
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
that made very serious mistakes.

114
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
By the way, in Islamic history,

115
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
since the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

116
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
are there some Muslims and Muslim nations

117
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
and governments that made very serious mistakes?

118
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Yeah.

119
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Now, though, what we like to do

120
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
when we talk about Islamic history,

121
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
we talk about Salah-e-Din.

122
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Like, we talk about Rasul Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

123
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Abu Bakr, Omar,

124
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Othman, Ali-Radiullah, and Amr.

125
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Okay, golden years, fast forward.

126
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Salah-e-Din, fast forward right now.

127
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
And all the chapters of Islamic history

128
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
that are not so glorious,

129
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
where we did not so nice things,

130
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
where we may have committed some part of genocide,

131
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
or we may have colluded and done something wrong,

132
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
we kind of

133
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
skip those chapters and say,

134
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
You're unmar.

135
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
You say, beautiful.

136
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I have to get the unmar back.

137
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
And you're like,

138
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Yes, unmar.

139
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Even though you don't...

140
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Can you tell me the history of the Oman

141
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
the last 200 years?

142
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 years?

143
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Can you tell me?

144
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Can you tell me what the rule was like?

145
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Can you tell me what...

146
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
You know, no, no, no, but overall, we were good.

147
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Overall, they were bad.

148
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Overall, we were good.

149
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
You know what that is?

150
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
That's delusional thinking.

151
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
And that's dishonesty.

152
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
That's intellectual dishonesty.

153
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
The Israelites had an issue.

154
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Some of them.

155
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,500
They looked at their history and only focused on the good parts.

156
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Oh, look, we are the people of Ibrahim,

157
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
we're the people of Musa,

158
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
we're the people of this,

159
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
we're the people of this.

160
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Allah spoke to us on the mountain.

161
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
We're so special because of this reason,

162
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,500
this reason, this reason, this reason, this reason.

163
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
And what did they skip?

164
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
The embarrassing parts of their history.

165
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
They skipped those parts.

166
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Not all of them did this,

167
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
but some of them did this.

168
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,500
By the way, does that sound like a familiar disease?

169
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
The Muslims have selective citation of history?

170
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Did we develop our psychology based on selective chapters of history?

171
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Yeah.

172
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Why is the Prophet telling us you're going to become like them?

173
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Same.

174
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
And then what does Allah do in the Quran?

175
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Especially in Surat Al-Baqara.

176
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,500
He highlights a part of their history that they don't like to talk about.

177
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
He highlighted the ugly chapters of Israelite history.

178
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
And that even said,

179
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Well, ya'af, anka thir, and by the way,

180
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
there's a lot that I'm skipping.

181
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
There's a lot more,

182
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,500
but this should be enough for you to get the point.

183
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
There's a lot more dirty laundry.

184
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
But why was Allah doing this?

185
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
It was not to humiliate the Israelites.

186
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
It was actually to teach Muslims something,

187
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
which is what?

188
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Be honest with yourselves.

189
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
And then the other part of the Israelite history,

190
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
in the Quran,

191
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
so we've got the rabbis and the priests being talked to,

192
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
selective history being addressed.

193
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Among some of them,

194
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
the third, there are heroes in Israelite history.

195
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
That are our heroes.

196
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Not just their prophets.

197
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
وَكَأَيْمِ النَّبِيْنْ قَاتَلَمَ عَهُرِ بِيْوْنَا كَثِيرْ

198
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
When Muslims were about to go into the battle of Uhud,

199
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
you know who their inspiration was in the Quran?

200
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Those who fought alongside the Israelite prophets.

201
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Who were they?

202
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
The Israelites.

203
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
The Jews of that time.

204
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
They were be considered the Muslims of that time.

205
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
And they are our inspiration in the Quran.

206
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Actually.

207
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
So what I'm saying is,

208
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
we think that the Quran paints one stroke,

209
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
one picture of who the Jews are,

210
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,500
one picture of who the Christians are in the Quran.

211
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
That is absolutely not the case.

212
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,500
In some places of certain groups, highly critical.

213
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,500
In some places of certain groups, praising.

214
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
And in the current times,

215
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
the Muslims would be like,

216
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
No, we know something about the historical Jews.

217
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Some of them were praiseworthy.

218
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Some of them were criticism worthy.

219
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
But what about the Jews we're living with in Medina?

220
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
What about them?

221
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Allah says,

222
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
وَمَنْهُمْ مَنْ اِنْتَ مَنْهُبِقِنْطَارِنْ يُؤْدِّهِ لَيْكَ

223
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,500
وَمَنْهُمْ مَنْ اِنْتَ مَنْهُبِدِيْنَارِ لَيْوَدِّهِ لَيْكَ

224
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Among them are people,

225
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
if you trusted them with piles and piles of wealth,

226
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
they will give it back to you 100%.

227
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
And among them, there are those,

228
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
if you give them even one penny,

229
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
they will not give it back to you.

230
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
And the second group,

231
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
so the first one,

232
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,500
and by the way, he mentioned the honest ones first.

233
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,500
He prioritized the honest ones.

234
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
He even said about them,

235
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
وَمَا يَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلَنْ يُكْفَرُواهُ

236
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
The good deeds they do, they will not be denied of them.

237
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
This is Quran.

238
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
This is Quran.

239
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
And then he said,

240
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
and the ones that will not even give you back one penny,

241
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
he said one thing about them.

242
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
He said,

243
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
ذَالِكَ بِأَنْ نَقَالُوا لَيْسَ عَلَيْسَ عَلَيْنَ فِي الْأُمْمِيِّينَ سَبِيلَ

244
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
That's because they said,

245
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
when it comes to the J...

246
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
الْأُمْمِيِّينَ

247
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
You heard the word,

248
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
الْأُمْمِيِّينَ لَيْسَ عَلَيْنَ فِي الْأُمْمِيِّينَ سَبِيلَ

249
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Among...

250
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,500
When it comes to these uneducated people,

251
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
these un-blessed people,

252
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
we don't owe them anything.

253
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
So among them, an extreme group came,

254
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
not all of them,

255
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
but an extreme group came within them,

256
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
and what beliefs did they develop?

257
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
They developed a belief that if you steal from,

258
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
they considered the rest of the world impure.

259
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Najas.

260
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Okay, the ones that were pure are the...

261
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
These realites, everybody else's?

262
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Najas.

263
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
And since they're najas,

264
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
if a najas steals from me,

265
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
if an impure one steals from me,

266
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
they better pay me back.

267
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
But if I steal from them,

268
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
I don't have to pay them back.

269
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
And they developed that mentality.

270
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
And the Qur'an came in what?

271
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Attack that mentality.

272
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Those are the ones that can't be trusted.

273
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Now, fast forward.

274
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm in Europe,

275
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
fun place,

276
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
in a country that shall not be named.

277
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
And I met a brother.

278
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I was like,

279
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Masha'Allah, I'm...

280
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
I have one son.

281
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
His name is Muhammad.

282
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
I was like, beautiful name.

283
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
I was like, yeah, but I told the government,

284
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
I have four sons,

285
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
and I spelled Muhammad M-U-H-A,

286
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
M-O-H-A, M-O-U-H-A,

287
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
with a double M, with a single M.

288
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
And I get benefits for four sons.

289
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
I collect four checks from the kufar.

290
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Masha'Allah.

291
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
I don't even pay rent.

292
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Alhamdulillah.

293
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
I was like, oh,

294
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,500
I've heard this.

295
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
I've seen this before.

296
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
You can steal from them because they're what?

297
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I go, father, let us steal from them.

298
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
This was something that we,

299
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,500
the Quran criticized this about a group of people before.

300
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
But whose behavior is this?

301
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
This is now,

302
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
not all Muslims,

303
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
but some Muslims, absolutely.

304
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Absolutely their behavior.

305
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
So this mentality,

306
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
this mindset,

307
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,500
is actually what the Quran criticizes.

308
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
However, now,

309
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
among them were those who said,

310
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
these ummiyyn are less.

311
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Then they developed other narratives.

312
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
The Abraham had two children.

313
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
The children of,

314
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
or the lineases,

315
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
the children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael.

316
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Ishaq and Isma'id.

317
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
And they developed an entire literature

318
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
how Isma'id is not even legitimate,

319
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,500
which is according to the Bible, not true.

320
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
He is legitimate in the Bible.

321
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Oh, Isma'id is not really his son.

322
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Or Isma'id is the cursed son.

323
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
So all of his children are going to be what?

324
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,500
They're going to be cursed, right?

325
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
The cursed line of Ishmael.

326
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
I've even heard sermons and churches about that.

327
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
The cursed line of Ishmael.

328
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Then they developed some of the,

329
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,500
developed this concept of the non-Jews being goyim.

330
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Goyim is their word for ummi.

331
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Uneducated, unlettered.

332
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
They don't know what the wahi is.

333
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
But they became so extreme.

334
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Some of them became so extreme.

335
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Even the Jews among them

336
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
that did not belong to their elite class,

337
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
they were also called goyim.

338
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Also called ummiyyn.

339
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
So they get even more exclusive.

340
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Now, of course, Muslims don't do this.

341
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Muslims don't have some group that says

342
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
we're the right ones.

343
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Everybody else is going to Jahannam.

344
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
And then eventually they say

345
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
we're the only few Muslims that are right.

346
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
And all the other Muslims, 72 sects,

347
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
are all going to burn in Jahannam.

348
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Thank God I belong to the special Golden Club.

349
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Mutahar Club, right?

350
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Because everybody else is just nudges.

351
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
I don't know.

352
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
I don't even know if I should pray next to these people.

353
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I don't even know if I can say salam to them or...

354
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
So forget their condescending view

355
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
of the rest of humanity.

356
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
They even developed a condescending view

357
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
of fellow believers.

358
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
And this is not new.

359
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
This happened already in what history?

360
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
In Israelite history.

361
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
And our prophet told us,

362
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
لزت بيعن صدر الذين من قبلكم

363
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
You will end up following the ways

364
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
of the people who came before you.

365
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Allah says in this ayah,

366
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
He sent a messenger.

367
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
And raised them among who?

368
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
The Umayyin,

369
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
the people that the Israelites considered what?

370
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Nudges.

371
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
The people that were unworthy.

372
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
The people from the cursed line of Ismail.

373
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
In the previous ayah,

374
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
He used the word on Qudus,

375
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
the holy, the pure.

376
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
And the Israelites believed because of that name.

377
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Who did He make pure?

378
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Them.

379
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Some of them even developed this fatwa

380
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
that whoever stood under the mountain,

381
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
and their children are forever pure.

382
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
And whoever was not under the mountain,

383
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
their children are forever impure.

384
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Cool.

385
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
So now Allah takes this concept of superiority

386
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
and says,

387
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
By the way,

388
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I'm going to send a messenger.

389
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
And whom am I going to send it among?

390
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
The Umayyin.

391
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Umayyin, by the way,

392
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
really cool word.

393
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Really epic word.

394
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Umayyin has a couple of meanings.

395
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
One, belonging to a certain nation from Ummah.

396
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
So these were nationalistic people.

397
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Or ethnic peoples.

398
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
But Ummah also means,

399
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Ka'annahu Kharaja min Ummi.

400
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
As if he knows nothing like the day

401
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
he came out of his mother.

402
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Ummi means mother, right?

403
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Ummi means so uneducated,

404
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
so unknowledgeable about the work,

405
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
about the revelation, about God,

406
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
about prophets.

407
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
As if he just came out of his mother.

408
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
No background, no history,

409
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,500
no intellectual, scholarly history, nothing.

410
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Allah decided to send a messenger among these people.

411
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Could Allah have sent a messenger among the Roman Empire?

412
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Among the Greeks who have a history of philosophy?

413
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Among the Chinese who have poetry, literature?

414
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Among the Indians who have the Sanskrit philosophies?

415
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
And they were into the Persians?

416
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
There were so many civilizations in the world

417
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
that have long standing intellectual histories

418
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
and empires and civilizations.

419
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
And the one place in the world that was forgotten

420
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
that nobody knows about, nobody cares.

421
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Is what?

422
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
That Arabian desert, man.

423
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
There's a Roman Empire on this side.

424
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
There's the Persian Empire on that side.

425
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
There's the Abyssinian Empire on that side.

426
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
And even they don't care that you're in the middle

427
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
because this is sand.

428
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
They don't want to expand into this territory.

429
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Let them be. Let these shepherds do their thing.

430
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Let these camel herders do their thing.

431
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Who cares about them?

432
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
They are a forgotten chapter of history.

433
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
When you go across the Khalij,

434
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
when you go across the desert of Hijaz,

435
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
did you see ancient palaces?

436
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Did you see the ruins of great civilizations?

437
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Did you see it?

438
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Nothing.

439
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
These people have no education, no background.

440
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,500
And they just go and they go towards Syria,

441
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
and they go towards Yemen,

442
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
and they do their little trade.

443
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Sometimes they end up in Roman territory near Syria.

444
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Sometimes they go towards the Africa

445
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
and make a little bit of money here,

446
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
make a little bit of money there.

447
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
And they're a great city.

448
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
It's a city that happens to have a well.

449
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
That's like, oh my God, you're in Makkah.

450
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Makkah is nice. You got a well.

451
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
It's got burnt rock.

452
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
It's got insanely hot temperate.

453
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
How many people have been to Makkah?

454
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Does it look like a tourist attraction

455
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
if it wasn't for the haram?

456
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Would a human being have any reason

457
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,500
to go to Makkah if it wasn't for the Ka'bah?

458
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Like what?

459
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
When you go there,

460
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
the Horses Allah, you would rather...

461
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
People walk, people get up late for the Horses Allah,

462
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
so they end up praying inside the mall.

463
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
So they don't have to pray.

464
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Because the beating Sun, man, the beating...

465
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
And among them, a less-than-to-messenger?

466
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Among them?

467
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,500
First, he describes the ultimate king of all kings,

468
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
and then he takes the most forgotten,

469
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,500
the most, like, kind of unimportant part of the world map.

470
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
You know?

471
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
The insignificant part of the world map

472
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
and says, yep, right here.

473
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Why? Because thousands of years before,

474
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
there was a man named Ibrahim A.S.

475
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
who built his house in this unknown desert

476
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
and made a dua thousands of years ago.

477
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Ya Allah, send a messenger among these people

478
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
and bring people's hearts towards this hot desert

479
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
where nobody's heart would want to go.

480
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
People would rather go to Hawaii,

481
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
they would rather go to California,

482
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
they would rather go to Switzerland,

483
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
they would rather go to New Zealand,

484
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
they would rather go anywhere else, not here.

485
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
But ya Allah, bring people's hearts here

486
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
and give them, give, send them a messenger here.

487
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Thousands of years ago, there was no recorder at the time,

488
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
there was no microphone, there was no camera that recorded this,

489
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
there was no writer who wrote this down,

490
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
it was just him and God talking.

491
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Ya Allah, send a messenger among these people

492
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
that are going to settle here.

493
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
That's this dua.

494
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
And thousands of years after that,

495
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
what does Allah do?

496
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
He decides to send among these people

497
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
who have been pagan for centuries.

498
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
By the way, the house that Abraham built

499
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
is surrounded by what?

500
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Idols for centuries.

501
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
These are pagan people.

502
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Even if we lived at the time,

503
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
we were like, oh, Mushrikun,

504
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
enna ma al Mushrikun al Najas,

505
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
the Mushrikun al Najas, they're filthy.

506
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
The Zut-e-Quran describes them,

507
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
people of Shirkah are dirty,

508
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
because spiritual dirt is on them.

509
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
So the Israelites consider them unworthy, dirty.

510
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Look, they're pagans, they're idol worshipers.

511
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Look at what they believe, these false religions.

512
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
And among them, Allah decides to send a messenger.

513
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Suhan Allah.

514
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
What a decision Allah made,

515
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
the king of all kings.

516
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
And the way he's going to describe that decision,

517
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
that he let them, it's not even,

518
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
and I know it's time,

519
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
he could have been an Arab from among them,

520
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
but he was raised among the Romans.

521
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
So he knows higher society, you know?

522
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Or he was raised among the Greek,

523
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
or he was raised among the Persian,

524
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
so he gets to know what royalty is like.

525
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
You know, like Musa'a al-Asa'alam was among the Israelites,

526
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
but he was raised where?

527
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
He was raised in the palace.

528
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
So Allah could have raised the prophets

529
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
like Suhan Allah in a palace somewhere,

530
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,500
and then he can come and bring higher education to his people.

531
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
No, he was raised within them.

532
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
He's from them and he's within them.

533
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
The highest education the human being,

534
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
humanity ever received as the word of Allah,

535
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
and it came in a place that was the least educated,

536
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
arguably on earth.

537
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
That's where it began, from absolute zero.

538
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
From absolute zero.

539
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
And there, today you and I are sitting here.

540
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
SubhanAllah.

541
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.

542
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Just before you continue, I want to let you know

543
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500

or even sponsor students for bayinatv.com

546
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
so we can create worldwide communities of students

547
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
that are studying the meanings and the benefit

548
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
and the wisdom of the Quran,

549
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
and are insha'Allah ta'ala spreading that in their own circles.

550
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Thanks so much.

551
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
In ayah number two of Surat al-Jum'ah,

552
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Allah will not just introduce us

553
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
where and how He raised this messenger,

554
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
which we talked about in the last session.

555
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Allah will introduce us to four things

556
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
that the messenger is going to do.

557
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
His mission is being summarized

558
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
as four tasks.

559
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Okay?

560
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
And this is almost as if

561
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,500
there's what he's supposed to do,

562
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,500
what his goal is, is actually mentioned in Surah Tussaf.

563
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
In the previous Surah, Allah mentioned

564
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
what is the goal of sending the messenger.

565
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
But every time you have a goal,

566
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
you have to have a method so you can reach that goal.

567
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
You have to have a formula, a practice to reach that goal.

568
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
To make it super simple, if somebody says,

569
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,500
I want you to become good enough so you can join the team,

570
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
then they have to have a training program,

571
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
some kind of formula they have to follow,

572
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
then they can get there.

573
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
What is the regiment that he's going to follow?

574
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
This ayah is about the method,

575
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
the process of the Prophet,

576
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

577
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
And before we get into that process,

578
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,500
I just want you to know that this process is forever true.

579
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Like this isn't just, it was started by the Prophet,

580
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
alayhi sallallahu alayhi wa sallam,

581
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
and then it was passed down until judgment day

582
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
for the ummah to learn that this is the process to do what?

583
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
This is the process to bring about change.

584
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Now there are two kinds of change.

585
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
There's change inside a person,

586
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
and there's change inside society.

587
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,500
You see around you someone who was not praying,

588
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
they were drinking alcohol,

589
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
they were basically kind of practically not a Muslim,

590
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
and then something changed,

591
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
and they became a completely different person.

592
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
The way the people they hang out with,

593
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
the way they spend their time, their prayers,

594
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
their drinking and eating habits,

595
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
everything changed.

596
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
There was a revolution inside them,

597
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
and they became a completely different individual.

598
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
That's personal change.

599
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
And then because of that one person,

600
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
maybe their friends, some of them started changing.

601
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Maybe their community started changing a little bit.

602
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
And those kinds of changes happen every day.

603
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
There are people that experience these amazing transformations.

604
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
So many of you have come up to me and told me,

605
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
hey, I wasn't even praying five months ago,

606
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
or I wasn't even wearing hijab a year ago,

607
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
or four months ago, or five months ago, etc.

608
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
There are changes happening even in this room.

609
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
And some of you are,

610
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
and it's not like the change is complete,

611
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
you're still changing, you're still on the road to change.

612
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,500
The problem happens is when we see the world,

613
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
and we see that it's getting worse, right?

614
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
And disobedience to Allah is increasing,

615
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
and chaos is increasing,

616
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
and shamelessness is increasing,

617
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
and disbelief is increasing,

618
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
and confusion is increasing,

619
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
we get depressed,

620
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,500
because we see the big picture looks worse and worse and worse.

621
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
And when you look at the big picture,

622
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
it does look pretty depressing.

623
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
And what that does is it makes you blind

624
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,500
to the individual changes.

625
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Because it feels like the individual changes are not enough,

626
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,500
because real change is when it happens on a very large scale.

627
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
If you think about the life of the Prophet,

628
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

629
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,500
if Allah wanted big change to happen from the beginning,

630
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Allah would have sent the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam

631
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,500
to the economic or the political capitals or centers of the world.

632
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
But Allah sent the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam

633
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
to a place that was not an economic player,

634
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
not a cap, not a political player,

635
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
not a social player, not a cultural player,

636
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
not an educational center,

637
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,500
it was not a contributor to the world.

638
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
You could say about the Chinese,

639
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
they were contributing silk,

640
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,500
or they were contributing other fine goods or arts to the world.

641
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
You could say things about the Romans, the Persians,

642
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,500
the other civilizations were players on the world scene,

643
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,500
and trade and craft and civilization and empire building, all of it.

644
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
What were the ancient Arabs doing in the desert?

645
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
They had some empires back in the day,

646
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
some large stretches of empire,

647
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
but that was gone for centuries and centuries.

648
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
They were not players on the world stage.

649
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
And even the changes that the Prophet brought,

650
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

651
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,500
and the Quran that kept teaching this message,

652
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,500
what are some of the Quran's greatest heroes?

653
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
There are people like Nuh Alaihi Wasallam.

654
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
And if you study the life of Nuh Alaihi Wasallam,

655
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
and you say, I want to see the big change that was brought by Nuh Alaihi Wasallam.

656
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
What's his progress report after 10 years?

657
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
And what's the, you know, because you're in your company,

658
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
you have to have a progress report, right?

659
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
How much more did your sphere of influence grow

660
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,500
after 50 years, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500?

661
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
950 years. Where's the progress?

662
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
You didn't even make progress with your own son?

663
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
What is this?

664
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,500
You don't call this, but they are heroes in the Quran.

665
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
And Ibrahim Alaihi Wasallam, this is called the religion of Ibrahim Alaihi Wasallam,

666
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
couldn't even convince his own dad, could he?

667
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
And Yaqub Alaihi Wasallam couldn't convince his own sons for a long time.

668
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
You couldn't do that.

669
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was sent to the Quraysh

670
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
and the vast majority of them for the first 13 years, did they believe or not?

671
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
No, the vast majority of them didn't believe.

672
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
But the few people that did believe,

673
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,500
the few people that did believe are actually the reason we're Muslim today.

674
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Those few people, what is the Quran teaching us about change?

675
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Change does not come at the hands of the millions.

676
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Change comes at the hands of the few.

677
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,500
It is actually individual transformation that is vital.

678
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,500
That is the most important objective.

679
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Actually the victory from Allah and the millions of people accepting Islam and all that stuff,

680
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
that's in the hands of Allah.

681
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
That's in the hands of Allah.

682
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,500
But individuals have to experience and the bishans of the prophets

683
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,500
is actually to bring about an individual transformation.

684
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,500
These ayat are about the process of an individual transformation.

685
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,500
How does a person transform?

686
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,500
When we learn that properly, then you can see how a family might transform.

687
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,500
When you learn that enough, then you can see how a community might transform.

688
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,500
It starts like a pebble when you throw it in the water.

689
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,500
It's one pebble, but it has ripples and ripples and ripples and ripples.

690
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,500
But the first thing is actually the individual transformation, isn't it?

691
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
That's what this ayat is actually about.

692
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,500
How did this transformation actually take place in the hearts of these individuals?

693
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
It's going to be based on four steps.

694
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,500
These are the four steps of the Prophet ﷺ bringing about this transformation that Allah gave him.

695
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:33,500
So if you think about the, especially the last name of Allah, al-Hakim, his wisdom,

696
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,500
he decided that this should be the strategy to bring about consistent change.

697
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
So it begins with yatlu'a alayhim ayatihi.

698
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,500
He reads onto them his ayat.

699
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,500
And this is probably where we're going to take our discussion today this far.

700
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,500
And then we'll do the other three steps tomorrow in shall I complete this.

701
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Read, so tada yatlu'a alayhim.

702
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,500
We say he narrates the ayat or he reads the ayat onto them.

703
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Atilu is used for young animals which follow their mother.

704
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Walad ul-Himar, walad ul-Naqqa, they're called tilwining.

705
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Wherever the mom goes, the baby follows.

706
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,500
You know, some babies are difficult, like Afghan babies, right?

707
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,500
They run away from their parents, but some babies are very clingy.

708
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Wherever the mom goes, mama, mama, mama, mama.

709
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Like they just kind of, you don't even have to put a tracker on them or nothing.

710
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
It was just automatic magnetic field, right?

711
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,500
And some kids, you have to literally tie them up with a, now they come with baby leashes.

712
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
I've seen those things now, right?

713
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
So that the kid doesn't, you know, disappear.

714
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,500
But when certain animals, they know that if they stray away from the mother, they're going to get killed.

715
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
So they just stick very close to the mother.

716
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
They follow her step by step.

717
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
And those kinds of animals are called tilwan.

718
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,500
At-tulawa is the remainder of a thing, meaning what follows behind a thing.

719
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Taqiyatu shay'a'amatan.

720
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Tattalla is to follow something closely or repeatedly.

721
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Tattab'uhu.

722
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Allah even says,

723
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,500
wa shamsi idha ad-dhuhaha wa al-qamari idha.

724
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Tadah, tadah in Arabic, when the moon follows the sun.

725
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,500
The moon follows the sun, so the word following is tadah.

726
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
So what does this word have to do with reading?

727
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,500
When someone's reading something, their eyes are following to the next word.

728
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,500
You're pronouncing this word, but your eyes are already on the next word.

729
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,500
You're following and following and following, and your fingers and your eyes are following the text.

730
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,500
And that's actually called tida'wa, to follow.

731
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,500
And Allah used this word really interestingly because it's actually a contradiction.

732
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Ummiyin means people that were as uneducated and unlettered as when they came out of their mothers.

733
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,500
And he's actually a prophet that's among the ummiyin.

734
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
So how is he reciting something?

735
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
How is he reading something?

736
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Allah has given this messenger the ability to read the word of Allah in a rabbi sense.

737
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Meaning that this is not reading from literally a scripture.

738
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,500
It's reading from the angel is teaching him how to read.

739
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
An angel is making him read.

740
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,500
And he's actually, instead of following a piece of paper or a piece of leather, following it,

741
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,500
he's actually following the instructions of who?

742
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Jibril, alayhi salam.

743
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,500
So he's actually still following, which is a really powerful expression.

744
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Yatlu alayhim.

745
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
But what is he reciting?

746
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Now, if those of you that are a little bit familiar with Arabic, it's actually

747
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Yatlu alayhim.

748
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
The maf'ool bihi comes first.

749
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
The jarr majroor, mta'adat bel-firil comes second.

750
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
But this is muqaddam.

751
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Now I'll speak in human.

752
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:40,500
What that means is Allah is saying, He, especially on these people, these ummiyin, he recites.

753
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Meaning the Quran came especially first targeting these audience from their,

754
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,500
so the Quran will use expressions that are used in Arabic by these people in their culture.

755
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
It'll use sayings that they're used to.

756
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,500
It'll use examples that they're used to.

757
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
It'll use language that they're used to.

758
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
It's not going to use some high level language.

759
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,500
It's going to use the people's language because he's going to recite especially for them.

760
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Allah, the owner of all wisdom.

761
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Allah has all knowledge.

762
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,500
There's no knowledge of physics or chemistry or biology or history or anthropology,

763
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
any science in the world or beyond the world.

764
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,500
There's no knowledge that Allah doesn't have.

765
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,500
And you know, the more someone knows, the more complicated their speech becomes.

766
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Have you ever tried talking to a PhD?

767
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,500
It's not a normal conversation because their vocabulary causes aesthetics, right?

768
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:37,500
When they speak, it's just really hard because they don't know how to come down to the rest of us peasants.

769
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
They stay up here, right?

770
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Allah, knower of all things, you would expect, will speak in the most complicated ways

771
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
because he's the knower of all things.

772
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
But what did he do?

773
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,500
He decided to speak to the least educated people in the world

774
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,500
and then he decided to speak to them in a way that they can understand.

775
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,500
And so he sent a messenger whose accent, whose cultural expressions,

776
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
whose upbringing they're familiar with.

777
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,500
So first he chose the teacher that will be the most familiar to them

778
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,500
and then he chose his words that would be the easiest for them to understand.

779
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Why is this important?

780
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Because as you will see in the next ayah tomorrow, inshallah,

781
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Allah's plan was nobody should say, my words are too complicated.

782
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I don't get it.

783
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Nobody should have that excuse because this wasn't sent to scholars, it was sent to who?

784
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Umayyin.

785
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
The Umayyin, you see?

786
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
So it was meant for everybody.

787
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,500
If Umayyin can handle it, anybody can handle it.

788
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,500
If they can understand it, what excuse you got left?

789
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
You see?

790
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
And what did the Israelites do with their book?

791
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
No, no, no, no, no.

792
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
They told the average follower among the Israelites,

793
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
you can't read the book.

794
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
No, no, no, it's not for you.

795
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
You're going to get misguided.

796
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Let us read it.

797
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
We'll tell you what it says.

798
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Because if you read it, then you're just going to go to hell.

799
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
It's not for you.

800
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Alhamdulillah, Muslims didn't do that.

801
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Tell the average Muslim, no, no, no, don't read the Quran.

802
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
It's not for you.

803
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
This is for the scholars.

804
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,500
They read it and they'll tell you what it says.

805
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Don't try to read it on your own.

806
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,500
It's better for you to just listen to some recitation, put it on YouTube and cook your food.

807
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Okay?

808
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
That's for you.

809
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Understanding the book, that's just for the scholars.

810
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,500
This was something the Israelites did and Alhamdulillah, the Muslims don't even ever think about that.

811
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Okay.

812
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Anyway, now I'll tell you something amazing.

813
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
What did I tell you about the Israelites?

814
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Some Israelites, they started believing they are special and everybody else is Goyim.

815
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Everybody else is Ummi.

816
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Okay?

817
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
I'm going to tell you something.

818
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Every time I read these ayat, I feel like it's the first time I'm reading them.

819
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
This is a long set of ayat.

820
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,500
I'm just going to read them and translate them for you and just appreciate what Allah says.

821
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
This is from Surah Al-Araf.

822
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Wa khtarah Musa qalmahu s-sir'ina rajul an-dimiqatina.

823
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Allah, Musa al-Aliy salam chose his people, chose 70 people from his people, 70 leaders, to meet with us.

824
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
So now Musa al-Aliy salam, you remember the story when they worshiped the calf?

825
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Right?

826
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Musa al-Aliy salam left and then behind him just ended up worshiping the golden calf, right?

827
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Now when they did that, Allah wanted to hold them responsible.

828
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,500
So Allah said, bring your leaders to me, I will speak to them directly.

829
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,500
So now he used to speak to who directly before?

830
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Musa.

831
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,500
But Allah says, no, I want to speak to your tribe leaders, the elders.

832
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,500
So Musa al-Aliy salam chose how many leaders?

833
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
70, to meet with Allah.

834
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Limiqatina for our meeting.

835
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,500
So they came to the mountain to meet with Allah.

836
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Then the mountain started shaking.

837
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,500
So when they took the calf, when the earthquake started rumbling and they're all shaking,

838
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Musa is there, 70 leaders are there, they think they're about to die,

839
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
boulders are falling from the mountain.

840
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Musa al-Aliy salam spoke, Allah said, if you had wanted, you would have killed them already.

841
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Before we ever came here, you would have killed everybody, you would have killed me too.

842
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Why are you shaking it like this?

843
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Are you killing us because of what the fools did among us?

844
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
Is that what you're doing, Ya Rabb?

845
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
He's in shock and he's asking Allah,

846
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Inhiya illa fitna, he goes, no, no, no, this is nothing but a trial.

847
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,500
This is nothing but a test that you're doing with us.

848
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Tudil lubiha mantasha'u wa tahdi mantasha'u

849
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:39,500
You will allow whoever you want to be misguided because of this test.

850
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,500
And you will allow whoever to be guided because of this test.

851
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,500
So one of the lessons here, side lesson is when Allah shakes your life up,

852
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,500
it will either misguide you or guide you.

853
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Some people get their life shakes up and they say, you know what, I used to be a Muslim,

854
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,500
but Allah shook my life up, that's it, I don't pray anymore.

855
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,500
What's the point? Allah shook my life up, you see.

856
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,500
And other people, Allah shakes their life up and they weren't praying before

857
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
and all of a sudden they're in Sajda.

858
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Tudil lubiha mantasha'u wa tahdi mantasha'u

859
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
With what? With the shaking.

860
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Anta wali yuna, you are our protecting friend.

861
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Faqfil lana warhamna.

862
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Forgive us, show us your love and care.

863
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Wa anta qayru l-ghafireen, and you are the best of those who forgives.

864
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Who's speaking right now?

865
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Musa is speaking, the mountain is shaking, the 70 leaders are with him,

866
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
he's speaking to Allah and he keeps speaking.

867
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Wa qtub lana fi hadhi hid dunya hasana.

868
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,500
Please guarantee for us, right for us, in this life, beautiful things,

869
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
wa fil ahira, and in the next life,

870
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,500
inna al-hudna ilayk, I'll come back to this tomorrow.

871
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
We turn back to you.

872
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,500
Hadha yahudu means to turn back. We turn back to you.

873
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Meaning we're making Toba to you.

874
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,500
We came here asking for forgiveness, me and these 70 leaders.

875
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Now Allah will respond.

876
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
I want you to remember where this is happening.

877
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,500
This is Musa and 70 leaders of the Israelites

878
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
and they have come under the mountain.

879
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
And later on, some groups of them believed

880
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,500
whoever was under the mountain with Musa is forever what?

881
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Forever pure everybody else is?

882
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Impure, that's the belief they developed.

883
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Now this is the Quran's version of the same story.

884
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
The Quran retelling the story. Listen, now Allah will respond.

885
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Allah says, qala aadha bi usibubihi man asha.

886
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
My punishment?

887
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,500
I will strike it to whoever I want.

888
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,500
I'll strike my punishment to whoever I want.

889
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Did you say you're protected from my punishment?

890
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
No, you said no. I will strike my punishment down to

891
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:45,500
but my loving care extends to everything.

892
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:52,500
So my punishment is targeted but my rahma is everywhere.

893
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,500
My rahma doesn't have to be targeted because it's already everywhere

894
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,500
but my punishment is targeted. See the difference in language?

895
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,500
So I will write this to those who are watching this.

896
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,500
And those who believe in our ayat.

897
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Those who are going to follow the messenger,

898
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:41,500
who's the prophet, who is unlettered,

899
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:47,500
the one they find written with them,

900
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
in the Torah and in the Injil.

901
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Meaning Allah is telling them on the mountain,

902
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,500
right now you have Torah and later on there will be a prophet

903
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
who will give you another book called what?

904
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Injil and in both of these books you will find that there is a prophet coming.

905
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,500
He's a prophet, he's a messenger, he's unlettered

906
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
and he's mentioned in both of these scriptures

907
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,500
and I will guarantee my mercy for you if you follow him.

908
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Under the mountain.

909
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Under the...

910
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,500
When ha'hum anil munkili, that messenger will come,

911
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
he will tell them to do the right thing

912
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
and he will stop them from doing the wrong thing

913
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,500
and he will make good and pure things for them

914
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,500
and he will make filthy things impermissible for them

915
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,500
and he will remove from them their burdens

916
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,500
and their chains that used to be on them.

917
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Meaning Allah is already telling them

918
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
you will have a life of burdens and chains

919
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,500
and those burdens and chains will be removed by who?

920
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
By the prophet who will come.

921
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,500
He will come and he will remove those burdens and chains

922
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
فَالَّذِينَ آْمَنُوا بِهِ

923
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Then those who believe in him, in who?

924
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Who's the him here?

925
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
The Sulla S.

926
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
وَعَزَّرُواهُ

927
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
And they support him

928
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
وَنَّصَرُواهُ

929
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
And they aid him

930
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
And they honor him and they aid him

931
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
وَتَّبَعُ النُورَ اللَّذِيْ اُنْزِلَ معهُ

932
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
And they follow the light that was sent,

933
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,500
that will be sent down with him.

934
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
What's the light that is sent down with him?

935
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
The Quran.

936
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,500
وَلَا إِكَهُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ

937
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Those are the people that are successful.

938
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,500
This is a conversation about the Annabi Al-Ummi

939
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,500
that was had first with Musa and his 70 followers.

940
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
One of the earliest teachings

941
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,500
to the followers of Musa, the Bani Israel,

942
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,500
and then it was reinforced in which book?

943
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
It wasn't just in Torah, it's where else?

944
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Indeed, it was given to who?

945
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
That's why Isa says in the Quran

946
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,500
وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَاْتِيمٍ بَعْدِسْمُهُ أَحْمَدْ

947
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
I have come to give you good news of a messenger

948
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
who's coming after me, whose name is Ahmed,

949
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
which is in the previous Surah.

950
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Okay, this is in Surah al-Saf.

951
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,500
So Musa is telling of the coming of Muhammad,

952
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,500
and Isa, Al-Islam, is telling of the coming of Muhammad,

953
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,500
so according to that, both the Christian, the Jewish peoples,

954
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
and their scripture, the ones who know among them

955
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,500
will know that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah,

956
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
salallahu alayhi wa sallam.

957
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,500
So when he says he sent among the Ummi-een a messenger,

958
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,500
people who were loyal to the scripture would say,

959
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
among the Ummi-een?

960
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Hey, wait, among the Ummi-een?

961
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Every generation of the Israelites from Musa, al-Ali-salaam,

962
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,500
later on in their prophets, like all the Israelites,

963
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Suleiman, Dawood, every one of them follow Torah,

964
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,500
and that means every one of them knows who's coming.

965
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Muhammad, al-Salaam, is coming, they're waiting, they're waiting,

966
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
they're waiting, they're waiting, all these generations, they're waiting.

967
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
And Allah even says in Surah al-Baqarah,

968
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
that the Israelites who lived in the region,

969
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,500
sometimes they would get into a fight with the Mushrikun of Makkah.

970
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
And the Mushrikun of Makkah were better fighters, so they would win.

971
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
And when they would win, you know what they would say?

972
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Wa ka'alum bin qablu yas tafti'un a'alalladheena kafaru.

973
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Whenever they would get beat up, they would say,

974
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
oh yeah, you won this time.

975
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
But we've been studying.

976
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,500
The last prophet is coming any day now, and once he comes,

977
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,500
we're gonna get you so good.

978
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
They used to say this whenever they lost a fight.

979
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
It's in the Qur'an, Surah al-Baqarah.

980
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
And then when analysis,

981
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
falamma ja'a, hum ma'arafu,

982
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
and when whatever they already knew came,

983
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
they denied it.

984
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
They denied it.

985
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
So they actually used to use,

986
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
is tiftaah of the coming of the prophet,

987
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
salallahu alayhi wa salam, to the Qur'an.

988
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
They used to say to them, by the way,

989
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
all the signs are here.

990
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Oh, he's coming.

991
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Our wa la maa, give qabba now it is, anytime now.

992
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
He's so coming right now.

993
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
And then he came.

994
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Now this is yatlu alayhim.

995
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Now, yatlu, what do we learn from yatlu?

996
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
This is really important.

997
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
The Bible will tell us of the prophet,

998
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
salallahu alayhim, whatever is left of it,

999
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
that Allah says about him,

1000
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
and what's left of the Bible,

1001
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
I will put my words in his mouth.

1002
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
See the taura,

1003
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,500
the taura is a collection of divine teachings,

1004
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
but it's not precisely the word of God,

1005
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
not even according to the rabbis.

1006
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
It's a collection of memories and teachings.

1007
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
The closest thing that we have to that

1008
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
is something like samah hadith,

1009
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
or some opinions. In fact,

1010
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
it's a combination of what they consider the word of Allah,

1011
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,500
and hadith, and tafsir, and fiqh,

1012
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
and history, all in one.

1013
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,500
You know how in the tafsir of the Quran,

1014
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
you have the ayah and then you have the commentary?

1015
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
And taura, where does the ayah end

1016
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,500
and where does the commentary begin?

1017
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
They don't make a distinction.

1018
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
So they can't tell.

1019
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
They can't tell. That's what happened over time.

1020
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Maybe after I gotta finish my train of thought,

1021
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
I'll take your question.

1022
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
But then Allah gave, and this is why Allah says,

1023
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
or

1024
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
The Quran confirms what they have in front of them,

1025
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
because what they have in front of them is a huge tradition.

1026
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,500
The mishnah, the taura, is a massive tradition.

1027
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
And then the talmud, it's all mixed together.

1028
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
And this is not because they made changes to the word of Allah.

1029
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
That's a separate problem.

1030
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Allah did not give them a word

1031
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
that was memorized the way that the Quran is memorized.

1032
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
But they knew a prophet is coming,

1033
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
who about him said,

1034
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
I will put my words in his mouth.

1035
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Meaning, it won't even be his own words.

1036
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
He'll be following the words that are given to him.

1037
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Yatlu alayhim a'ayati.

1038
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Okay, so now,

1039
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
if I'm speaking to you right now,

1040
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,500
imagine, so, I mean, I can give you a German example,

1041
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,500
because I don't know any German, except for ya.

1042
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
And shnel.

1043
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
But,

1044
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
it works in many situations.

1045
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
It's like in traffic.

1046
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
Like, you know, that's it.

1047
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Anyway,

1048
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
so,

1049
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,500
most of the time, okay, so if your child,

1050
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,500
sitting at dinner,

1051
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,500
your child memorized some poetry in German

1052
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
and sat there and started reciting that poetry,

1053
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,500
would you believe that that's your own child's words,

1054
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
even though there's no paper in front of them?

1055
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
Can you tell that's not your child's words?

1056
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Because you know how your child speaks.

1057
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
In fact, even if your parents started doing that,

1058
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,500
you'd be like,

1059
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,500
where did you get this?

1060
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Why did you do this?

1061
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
And if you really think that's them speaking,

1062
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
then you contact the Imam

1063
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,500
because there's a Jinn possession or something.

1064
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Because when someone speaks out of their normal,

1065
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,500
you can tell they're not really speaking, they're reading.

1066
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,500
The Prophet's voice to them has lived among the people

1067
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
the Prophet's voice to them has lived among them

1068
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
so they know how he speaks.

1069
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,500
But now, he's not speaking, he is what?

1070
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Reciting, following words that are given to him.

1071
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,500
Can they tell this is a clear distinction between his speech

1072
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
and the words that are coming out of his mouth are clearly not his?

1073
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,500
This is why they said,

1074
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,500
why is he talking like this?

1075
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
What is this?

1076
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Is this,

1077
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
this is being dictated to him?

1078
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Where'd you get these words from?

1079
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,500
Is this poetry?

1080
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,500
What is that?

1081
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Is that mad?

1082
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Man, it has such an effect on me.

1083
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
Is this some kind of magic or something?

1084
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Whoever,

1085
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
whoever listens to this feels like they got possessed.

1086
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
So maybe he's possessed too.

1087
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
They came up with all these theories

1088
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,500
because they knew this is clearly not his own speech.

1089
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
There's an author by the name of Basim Sayyih,

1090
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,500
whose also, his book has also been translated to English,

1091
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,500
who did a thorough study of thousands and thousands of hadith

1092
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,500
of the Prophet's voice to them,

1093
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,500
and the speech pattern in hadith,

1094
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
because everybody has a speech pattern.

1095
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,500
If you listen to my speeches and you transcribe them,

1096
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,500
there's going to be a lot of right, right?

1097
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,500
Right, so there's a lot of right in my,

1098
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,500
not enough left, a lot of right.

1099
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,500
But that's just my speech pattern.

1100
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,500
And the Prophet himself also has a what?

1101
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
A speech pattern.

1102
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,500
And they did an analysis of the speech pattern of all the hadith

1103
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
and the speech pattern of the Quran,

1104
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
and it's clearly two distinct speakers.

1105
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
They're not the same speaker.

1106
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,500
Just from a speech pattern point of view, right?

1107
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
So, yatlu a'lai him a'ayati, the wording is not his,

1108
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
it is extremely precise.

1109
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Also means there's no compromise in the meaning.

1110
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
You know, if I'm talking to you,

1111
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
I look first at how old you are,

1112
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
or what your question is,

1113
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
and how many people are listening,

1114
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,500
is this being recorded or not?

1115
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Should I completely go off,

1116
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
or should I just kind of keep my answer contained?

1117
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,500
I have to read the situation before I open my mouth.

1118
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,500
We're aware of who we're talking to.

1119
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,500
But the Prophet, peace be upon him,

1120
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,500
is talking to enemies that hate him,

1121
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,500
and he's not, he cannot consider how to speak to them

1122
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,500
because the words are not his, the words are coming from Allah,

1123
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
and they may be even more offensive

1124
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
to the person standing in front of them,

1125
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
but it doesn't matter, he's going to say them

1126
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
because they are being dictated to him.

1127
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,500
Yatlu a'lai him a'ayati.

1128
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,500
The Messenger, peace be upon him, is actually humble.

1129
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
He's fi'l ummiyine.

1130
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
He comes from a humble beginning.

1131
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
And he's a slave of Allah,

1132
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
and the words are the words of a king.

1133
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
So there's an immediate contrast.

1134
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,500
The speaker is at the lowest level of humility,

1135
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,500
but the words are in the highest level of pride

1136
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
because they are the words of Allah,

1137
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
the owner of all pride.

1138
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,500
He's al-Mutakabbir.

1139
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,500
Al-Mutakabbir is a terrible quality for a person.

1140
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,500
But al-Mutakabbir is one of the attributes of Allah

1141
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
because he deserves it, he is the great one.

1142
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
He speaks from the perspective of being great.

1143
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
So the humility of the Messenger

1144
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
is combined with the greatness of the word of Allah,

1145
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
which is an amazing thing because

1146
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,500
we have to present the word of Allah with its greatness,

1147
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,500
but we still have to carry ourselves with humility.

1148
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,500
The problem happens when we speak about the word of Allah with greatness

1149
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,500
and we start thinking because of that we're kind of great also.

1150
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
We're not, we're still slaves of Allah.

1151
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,500
Then it is meant to be heard like a royal decree, actually.

1152
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,500
It's being recited word for word from the king,

1153
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,500
so you get this appreciation that it's coming from a higher source.

1154
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
And then of course it's an open pronouncement.

1155
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,500
This is the most encouraging thing actually in these ayat.

1156
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,500
And that is that this is an open announcement to even the least learned.

1157
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,500
In other words, it's al-Umiyin.

1158
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:28,500
And Allah decided to give his revelations to the Ummiyin first

1159
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,500
to open up this invitation so no one gets to say,

1160
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
this is not for me.

1161
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Because it's for them, but then everybody's above that.

1162
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
So it's for everyone.

1163
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
The Qur'an was meant to be accessible by everyone.

1164
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
You know, one of the common words for the Qur'an is

1165
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Inzal, Anzal al-Quran.

1166
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Right?

1167
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
So, Inna Anzalnaahu Fi-Layda Til Qadr.

1168
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,500
Nuzul in Arabic doesn't just mean to come down.

1169
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,500
Inzal also means to make something accessible.

1170
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,500
And for centuries the Bible wasn't accessible.

1171
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
For most of the Israelites, the Torah wasn't accessible.

1172
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
Religious teachings weren't accessible.

1173
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,500
The teachings of Ibrahim, al-Azim, were lost to history

1174
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,500
and they were not accessible.

1175
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,500
The truth about the people of the cave was no longer accessible.

1176
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
The stories had been changed.

1177
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
Human beings didn't have access to it.

1178
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,500
And Allah made the Qur'an by definition accessible.

1179
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Everybody can access it.

1180
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
Everybody can engage with an open invitation.

1181
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,500
It's one of the most revolutionary features of the Qur'an.

1182
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
And before I leave you, I'm going to tell you my favorite part

1183
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
because we need to finish this part of the discussion.

1184
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
And then I'll open it up for Qay'a, inshallah.

1185
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
And that is, what does ayameen?

1186
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Yatlu alayhim, ayatihi.

1187
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,500
They translate, he reads on to them his verses or his revelations,

1188
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,500
which is okay.

1189
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,500
But let's dig into the word ayah a little bit.

1190
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
I really want you to appreciate what the word ayah is

1191
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,500
because it's one of the most important terms in the Qur'an.

1192
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
And I'll explain what I've written here.

1193
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Ayah means the specificness of something.

1194
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
So from its origin, ayatur-rajul,

1195
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
I'm talking exactly about that person.

1196
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,500
So something that's very exact can also mean ayah.

1197
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,500
So Allah is not speaking in ambiguous terms.

1198
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,500
Allah is speaking in very exact, precise terms.

1199
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Ta'ayyah, or ta'ayyahu, to direct a course.

1200
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Meaning ta'ayyah, actually it's coming later,

1201
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,500
means Qasada, something that has a purpose.

1202
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Like if I head towards that door,

1203
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500
my body turns towards that door, I keep taking steps.

1204
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,500
Ta'ayyah, ta'ayyah al-bab.

1205
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,500
He headed towards the door he intended to get to the door.

1206
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,500
The ayat aren't just interesting in bits of information.

1207
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,500
They are leading you in a direction.

1208
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,500
They have a purpose.

1209
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,500
So it's driven by a purpose.

1210
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,500
Then the word ayah comes from

1211
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
kharajal qawmu bi-ayatihim.

1212
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
When the Arabs used to travel in the desert,

1213
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,500
and they would start a little fire and cook some food.

1214
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
And then when they're done, they pick up their plates

1215
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,500
and their forks and whatever they eat with the meat.

1216
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
They leave the bones, they leave the burnt wood,

1217
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,500
they leave the ashes, and they pick up all the valuable things,

1218
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500
and they leave.

1219
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,500
But when somebody else comes, they just see the burnt wood

1220
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,500
and the ashes, but they don't see anything valuable.

1221
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
So they say kharajal qawmu bi-ayatihim,

1222
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,500
the people before, they left with all the valuable things.

1223
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
They left nothing of value behind.

1224
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,500
What is an ayah?

1225
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Something of value.

1226
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,500
Something Allah, He's reciting valuable things to them.

1227
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,500
And by the way, Allah says there's an ayah in the mountain,

1228
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,500
there's an ayah inside you, there's an ayah inside the sky,

1229
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
there's an ayah in the bird.

1230
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
What does that tell you about everything?

1231
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,500
Everything according to this deen has what?

1232
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,500
Everything has value.

1233
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,500
Nothing is purposeless.

1234
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
Everything has meaning.

1235
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
It's not a meaningless existence.

1236
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,500
You know?

1237
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,500
Al-istifham, the word ayyi actually means what?

1238
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,500
What kind?

1239
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,500
Curiosity.

1240
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,500
The word ayah actually embeds the meaning of something that inspires curiosity.

1241
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,500
That you should hear the ayah and say,

1242
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,500
I wonder what I can learn from that?

1243
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
I wonder what it means?

1244
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
And ayyi is actually for atta'ajj,

1245
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
which is already covered in qasad.

1246
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
So atta'ajj means amazement.

1247
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,500
The Arabic used to say ayyi rajul or ayyi waladz or ayyi mar'a,

1248
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,500
which means what a man, what a child, what a woman, ayyi kitab,

1249
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
what an amazing book.

1250
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,500
So ayyi was used as an expression of amazement.

1251
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,500
And the ayat are supposed to bring about an amazement.

1252
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,500
Like what an amazing thing Allah has said.

1253
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,500
An nida wa'tanbihi li'l qareeb duna al-ba'eed.

1254
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Ayah ayyi is also used for, it's actually similar to English.

1255
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,500
Ay man, ay, ayyu.

1256
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,500
When you say ay, what are you actually doing?

1257
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,500
You're calling someone close.

1258
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,500
And ayyi was actually used, ayyi rajul was also used for ya'arajul,

1259
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
meaning come here for closeness.

1260
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,500
Meaning the ayat are also calling you.

1261
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,500
They're also Allah calling you close to yourself.

1262
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Then it's an alama.

1263
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,500
Alama means it's a sign for something.

1264
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,500
And that's a very common transition, ayat or signs, right?

1265
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
Now the purpose of a sign is what?

1266
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,500
The purpose of a sign is to give you direction.

1267
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,500
The sign says take this exit for the street,

1268
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,500
that tells you here's the sign, here's the exit, right?

1269
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,500
So the purpose of a sign is to guide you to a destination.

1270
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
When Allah says he recites the ayat,

1271
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,500
he gives you the signs that guide you to your destination.

1272
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,500
And what's that destination?

1273
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Anna ila rabbika al-muntaha.

1274
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,500
The final destination is towards your Rabb.

1275
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
You're going to meet with Allah, whether you like it or not,

1276
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,500
whether you intend to or not, you're going to meet with Allah.

1277
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,500
If you want to meet him the right way, this is the right way.

1278
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,500
This is the right way to meet with Allah.

1279
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:31,500
And then, iya nabt wa iya uhu pusnu wa zahruhu.

1280
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,500
This is actually really cool.

1281
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,500
Iya in Arabic comes from the same word as ayah.

1282
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,500
Actually means beauty and blooming.

1283
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,500
Like when a flower blossoms, it's actually called iya ad nabt.

1284
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,500
So the ayat are actually something beautiful.

1285
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,500
And the more you ponder them, the more they blossom,

1286
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
the more they blossom.

1287
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
That's inside of the word ayah.

1288
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
And iyi, I didn't mention iyi.

1289
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
iyi is actually naam.

1290
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,500
In Arabic, you have heard of the word naam before?

1291
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Naam means what?

1292
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Yeah. Okay, good.

1293
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,500
Naam, there's another word in Arabic for yes, which is iyi.

1294
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,500
So if somebody says, hey, did you go to this program?

1295
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,500
iyi is the same as naam.

1296
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,500
Naam, I'm agree. Absolutely yes.

1297
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,500
Which means it is the yes of conviction.

1298
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,500
The ayah will lead to conviction.

1299
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,500
The ayah leads to absolute certainty.

1300
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,500
Yatlua a'aihim a'atii.

1301
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,500
And then, an mu'atadaan yakuna qaaman anything that comes from this root

1302
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
is actually supposed to be something that stays.

1303
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,500
It's permanent.

1304
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
It's not a fad.

1305
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,500
It doesn't go away.

1306
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,500
It's not like Allah will send His ayat and they will disappear.

1307
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,800
They are permanent decrease from Allah. That's all inside the word Aya.

1308
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:54,540
Allah gave us something of meaning, something of purpose, something of wonder, something that calls us directly, something that inspires curiosity,

1309
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:01,960
something that gives us conviction, something that is beautiful, something that blossoms and the messenger will recite this onto the people and it will open up their mind.

1310
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,920
It will make them thoughtful, beautiful people.

1311
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,000
Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi. That's the first step. And

1312
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,320
to end this part of it,

1313
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:19,540
if you were just listening to something, like if you just change radio stations or you open up a random TikTok video or whatever,

1314
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:24,720
you're listening to something, does it necessarily mean that you are seriously learning?

1315
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,880
No, it just means you're exposed.

1316
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,440
If you overhear something, you got exposed, but that doesn't mean you're sitting there taking notes. You're just overheard.

1317
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,920
Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi is actually not education.

1318
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,120
He's just reading all onto, he's sitting, he's standing in a marketplace reading the ayat. Is everybody paying attention?

1319
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,660
No.

1320
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:51,000
He's speaking to the Quraysh reciting the ayat. Does everybody's like, let me listen carefully? No.

1321
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:59,000
They're being exposed even though they're not paying attention or learning or whatever. Some people started listening.

1322
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:06,280
Some people became interested. Some people barely heard anything. Some people hearted and got annoyed, but everybody hears it, right?

1323
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,740
The first step that was given to the Prophet's life for them is make sure every one of these people hears it.

1324
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:19,280
Just read it onto them, expose them to it. Let them react to it. Let them react to it with hate.

1325
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,080
Let them react to it with ignorance. Let them react to it with dismissing. Let them react to it with curiosity.

1326
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,600
That's not up to you. Your first job is what? Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi?

1327
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,920
Ayatihi, this is the part that makes me mad.

1328
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:37,760
It makes me mad because born and raised in a Muslim family and much of the Muslim world,

1329
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,600
when I started learning about the Qur'an,

1330
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,200
actually understanding, even at a basic level, what it says, I was 19 years old and it made me really angry.

1331
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,520
How come I was Muslim for 19 years?

1332
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,360
And

1333
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,360
nobody told me what the Qur'an says.

1334
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,400
Like, I'm Muslim. I

1335
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,000
should know.

1336
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,560
At least I should know what it says from the beginning to the end.

1337
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,640
I should know what it says. Nobody did Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.

1338
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,160
Nobody read the ayahs to me. Like, I didn't know.

1339
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,400
Then I felt like, do other people, am I the only one who like,

1340
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,560
nobody read the ayahs? Let me ask around.

1341
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,880
You do the one of the most sad service you can do, go to any Muslim country, any Muslim community and ask the average Muslim,

1342
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,880
how much of the Qur'an have you?

1343
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,200
Forget read, because reading is extra work. How much of the Qur'an was read to you?

1344
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:40,040
So that you can understand it. Because if you say have you read, then you have to do the work.

1345
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,960
But here, who's doing the work? The Prophet's doing the work and people who interrogate from the Prophet's,

1346
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,440
they're supposed to, the ones who know should read it to the ones who don't know, isn't it?

1347
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,880
So and if we don't know, then we become the ummiyeen.

1348
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:59,200
And the ones who know have to follow the sunnah of the Prophet's, so I said, and do what? Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.

1349
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,280
So I asked, so how many of you heard the Qur'an being explained like, even at a basic level?

1350
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:14,360
Like, Baqarah, I don't know, An-Imran, Resah, Ma'idah, An-Aam, A'raf maybe, Toba, An-Anfal Toba, Yunus, Mood, Yusuf, anything?

1351
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,920
Anything? And you're like, nobody.

1352
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,000
Nobody read the ayahs to me. Nobody talked me through the ayahs.

1353
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,440
I didn't hear it. Isn't this something that's supposed to be heard?

1354
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,440
Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.

1355
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,680
Right? Is this thing, they should read the Qur'an or they should hear the Qur'an?

1356
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,640
This is about hearing, right?

1357
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,680
And this feels to me like disappeared from the ummah.

1358
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,040
This disappeared. You know what took its place?

1359
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,120
The recitation of the Qur'an in beautiful voices, millions and millions and millions of listeners around the world

1360
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,360
are listening to it. But is that Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi?

1361
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,840
No, because you're not listening to it and saying, this is giving me direction.

1362
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,280
You're not wondering about it. You're not being brought close.

1363
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,280
You're not reaching conviction. It's not making you think there's a direction here.

1364
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,280
This is a sign toward something. It's beautiful divine sounds for Barakah.

1365
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,640
And those beautiful sounds were supposed to mean something.

1366
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,480
That would have been Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.

1367
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,080
This is our first failure. When we say, the ummah is going in a bad direction, what do we do?

1368
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,960
Well, the Prophet was given a formula. Here's step one, but I want step 17.

1369
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,160
No, step one, Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.

1370
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:38,000
Just that, I would imagine if I can leave a contribution behind,

1371
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,640
my contribution would be that any of you that have been listening to my work,

1372
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,200
that I've been trying to do for the last 20 or so years,

1373
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,960
that you become people that do this.

1374
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:55,120
And even if you do it among your friends or among your siblings or just among your children,

1375
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,680
but you become the continuation of what the Prophet started when Allah said,

1376
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,640
Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi. Just that.

1377
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,600
Just that. At least expose them. At least they should hear what Allah says.

1378
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,480
At least that much. And then we take the next steps after that.

InshaAllah, ta'ala. So I'm going to end our session for today here at Yatlu aalihi ma yatihi.

1380
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:21,120
And talk about the next steps tomorrow, inshaAllah.

1381
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,760
But I'll open it up for any questions you guys might have.

1382
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,200
Assalamu alaikum everyone. There are almost 50,000 students around the world

1383
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,600
that are interested on top of the students we have in studying the Qur'an and its meanings

1384
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,400
and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.

1385
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,800
And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive.

1386
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,520
So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our sponsorship page.

1387
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,400
I appreciate it so much. And pray that Allah gives our mission success

1388
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,720
and we're able to share the meanings of the Qur'an and the beauty of it the world over.
