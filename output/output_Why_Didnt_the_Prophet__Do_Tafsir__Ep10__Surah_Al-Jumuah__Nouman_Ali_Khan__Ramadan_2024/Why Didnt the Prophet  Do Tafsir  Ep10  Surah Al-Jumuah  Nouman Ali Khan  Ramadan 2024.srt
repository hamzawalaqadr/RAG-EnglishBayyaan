1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
He escapes life bloodied and completely bloodied and muddled and he stands in a corner. He finds a place to pray and

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,760
At the time some jinns were passing by

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,760
So they started listening to the Quran when they finished listening they started commenting on what they just heard

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,160
So they start having this commentary on what they just heard and this commentary is recorded in the Quran

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
But the question is

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,720
Salamu alaikum before you begin this video just quickly wanted to let you know that

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,000
So much of the work on the Quran has been completed on bayna TV

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,160
I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,000
Brief and then in great detail and to do that

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,720
I'd like for you to sign up on bayna TV calm and once you appreciate what's going on in bayna TV

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,880
I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Thank you

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Are we sure you're going to be a

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Siddly I'm ready to go to the next one

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
I'm going to be a

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Siddly

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
I'm going to be a

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Siddly

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
I'm going to be a

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Siddly

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm going to be a

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Siddly

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
I think I'm going to go after fats

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
I'm going to be a

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:57,280
Siddly

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
I'm, I'm not going to theünde

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,760
That's all we're going to do.

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Okay.

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,820
It's just that is that loaded.

31
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,520
I made a new plan with my team.

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,880
Hopefully we can finish ayahs number three to five tomorrow and then five to eight the

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,120
next day and so on.

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,720
We can get to number 11 because the other ayah don't require as much detail, but like I told

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,120
you, this is the central ayah of the surah.

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,520
And I really do want to do it justice.

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,680
In fact, even as I'm trying to do it some justice, I want to start by saying that there's an amazing

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,200
a PhD thesis on the last word of this four phrase, four term phrase al-hikma al-hikma

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,700
meaning wisdom.

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,720
Um, that Dr. Saki Hossein, one of our colleagues at the bayanah team, a research team, he,

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,800
he did a PhD paper on wisdom in the Quran because wisdom is one of the phrases used in this

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
ayah.

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,640
Um, and it's particular to this ayah and just over the entire Quran and in biblical studies

44
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,960
and in Christian studies and philosophy studies and how the Quran deals with the subject of

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,120
wisdom and what it calls wisdom.

46
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,840
So really amazing paper.

47
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,000
It's about 350 pages.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
It's pretty amazing.

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,680
And um, I was going to include some of that in the lecture series here because wisdom

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,960
is coming up, but I decided not to do that because if I did that, the next seven days

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,680
would be just about wisdom.

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,640
So, but what I intend to do after this is done is actually go back to that paper, summarize

53
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,440
it because what I do is I read and research papers like those like PhD level papers, but

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,760
then I make them human so that the rest of us can understand what's being said, right?

55
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,360
So that's kind of what I try to do.

56
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,420
So my intention is in fact to do a series, probably end up doing a YouTube series on

57
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,440
wisdom in the Quran and how to understand wisdom in the Quran and what, what, what does the

58
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,240
Quran mean by wisdom?

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,960
Some of those things will come up today.

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,000
So the warning ahead of time, the disclaimer ahead of time is the discussion I'm having

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,120
today is not comprehensive enough yet.

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,720
It is to the best of my understanding.

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,120
Some of the things that I find the most compelling about the subject of wisdom that we will talk

64
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,520
about that today, but not in a comprehensive way.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
So let's begin again.

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,600
I'm reminding you in IA number two, Allah tells us the Prophet does four things, sallallahu

67
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,560
alayhi wa sallam, that Allah sent his messenger with a four step process.

68
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,820
And we talked about the first step of that process, which was yetlu alayhim ayaatihi.

69
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,380
He reads onto them his miraculous signs, his meaning Allah signs, just a few takeaways

70
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,860
from that first step that I want to finish up from yesterday.

71
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,700
Number one, he brings unfiltered exposure to the revelation exactly as it is.

72
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,820
In other words, when he's reciting the ayaat, he's not saying, here's the ayaa, let me tell

73
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,100
you what this really means.

74
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,540
He's just telling you the ayaa.

75
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,940
The Prophet was reciting the ayaa without an interpretation.

76
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,220
He was just giving them the ayaat directly.

77
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,500
Surat al-Asr was revealed and Abu Lahab and Abu Jahal and whoever heard Surat al-Asr.

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,580
They didn't stop at al-Asr and say, hey, tell me about al-Asr, give me some details.

79
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,580
That's not what happened.

80
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,980
He gave it to them exactly as it is.

81
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,900
Now this is important because in many religious traditions, people don't get the original

82
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,580
message, they get the filtered message by some group.

83
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,220
If it's the Bible, maybe it's the Protestants that are interpreting it and telling it to

84
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,420
their people, the clergymen.

85
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,060
Or if it's the Catholics, they're telling their version.

86
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,180
Or if it's the rabbis, there's some group of rabbis that are interpreting and then telling

87
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
their people.

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,740
And others are telling their interpretation.

89
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,700
So everybody's giving their version of what it might mean against the other version.

90
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,820
You understand?

91
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,300
So people are getting a filtered version of the message.

92
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,180
But the yatlu alayhim ayaati, what does it do?

93
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,660
A direct exposure to the ayaat.

94
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,980
And what does that do?

95
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,180
What that does necessarily is, if you hear the ayaat, you'll say, what does that mean?

96
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,340
Tell me more about this.

97
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,020
I want to know more about this.

98
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,620
You'll become curious.

99
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,220
So it necessarily created curiosity about revelation by design.

100
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
By design.

101
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,180
Like if you hear something interesting, let me give you just, you know, because I come

102
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,420
from the world of business and marketing before, and tech before I got into Islamic stuff.

103
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:10,340
So like in marketing, you first get exposed to, you know, like an ad is supposed to be

104
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
compelling.

105
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,340
Right?

106
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,340
So you see an ad and it should make you curious.

107
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,340
Right?

108
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,140
Or what do they do with movies?

109
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,580
How did they get people to go watch a movie?

110
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,580
They show them a trailer, right?

111
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,380
In which they put the most interesting scenes of the entire movie.

112
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,860
So now you don't really need to watch the movie anymore.

113
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,060
But still, the point is they get you curious, which makes you want to ask questions.

114
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,220
I wonder what happens next.

115
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,340
Or I wonder how this will play out.

116
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,340
It makes you curious.

117
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,020
So yatlu alihimayati, the minimum unfiltered exposure.

118
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,740
Sometimes the unfiltered exposure does raise questions, creates curiosity.

119
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,580
And that is supposed to make people want to say, Hey, if make them interested and make

120
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,020
them want to learn more.

121
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,660
So that's the first thing.

122
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,060
Then it makes revelation accessible.

123
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,260
Like I said, in previous scriptures, previous religions and many religions around the world,

124
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:04,180
the scripture itself, the religious text itself is very, it's very encoded.

125
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,500
And you have to decipher it for the people to be able to access it.

126
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,940
And there has to be a special group of people that can decode it for you.

127
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,860
You cannot access it yourself.

128
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,020
But when he says he went to the Umayyin and he gave them the ayat directly, you see how

129
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,100
he's removing the encoding process.

130
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,220
Along this side, there's somebody who asked me a question.

131
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,900
I was in Minnesota and I was at a gathering and somebody asked me a question, a really

132
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,900
cool question.

133
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,740
They said, How come, you know, how can you interpret the Quran when the Prophet Sallallahu

134
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,900
alayhi wa sallam is already there?

135
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,380
He interpreted the Quran because the way to understand the Quran is through the sunnah

136
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,340
of the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

137
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,860
This is a common misconception.

138
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,180
So let me just tell you how to understand that clearly.

139
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,460
The vast majority of the Quran, the Prophet has no commentary on.

140
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,060
You should know that as a matter of fact.

141
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,940
The vast majority of the Quran, when you study classical Tafsir literature, you study an

142
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,860
ayah, you're not going to find the Prophet commenting on that ayah.

143
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,180
So that's not going to be the case.

144
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,540
That happens on very rare occasions, arguably less than 1% of the time.

145
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,700
Is when you find the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam himself commenting on an ayah.

146
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,780
Of course, there are sayings of the Prophet, alayhi sallam, that seem to be in line with

147
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,380
or seem to help us understand some ayat of the Quran better.

148
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,900
So they sync.

149
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,300
There's a synchronization between sunnah literature and the Quran.

150
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,740
But that doesn't mean the Prophet is actually sitting and doing Tafsir of the Quran directly.

151
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,140
You understand?

152
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,420
So the question that is why didn't he do that?

153
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,060
I mean, he's the best teacher to teach the Quran.

154
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,060
Why didn't he just explain every single ayah of the Quran?

155
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,900
So there's no room for any other kind of interpretation.

156
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,300
The reason he didn't do that is Allah sent this book for people to ask questions.

157
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,620
Allah said this book is for people who will contemplate his ayat,

158
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,620
liya dabburu ayatihi.

159
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,420
If the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam spoke, it's like you have the answer key to every question.

160
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,620
And if the answer key is already there, there's no room for you to think or to contemplate

161
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,420
or to wonder or to ask.

162
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,500
Because once the Prophet is spoken, who's going to speak after that?

163
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,660
There's done with.

164
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,820
There's no need after that, you understand?

165
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,140
But the design of the Quran, the way the Quran was given to the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam

166
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,300
and the way that it spread, it was meant for people to think about what's being said for themselves, directly.

167
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,940
The most extreme case example of that, which I love, so you understand this point,

168
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,380
is when the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was coming back from ta'if.

169
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,660
And if you don't know the story of ta'if, he was nearly killed in ta'if just for introducing Islam.

170
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,780
They got hoodlums from the street, teenagers, rowdy teenagers,

171
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,860
like Stuttgart on Friday night.

172
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:53,460
Right? They got those kinds of kids to just throw rocks at him and bully him and run him down the street.

173
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,140
Right?

174
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:01,180
And when they did that and he was bleeding, he escaped ta'if, bloodied and completely bloodied and muddled

175
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,900
and he stands in a corner, he finds a place to pray.

176
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,420
And he's just praying, reciting Quran out loud.

177
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,940
The Quran was revealed to him and he was reciting it.

178
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:17,580
And at the time, some jinn were passing by and they heard him pray and recite the Quran.

179
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,780
So these jinn were hanging out by themselves.

180
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,300
Like, where were you last speaking?

181
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,020
Jupiter?

182
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,460
The other guy was like, oh, it was at the moon.

183
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,700
Oh, no, no.

184
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,860
And then they're hanging out by them and then they hear, shh, what is that?

185
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,940
And they started listening to the Quran.

186
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:38,300
When they came in the presence of the Quran, they told each other to shut up and listen.

187
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,260
That's what the Quran says.

188
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,820
They told each other, shh, quiet.

189
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,220
Ansaytu means be quiet and listen.

190
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,220
So they started listening to the Quran.

191
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,460
This is Surat al-Ahqaf, by the way, if you're curious.

192
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,980
This is Surah number 46 of the Quran.

193
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,660
And when they finished listening, they started commenting on what they just heard.

194
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,100
In Nasa Me'ana Kitaban Unzila Min Ba'adi Musa.

195
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,260
We just heard a book that was sent down after Musa.

196
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,340
Yahdi ilal Haqq, it guides to the truth.

197
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,740
Wa ila Tariq al-Mustaqeem.

198
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,820
And it guides to a clear, straight path.

199
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,980
So they start having this commentary on what they just heard.

200
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,100
And this commentary is recorded in the Quran.

201
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,620
But the question is, did they learn that commentary from a teacher or they just thought about what they heard?

202
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,660
They just, they heard something and they thought about it and their thoughts were so valuable

203
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,300
that Allah included that in the Quran.

204
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,940
Another example of that is there were some Christians that came to meet the prophets,

205
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,340
al-Allah, on their own.

206
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,260
And the Prophet, Sayyid al-Salam recited some Quran to them.

207
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,580
And when he started reciting the Quran to them, he says,

208
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,180
Allah says,

209
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,740
They started crying when they heard the Quran being recited.

210
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,060
And they said, this is what we recognize from the truth.

211
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,900
And they even said,

212
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,700
We didn't even know it, but we were actually Muslim even before this.

213
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,780
And this feeling of theirs that they had, what did Allah do?

214
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,220
He made that a part of the Quran.

215
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,020
So what is that teaching us?

216
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,100
It's actually teaching us the Quran was designed for people to engage with it

217
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,140
and to react to it and to think about it directly.

218
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,020
You understand?

219
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,020
So this is part of yatlu alayhi mayatihi, making revelation accessible.

220
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,140
Then the other thing is, its source is clear, which is really cool.

221
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,100
When you get really what, why, why did the Christians hear this and they started crying?

222
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,900
Why did the jinn stop talking to each other and start listening to the Quran?

223
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,860
Because they recognize this is from the highest of the heavens, right?

224
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,060
It's from the Aarj.

225
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,140
This is coming from the highest heavens.

226
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,380
This is from Allah Himself, which is actually cool because that's where we began.

227
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,860
Allah created us right under the Aarj and the Jannah and the Jannah and the Ma'wa.

228
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,980
Right near Jannah, we were created in the company of the angels.

229
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,740
Our beginnings are from the same place in the same area where the Quran is coming from.

230
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,540
And so, you know, when you meet someone who has the same origin,

231
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,660
there's some level of familiarity.

232
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,900
There's actually a level of familiarity deep inside a human soul when they hear the word of Allah.

233
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,660
They actually, if you survey thousands of people that took Shahada that accepted Islam,

234
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,100
whether they used to be Hindu or atheist or Christian or Jewish or any other religion and they accepted Islam,

235
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,300
one of the common things you will find among them is,

236
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,260
when I first understood Islam, I felt like this is something I've been feeling all this my whole life.

237
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,540
I feel like it was already there.

238
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,100
You know, it was just telling me something I already knew.

239
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,980
Well, that's actually accurate because when we were created,

240
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,540
Allah introduced Himself to us,

241
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,620
Al-astubi Rabbikum, and now revelation is reintroducing.

242
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,220
And it's actually something we already recognize inside.

243
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,580
What Surat An-Nur describes as Nurun Adanur, light on top of light.

244
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,460
The light we already have and the light of revelation, they meet each other.

245
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,780
Right? So this source being clear and familiar, familiar,

246
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,500
meaning we already knew this deep inside and now it's actually coming back to us again.

247
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,540
This is why we don't have in Islam,

248
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,380
oh, give me the logical proofs of the existence of God and only then I will believe in God.

249
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,020
The Qur'an is actually arguing something deeper than that.

250
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,740
The Qur'an is saying the first evidence of the existence of God already lives inside you.

251
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,620
Deep inside your conscience, there's actually already an acknowledgement of God.

252
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:31,180
And that acknowledgement has been covered by culture and your upbringing and society and corruption and your own sins.

253
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,220
This has been covered up and now all of that's going to get cleaned up by the coming of revelation

254
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,220
and you'll be exposed to what you had deep inside you again.

255
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:45,900
Right? So it's a really interesting philosophical argument about how human beings interact with revelation.

256
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,380
Then the other is, let its miraculous power speak for itself.

257
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,700
This is a long subject. The short version of it is as follows.

258
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,780
The Qur'an is the first time that Allah combined two separate things into one.

259
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:07,540
Before this, like for example, when Allah sent Salih alaihi salam or Hud alaihi salam or Bousa alaihi salam, these prophets of Allah,

260
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,300
then He sent them with a message.

261
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,740
But when they gave their message, Allah also gave them some miracles.

262
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,180
So He gave them two things, a message and miracles.

263
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:25,420
And once you have the miracles, now you have no excuse to reject the message.

264
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,700
Right? So the purpose of the miracle was to validate the message.

265
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,340
Most people already accepted the message, but some people said,

266
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,780
we will not accept it until you show us a miracle and then Allah would show them a miracle and they would still not accept it.

267
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,740
And now that the miracle has been shown, they deserve punishment.

268
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,860
So the miracle was kind of the last resort.

269
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,340
Right? It's not like the prophets didn't come starting off with their message with a miracle.

270
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,780
Like even Musa alaihi salam, when he walked into the Pharaoh's court,

271
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,540
he didn't walk in and throw his stick down and turn it into a snake.

272
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,780
And now let's talk.

273
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,140
That's not what happened.

274
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,380
He talked to him, he gave that.

275
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,620
And when it became clear that no argument is going to help this guy,

276
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,060
then finally he had to what?

277
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,100
Throw the staff and it turns into a snake.

278
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,860
And this is because, in fact, if he didn't do that, he was about to be thrown in jail.

279
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,020
He said, if you take another God besides me,

280
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,300
I will make sure you get imprisoned with the others.

281
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,020
That's when he said,

282
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,060
So miracles were a separate thing.

283
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,460
The message was a separate thing.

284
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,620
What did the Quran do for the first time in human history?

285
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,300
The message and the miracle were one thing.

286
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,260
They're not two separate things.

287
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,100
They're actually the same thing.

288
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,300
So when people said in Makkah, when people said,

289
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,220
Oh, you keep talking about these other prophets who had these miracles.

290
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,140
Where's yours?

291
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,540
You say somebody dead came back to life.

292
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,420
I miss my grandpa.

293
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,540
Can you bring him back?

294
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,220
You say this, you know, the dead bird turned into a living bird,

295
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,420
the clay bird turned into a living bird.

296
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,060
Can you turn this sand and turn into some gold?

297
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,100
We could use some gold around here.

298
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,780
You know, how about you take these rocks and make them into waterfalls?

299
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,980
You know, because you say the Israelites,

300
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,020
when the Moses hit the staff, what happened to the rock?

301
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,460
12 springs, right?

302
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
The Arabs said, we could use some extra water.

303
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,860
I mean, look, it's kind of hot out here.

304
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,020
So why don't you give us at least once?

305
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,420
We're not asking for 12, just give us one.

306
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,660
Just give us one extra water fall around here.

307
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,500
Then you might be interested in accepting your message.

308
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,980
That's a good argument.

309
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,780
And what did Allah respond with when they asked for that miracle?

310
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,780
Allah said,

311
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,500
is that it enough for them that we're giving them the book that's being read onto them?

312
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,700
Meaning Allah is saying this book isn't just a message.

313
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,340
It's also what?

314
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,820
It's a miracle.

315
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,500
And that's why he's telling them, if it's not a miracle,

316
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,380
if it's just any speech, you should be able to make something better.

317
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,420
You should be able to make something that destroys it,

318
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,700
that defeats it,

319
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,380
that doesn't have the effect on people that it has,

320
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,700
that doesn't keep growing the way that it does,

321
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,340
that doesn't penetrate the souls the way that it does.

322
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,900
Bring a surah, like bring 10 surahs.

323
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,300
Okay, now bring 10 surahs.

324
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,460
Bring just a surah.

325
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,100
Okay, 10 is too much for you, just bring one.

326
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,620
Faaatubhi suratain.

327
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,460
You know?

328
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,420
This is actually, so as he was reciting the ayat,

329
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,940
the fact that it's miraculous was also becoming clear to its listeners.

330
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,740
That's why they were scared of it.

331
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,700
So Dr. Samir al-A'ayi said something really interesting in one of his books

332
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,340
about the phenomenon of the Quran.

333
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,980
The Arabs were very well-spoken people.

334
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,140
They were proud of their language.

335
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,020
Right?

336
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,620
And when you say something,

337
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,380
and I know this because I've traveled a lot,

338
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,100
and you know, whenever I go to a community where there are elder Arabs,

339
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,220
my ammuz and my haluz, you know,

340
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,460
they'll say, this was good speech,

341
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,220
but you could have made it better if you did this, this and this.

342
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,820
If you added this ayat, this hadith, oh, it would have been so good.

343
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,820
They're very keen about the speech being better and perfect.

344
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,500
This is missing, this is missing.

345
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,780
And this is what they used to do with each other in poetry.

346
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,860
Right?

347
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,140
You have, you know, you have poetry slams or, you know, rap battles and stuff like that,

348
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,060
where one rapper disses the other one, he roasts the other one,

349
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,180
then the other one roasts him back.

350
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,900
You know what the Arabs, they didn't roast each other.

351
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,140
They did roast too, by the way.

352
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,620
There's classical Arabic roasts.

353
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,340
They're pretty good.

354
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,740
But then there's the other thing.

355
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,340
They would, somebody would make poetry and somebody would come out and say,

356
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,460
oh, it's good, but it could be better.

357
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,940
Like,

358
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,940
like,

359
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
like,

360
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
like,

361
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,940
like,

362
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,940
like,

363
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,940
like,

364
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
like,

365
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,940
like,

366
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
like,

367
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
like,

368
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
like,

369
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
like,

370
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
like,

371
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
like,

372
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
like,

373
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
like,

374
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
like,

375
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
like,

376
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,940
like,

377
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,540
like,

378
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,220
like.

379
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,140
Really?

380
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,220
Why is he to,

381
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
why is he,

382
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,420
why does he choose the dialogueinaudible double,

383
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,340
right?

384
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,240
Why you take their names for this,

385
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,600
they reflect light. She goes, reflect light means they only shine when there's light. You should have said,

386
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:44,360
Yushrekhna, they give off light. Then she says, you said, Abdu'ha, you said they shine during the day.

387
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:51,160
I was like, everything shines during the day. You should have said they shine when? At night time.

388
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,440
And then in his last line of poetry, he said,

389
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,520
Asyaafuna, Yaqtarna min najdat indama. And our swords, they drip with the blood of the enemy.

390
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,960
Asyaafuna, Yaqtarna min najdat indama. You know what that means? We go to so many battles.

391
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,760
We don't even get a chance for our swords to dry up because our swords keep dripping with the blood

392
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,080
of the enemy. That's, he was talking about how brave his tribe is. And she said, Asyaafuna,

393
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,720
you only have like eight swords? So just eight guys go to battle for you? Nine guys? It's less

394
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,880
than this. Jam'aqilla. You should have said, Suyufuna. And you said, Yaqtarna. So you, what do you do?

395
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,200
You cut, you give your enemy paper cuts, your swords drip? If you were real killers,

396
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:41,240
then your sword should have been flowing with the blood of the enemy. Yajreena. And then you said,

397
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,960
Daman. Daman means blood, but it means a drop of blood. You should have said, Dima and rivers of blood.

398
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:54,280
What is this? Get out of here. This is how critical they were of what? Every word. But when they

399
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,200
hear the Quran, because they're so critical, they could have said, What? Asr? Should have said,

400
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,400
What? Dahar? You said, Inna l-insana la fee khusran. You should have said, Inna nasa la fee khusran.

401
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,520
Should have used a different word. Did anybody say that? Abu Jahal is there. Abu Lahab is there.

402
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,560
Walid bin Mughidah is there. Some of their best poets are there. Their rap battle winners are there

403
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,960
from last year. Everybody's there and nobody says a word. How come? And then they say,

404
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:29,240
He's crazy. He's a poet. He's a magician. Wait, if he's a magician, then what's the magic trick?

405
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,760
If he's crazy, then why are people so impressed? And if he is a poet, then you should be able to

406
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:45,320
come up with much better poetry. Okay, we see something. I don't know what he is. Somebody

407
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:53,320
else is teaching him. You know, he's being dictated to. People, somebody else, we don't know who it

408
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,600
is, but somebody's teaching him. And you know what the public was seeing? We've never seen

409
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:07,160
our intellectuals so baffled. We've never seen them. So this is not being defeated.

410
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,400
Its miraculous power was speaking for itself. And then finally, people may now recognize the

411
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,040
ayat or all around them. This is really cool. The word ayah, I talked to you about that yesterday,

412
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,600
right? The Quran doesn't just use the word ayah for the statements in the Quran. Those are ayat

413
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,600
too. I don't use the word verses. I don't like it. I just use ayat. And I've explained in other

414
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,200
lectures why I don't use the word verse because verse sounds like poetry. Right, and verse also

415
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,800
sounds like biblical, but the Quran doesn't actually have poetic or biblical references. It's

416
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,280
actually a unique structure by itself. So just ayat. A divine sign, a miraculous sign, that's

417
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:56,120
what I call it. Anyway, the Quran didn't just reveal what Allah says about prophets or about

418
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,400
heaven and hell, etc. Allah teaches me that there's an ayah inside the tree. There's an

419
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,720
ayah inside the cloud. There's an ayah inside the camel. There's an ayah inside the desert.

420
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,400
There's an ayah in the sun. There's an ayah in the moon. There's an ayah night and day. There's

421
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,560
an ayah inside me. There's an ayah in marriage. There's an ayah in the differences in people's

422
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,960
tongues and languages. There's an ayah in people's different skin colors. All of these are also what?

423
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,360
Ayat. They have ayat in them, all of them. This is what Allah keeps saying. Now, what did he do?

424
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,600
He made me think, oh, I thought I was studying the ayat when I was reading the book,

425
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,960
because the book is made up of ayat. But then he's telling me that has an ayah in it. That has an

426
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,360
ayah in it. That has an ayah in it. That has an ayah in it. You know what that does? I'm in the

427
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:45,080
ayat when I'm in the book. And I'm also in the ayat when I'm outside the book and I never knew.

428
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,360
I thought it was just a tree. Now I know it's actually an ayah. I thought it was just a camel.

429
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,520
That's actually an ayah. But then the Quran teaches you and teaches me how is that an ayah?

430
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:04,200
How is the wind an ayah? How is the sun an ayah? Without it, I could learn a lot about the sun

431
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,520
in science class. But I won't learn that it is what? It's an ayah. The Quran came and changed the

432
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:18,040
world around me and I started seeing ayat everywhere. And the more ayat I see in the world, it takes me

433
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:24,520
back to what he teaches me about those ayat. And the more I read the Quran, it makes me go back into

434
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,880
the universe and explore those ayat. So those ayat pulled me back towards these ayat and these

435
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,800
ayat pushed me back towards those ayat and they keep going between the ayat. So when the Prophet

436
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,760
ﷺ is reciting the ayat to them, he's changing their worldview. People now recognize that ayat

437
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,960
are all around them. This is a very powerful phrase that's used as the opening statement of these four

438
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:53,960
steps. Assalamu alaikum everyone. There are almost 50,000 students around the world that are interested

439
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,280
on top of the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to learn

440
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,120
that and share that with family and friends and they need sponsorships which is not very

441
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,080
expensive. So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our sponsorship

442
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,920
page. I appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're able to share

443
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,960
the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it the world over.
