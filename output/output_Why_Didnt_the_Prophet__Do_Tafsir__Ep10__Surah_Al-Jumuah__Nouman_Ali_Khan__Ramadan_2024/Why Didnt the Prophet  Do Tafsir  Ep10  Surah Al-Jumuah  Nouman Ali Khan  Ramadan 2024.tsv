0	7520	He escapes life bloodied and completely bloodied and muddled and he stands in a corner. He finds a place to pray and
8080	11760	At the time some jinns were passing by
12360	17760	So they started listening to the Quran when they finished listening they started commenting on what they just heard
18000	25160	So they start having this commentary on what they just heard and this commentary is recorded in the Quran
26240	28240	But the question is
31000	35720	Salamu alaikum before you begin this video just quickly wanted to let you know that
36080	39000	So much of the work on the Quran has been completed on bayna TV
39000	43160	I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in
43320	46000	Brief and then in great detail and to do that
46000	50720	I'd like for you to sign up on bayna TV calm and once you appreciate what's going on in bayna TV
50720	55880	I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also
55880	57880	Thank you
60000	62000	You
78960	79960	Are we sure you're going to be a
79960	81960	Siddly I'm ready to go to the next one
81960	82960	I'm going to be a
82960	83960	Siddly
83960	84960	I'm going to be a
84960	85960	Siddly
85960	86960	I'm going to be a
86960	87960	Siddly
87960	88960	I'm going to be a
88960	89960	Siddly
90000	92960	I think I'm going to go after fats
92960	93960	I'm going to be a
93960	117280	Siddly
117280	118880	I'm, I'm not going to the√ºnde
118880	120760	That's all we're going to do.
120760	121760	Okay.
121760	123820	It's just that is that loaded.
123820	125520	I made a new plan with my team.
125520	130880	Hopefully we can finish ayahs number three to five tomorrow and then five to eight the
130880	132120	next day and so on.
132120	136720	We can get to number 11 because the other ayah don't require as much detail, but like I told
136720	139120	you, this is the central ayah of the surah.
139120	140520	And I really do want to do it justice.
140520	145680	In fact, even as I'm trying to do it some justice, I want to start by saying that there's an amazing
145680	152200	a PhD thesis on the last word of this four phrase, four term phrase al-hikma al-hikma
152200	153700	meaning wisdom.
153700	159720	Um, that Dr. Saki Hossein, one of our colleagues at the bayanah team, a research team, he,
159720	164800	he did a PhD paper on wisdom in the Quran because wisdom is one of the phrases used in this
164800	165800	ayah.
165800	170640	Um, and it's particular to this ayah and just over the entire Quran and in biblical studies
170640	174960	and in Christian studies and philosophy studies and how the Quran deals with the subject of
174960	177120	wisdom and what it calls wisdom.
177120	178840	So really amazing paper.
178840	181000	It's about 350 pages.
181000	182280	It's pretty amazing.
182280	187680	And um, I was going to include some of that in the lecture series here because wisdom
187680	191960	is coming up, but I decided not to do that because if I did that, the next seven days
191960	193680	would be just about wisdom.
193680	199640	So, but what I intend to do after this is done is actually go back to that paper, summarize
199640	205440	it because what I do is I read and research papers like those like PhD level papers, but
205440	211760	then I make them human so that the rest of us can understand what's being said, right?
211760	214360	So that's kind of what I try to do.
214360	218420	So my intention is in fact to do a series, probably end up doing a YouTube series on
218420	223440	wisdom in the Quran and how to understand wisdom in the Quran and what, what, what does the
223440	225240	Quran mean by wisdom?
225240	226960	Some of those things will come up today.
226960	231000	So the warning ahead of time, the disclaimer ahead of time is the discussion I'm having
231000	234120	today is not comprehensive enough yet.
234120	235720	It is to the best of my understanding.
235720	240120	Some of the things that I find the most compelling about the subject of wisdom that we will talk
240120	242520	about that today, but not in a comprehensive way.
242520	243520	So let's begin again.
243520	248600	I'm reminding you in IA number two, Allah tells us the Prophet does four things, sallallahu
248600	252560	alayhi wa sallam, that Allah sent his messenger with a four step process.
252560	256820	And we talked about the first step of that process, which was yetlu alayhim ayaatihi.
256820	262380	He reads onto them his miraculous signs, his meaning Allah signs, just a few takeaways
262380	265860	from that first step that I want to finish up from yesterday.
265860	270700	Number one, he brings unfiltered exposure to the revelation exactly as it is.
270700	274820	In other words, when he's reciting the ayaat, he's not saying, here's the ayaa, let me tell
274820	276100	you what this really means.
276100	277540	He's just telling you the ayaa.
277540	280940	The Prophet was reciting the ayaa without an interpretation.
280940	283220	He was just giving them the ayaat directly.
283220	288500	Surat al-Asr was revealed and Abu Lahab and Abu Jahal and whoever heard Surat al-Asr.
288500	292580	They didn't stop at al-Asr and say, hey, tell me about al-Asr, give me some details.
292580	293580	That's not what happened.
293580	295980	He gave it to them exactly as it is.
295980	301900	Now this is important because in many religious traditions, people don't get the original
301900	307580	message, they get the filtered message by some group.
307580	311220	If it's the Bible, maybe it's the Protestants that are interpreting it and telling it to
311220	313420	their people, the clergymen.
313420	316060	Or if it's the Catholics, they're telling their version.
316060	319180	Or if it's the rabbis, there's some group of rabbis that are interpreting and then telling
319180	320180	their people.
320180	321740	And others are telling their interpretation.
321740	326700	So everybody's giving their version of what it might mean against the other version.
326700	327820	You understand?
327820	331300	So people are getting a filtered version of the message.
331300	333180	But the yatlu alayhim ayaati, what does it do?
333180	336660	A direct exposure to the ayaat.
336660	337980	And what does that do?
337980	343180	What that does necessarily is, if you hear the ayaat, you'll say, what does that mean?
343180	344340	Tell me more about this.
344340	346020	I want to know more about this.
346020	347620	You'll become curious.
347620	353220	So it necessarily created curiosity about revelation by design.
353220	354220	By design.
354220	357180	Like if you hear something interesting, let me give you just, you know, because I come
357180	363420	from the world of business and marketing before, and tech before I got into Islamic stuff.
363420	370340	So like in marketing, you first get exposed to, you know, like an ad is supposed to be
370340	371340	compelling.
371340	372340	Right?
372340	374340	So you see an ad and it should make you curious.
374340	375340	Right?
375340	377140	Or what do they do with movies?
377140	378580	How did they get people to go watch a movie?
378580	380580	They show them a trailer, right?
380580	383380	In which they put the most interesting scenes of the entire movie.
383380	385860	So now you don't really need to watch the movie anymore.
385860	391060	But still, the point is they get you curious, which makes you want to ask questions.
391060	393220	I wonder what happens next.
393220	395340	Or I wonder how this will play out.
395340	396340	It makes you curious.
396340	400020	So yatlu alihimayati, the minimum unfiltered exposure.
400020	403740	Sometimes the unfiltered exposure does raise questions, creates curiosity.
403740	407580	And that is supposed to make people want to say, Hey, if make them interested and make
407580	409020	them want to learn more.
409020	410660	So that's the first thing.
410660	413060	Then it makes revelation accessible.
413060	417260	Like I said, in previous scriptures, previous religions and many religions around the world,
417260	424180	the scripture itself, the religious text itself is very, it's very encoded.
424180	428500	And you have to decipher it for the people to be able to access it.
428500	431940	And there has to be a special group of people that can decode it for you.
431940	433860	You cannot access it yourself.
433860	439020	But when he says he went to the Umayyin and he gave them the ayat directly, you see how
439020	443100	he's removing the encoding process.
443100	445220	Along this side, there's somebody who asked me a question.
445220	448900	I was in Minnesota and I was at a gathering and somebody asked me a question, a really
448900	449900	cool question.
449900	453740	They said, How come, you know, how can you interpret the Quran when the Prophet Sallallahu
453740	454900	alayhi wa sallam is already there?
454900	459380	He interpreted the Quran because the way to understand the Quran is through the sunnah
459380	461340	of the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
461340	462860	This is a common misconception.
462860	465180	So let me just tell you how to understand that clearly.
465180	469460	The vast majority of the Quran, the Prophet has no commentary on.
469460	472060	You should know that as a matter of fact.
472060	476940	The vast majority of the Quran, when you study classical Tafsir literature, you study an
476940	479860	ayah, you're not going to find the Prophet commenting on that ayah.
479860	482180	So that's not going to be the case.
482180	487540	That happens on very rare occasions, arguably less than 1% of the time.
487540	491700	Is when you find the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam himself commenting on an ayah.
491700	497780	Of course, there are sayings of the Prophet, alayhi sallam, that seem to be in line with
497780	501380	or seem to help us understand some ayat of the Quran better.
501380	502900	So they sync.
502900	506300	There's a synchronization between sunnah literature and the Quran.
506300	511740	But that doesn't mean the Prophet is actually sitting and doing Tafsir of the Quran directly.
511740	513140	You understand?
513140	515420	So the question that is why didn't he do that?
515420	518060	I mean, he's the best teacher to teach the Quran.
518060	521060	Why didn't he just explain every single ayah of the Quran?
521060	524900	So there's no room for any other kind of interpretation.
524900	528300	The reason he didn't do that is Allah sent this book for people to ask questions.
528420	533620	Allah said this book is for people who will contemplate his ayat,
533620	535620	liya dabburu ayatihi.
535620	541420	If the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam spoke, it's like you have the answer key to every question.
541420	546620	And if the answer key is already there, there's no room for you to think or to contemplate
546620	548420	or to wonder or to ask.
548420	552500	Because once the Prophet is spoken, who's going to speak after that?
552500	553660	There's done with.
553660	555820	There's no need after that, you understand?
555940	560140	But the design of the Quran, the way the Quran was given to the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam
560140	566300	and the way that it spread, it was meant for people to think about what's being said for themselves, directly.
566300	570940	The most extreme case example of that, which I love, so you understand this point,
570940	574380	is when the Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was coming back from ta'if.
574380	579660	And if you don't know the story of ta'if, he was nearly killed in ta'if just for introducing Islam.
579660	583780	They got hoodlums from the street, teenagers, rowdy teenagers,
583820	585860	like Stuttgart on Friday night.
585860	593460	Right? They got those kinds of kids to just throw rocks at him and bully him and run him down the street.
593460	594140	Right?
594140	601180	And when they did that and he was bleeding, he escaped ta'if, bloodied and completely bloodied and muddled
601180	604900	and he stands in a corner, he finds a place to pray.
604900	607420	And he's just praying, reciting Quran out loud.
607420	609940	The Quran was revealed to him and he was reciting it.
609980	617580	And at the time, some jinn were passing by and they heard him pray and recite the Quran.
617580	620780	So these jinn were hanging out by themselves.
620780	622300	Like, where were you last speaking?
622300	623020	Jupiter?
623020	624460	The other guy was like, oh, it was at the moon.
624460	625700	Oh, no, no.
625700	629860	And then they're hanging out by them and then they hear, shh, what is that?
629860	631940	And they started listening to the Quran.
631940	638300	When they came in the presence of the Quran, they told each other to shut up and listen.
638340	639260	That's what the Quran says.
639260	640820	They told each other, shh, quiet.
640820	643220	Ansaytu means be quiet and listen.
643220	645220	So they started listening to the Quran.
645220	647460	This is Surat al-Ahqaf, by the way, if you're curious.
647460	649980	This is Surah number 46 of the Quran.
649980	655660	And when they finished listening, they started commenting on what they just heard.
655660	658100	In Nasa Me'ana Kitaban Unzila Min Ba'adi Musa.
658100	661260	We just heard a book that was sent down after Musa.
661260	663340	Yahdi ilal Haqq, it guides to the truth.
663340	664740	Wa ila Tariq al-Mustaqeem.
664740	667820	And it guides to a clear, straight path.
667820	671980	So they start having this commentary on what they just heard.
671980	676100	And this commentary is recorded in the Quran.
676100	682620	But the question is, did they learn that commentary from a teacher or they just thought about what they heard?
682620	686660	They just, they heard something and they thought about it and their thoughts were so valuable
686660	689300	that Allah included that in the Quran.
689300	692940	Another example of that is there were some Christians that came to meet the prophets,
692940	694340	al-Allah, on their own.
694340	697260	And the Prophet, Sayyid al-Salam recited some Quran to them.
697300	700580	And when he started reciting the Quran to them, he says,
700580	701180	Allah says,
705500	708740	They started crying when they heard the Quran being recited.
708740	712060	And they said, this is what we recognize from the truth.
712060	712900	And they even said,
717100	720700	We didn't even know it, but we were actually Muslim even before this.
720700	724780	And this feeling of theirs that they had, what did Allah do?
724780	727220	He made that a part of the Quran.
727900	729020	So what is that teaching us?
729020	733100	It's actually teaching us the Quran was designed for people to engage with it
733100	736140	and to react to it and to think about it directly.
736140	737020	You understand?
737020	742020	So this is part of yatlu alayhi mayatihi, making revelation accessible.
742020	746140	Then the other thing is, its source is clear, which is really cool.
746140	751100	When you get really what, why, why did the Christians hear this and they started crying?
751100	754900	Why did the jinn stop talking to each other and start listening to the Quran?
754940	758860	Because they recognize this is from the highest of the heavens, right?
758860	760060	It's from the Aarj.
760060	762140	This is coming from the highest heavens.
762140	767380	This is from Allah Himself, which is actually cool because that's where we began.
767380	771860	Allah created us right under the Aarj and the Jannah and the Jannah and the Ma'wa.
771860	774980	Right near Jannah, we were created in the company of the angels.
774980	780740	Our beginnings are from the same place in the same area where the Quran is coming from.
780740	784540	And so, you know, when you meet someone who has the same origin,
784580	786660	there's some level of familiarity.
786660	791900	There's actually a level of familiarity deep inside a human soul when they hear the word of Allah.
791900	796660	They actually, if you survey thousands of people that took Shahada that accepted Islam,
796660	802100	whether they used to be Hindu or atheist or Christian or Jewish or any other religion and they accepted Islam,
802100	804300	one of the common things you will find among them is,
804300	810260	when I first understood Islam, I felt like this is something I've been feeling all this my whole life.
810260	812540	I feel like it was already there.
812540	815100	You know, it was just telling me something I already knew.
815100	818980	Well, that's actually accurate because when we were created,
818980	820540	Allah introduced Himself to us,
820540	823620	Al-astubi Rabbikum, and now revelation is reintroducing.
823620	826220	And it's actually something we already recognize inside.
826220	830580	What Surat An-Nur describes as Nurun Adanur, light on top of light.
830580	833460	The light we already have and the light of revelation, they meet each other.
833460	837780	Right? So this source being clear and familiar, familiar,
837780	842500	meaning we already knew this deep inside and now it's actually coming back to us again.
842540	844540	This is why we don't have in Islam,
844540	849380	oh, give me the logical proofs of the existence of God and only then I will believe in God.
849380	852020	The Qur'an is actually arguing something deeper than that.
852020	857740	The Qur'an is saying the first evidence of the existence of God already lives inside you.
857740	862620	Deep inside your conscience, there's actually already an acknowledgement of God.
862620	871180	And that acknowledgement has been covered by culture and your upbringing and society and corruption and your own sins.
871220	876220	This has been covered up and now all of that's going to get cleaned up by the coming of revelation
876220	879220	and you'll be exposed to what you had deep inside you again.
879220	885900	Right? So it's a really interesting philosophical argument about how human beings interact with revelation.
885900	889380	Then the other is, let its miraculous power speak for itself.
889380	893700	This is a long subject. The short version of it is as follows.
893700	899780	The Qur'an is the first time that Allah combined two separate things into one.
899820	907540	Before this, like for example, when Allah sent Salih alaihi salam or Hud alaihi salam or Bousa alaihi salam, these prophets of Allah,
907540	910300	then He sent them with a message.
910300	915740	But when they gave their message, Allah also gave them some miracles.
915740	919180	So He gave them two things, a message and miracles.
919180	925420	And once you have the miracles, now you have no excuse to reject the message.
925460	930700	Right? So the purpose of the miracle was to validate the message.
930700	933340	Most people already accepted the message, but some people said,
933340	939780	we will not accept it until you show us a miracle and then Allah would show them a miracle and they would still not accept it.
939780	942740	And now that the miracle has been shown, they deserve punishment.
942740	945860	So the miracle was kind of the last resort.
945860	951340	Right? It's not like the prophets didn't come starting off with their message with a miracle.
951380	954780	Like even Musa alaihi salam, when he walked into the Pharaoh's court,
954780	958540	he didn't walk in and throw his stick down and turn it into a snake.
958540	960780	And now let's talk.
960780	962140	That's not what happened.
962140	963380	He talked to him, he gave that.
963380	968620	And when it became clear that no argument is going to help this guy,
968620	971060	then finally he had to what?
971060	974100	Throw the staff and it turns into a snake.
974100	978860	And this is because, in fact, if he didn't do that, he was about to be thrown in jail.
978900	983020	He said, if you take another God besides me,
983020	987300	I will make sure you get imprisoned with the others.
987300	988020	That's when he said,
991540	994060	So miracles were a separate thing.
994060	996460	The message was a separate thing.
996460	999620	What did the Quran do for the first time in human history?
999620	1002300	The message and the miracle were one thing.
1002300	1004260	They're not two separate things.
1004260	1006100	They're actually the same thing.
1006140	1008300	So when people said in Makkah, when people said,
1008300	1012220	Oh, you keep talking about these other prophets who had these miracles.
1012220	1014140	Where's yours?
1014140	1017540	You say somebody dead came back to life.
1017540	1018420	I miss my grandpa.
1018420	1020540	Can you bring him back?
1020540	1024220	You say this, you know, the dead bird turned into a living bird,
1024220	1026420	the clay bird turned into a living bird.
1026420	1029060	Can you turn this sand and turn into some gold?
1029060	1031100	We could use some gold around here.
1031100	1034780	You know, how about you take these rocks and make them into waterfalls?
1034860	1038980	You know, because you say the Israelites,
1038980	1042020	when the Moses hit the staff, what happened to the rock?
1042020	1043460	12 springs, right?
1043460	1045460	The Arabs said, we could use some extra water.
1045460	1046860	I mean, look, it's kind of hot out here.
1046860	1049020	So why don't you give us at least once?
1049020	1051420	We're not asking for 12, just give us one.
1051420	1053660	Just give us one extra water fall around here.
1053660	1057500	Then you might be interested in accepting your message.
1057500	1058980	That's a good argument.
1058980	1061780	And what did Allah respond with when they asked for that miracle?
1061780	1062780	Allah said,
1062780	1068500	is that it enough for them that we're giving them the book that's being read onto them?
1068500	1070700	Meaning Allah is saying this book isn't just a message.
1070700	1072340	It's also what?
1072340	1073820	It's a miracle.
1073820	1077500	And that's why he's telling them, if it's not a miracle,
1077500	1081380	if it's just any speech, you should be able to make something better.
1081380	1084420	You should be able to make something that destroys it,
1084420	1085700	that defeats it,
1085700	1088380	that doesn't have the effect on people that it has,
1088380	1090700	that doesn't keep growing the way that it does,
1090740	1093340	that doesn't penetrate the souls the way that it does.
1093340	1094900	Bring a surah, like bring 10 surahs.
1094900	1096300	Okay, now bring 10 surahs.
1096300	1098460	Bring just a surah.
1098460	1101100	Okay, 10 is too much for you, just bring one.
1101100	1102620	Faaatubhi suratain.
1102620	1103460	You know?
1103460	1108420	This is actually, so as he was reciting the ayat,
1108420	1112940	the fact that it's miraculous was also becoming clear to its listeners.
1112940	1114740	That's why they were scared of it.
1114740	1117700	So Dr. Samir al-A'ayi said something really interesting in one of his books
1117700	1120340	about the phenomenon of the Quran.
1120340	1122980	The Arabs were very well-spoken people.
1122980	1125140	They were proud of their language.
1125140	1126020	Right?
1126020	1128620	And when you say something,
1128620	1130380	and I know this because I've traveled a lot,
1130380	1134100	and you know, whenever I go to a community where there are elder Arabs,
1134100	1137220	my ammuz and my haluz, you know,
1137220	1138460	they'll say, this was good speech,
1138460	1142220	but you could have made it better if you did this, this and this.
1142220	1145820	If you added this ayat, this hadith, oh, it would have been so good.
1146820	1151820	They're very keen about the speech being better and perfect.
1151820	1154500	This is missing, this is missing.
1154500	1156780	And this is what they used to do with each other in poetry.
1156780	1157860	Right?
1157860	1163140	You have, you know, you have poetry slams or, you know, rap battles and stuff like that,
1163140	1166060	where one rapper disses the other one, he roasts the other one,
1166060	1167180	then the other one roasts him back.
1167180	1168900	You know what the Arabs, they didn't roast each other.
1168900	1170140	They did roast too, by the way.
1170140	1171620	There's classical Arabic roasts.
1171620	1172340	They're pretty good.
1173340	1175740	But then there's the other thing.
1175740	1178340	They would, somebody would make poetry and somebody would come out and say,
1178340	1181460	oh, it's good, but it could be better.
1181460	1182940	Like,
1182940	1183940	like,
1183940	1184940	like,
1184940	1185940	like,
1185940	1186940	like,
1186940	1187940	like,
1187940	1188940	like,
1188940	1189940	like,
1189940	1190940	like,
1190940	1191940	like,
1191940	1192940	like,
1192940	1193940	like,
1193940	1194940	like,
1194940	1195940	like,
1195940	1196940	like,
1196940	1197940	like,
1197940	1198940	like,
1198940	1199940	like,
1199940	1200940	like,
1200940	1201940	like,
1201940	1203540	like,
1204740	1206220	like.
1212140	1213140	Really?
1216820	1218220	Why is he to,
1218220	1219220	why is he,
1221540	1223420	why does he choose the dialogueinaudible double,
1228140	1229340	right?
1229340	1231240	Why you take their names for this,
1231240	1236600	they reflect light. She goes, reflect light means they only shine when there's light. You should have said,
1236600	1244360	Yushrekhna, they give off light. Then she says, you said, Abdu'ha, you said they shine during the day.
1244360	1251160	I was like, everything shines during the day. You should have said they shine when? At night time.
1252680	1254440	And then in his last line of poetry, he said,
1254440	1260520	Asyaafuna, Yaqtarna min najdat indama. And our swords, they drip with the blood of the enemy.
1261240	1265960	Asyaafuna, Yaqtarna min najdat indama. You know what that means? We go to so many battles.
1265960	1270760	We don't even get a chance for our swords to dry up because our swords keep dripping with the blood
1270760	1275080	of the enemy. That's, he was talking about how brave his tribe is. And she said, Asyaafuna,
1275880	1281720	you only have like eight swords? So just eight guys go to battle for you? Nine guys? It's less
1281800	1287880	than this. Jam'aqilla. You should have said, Suyufuna. And you said, Yaqtarna. So you, what do you do?
1287880	1294200	You cut, you give your enemy paper cuts, your swords drip? If you were real killers,
1294200	1301240	then your sword should have been flowing with the blood of the enemy. Yajreena. And then you said,
1301240	1305960	Daman. Daman means blood, but it means a drop of blood. You should have said, Dima and rivers of blood.
1306920	1314280	What is this? Get out of here. This is how critical they were of what? Every word. But when they
1314280	1318200	hear the Quran, because they're so critical, they could have said, What? Asr? Should have said,
1318200	1323400	What? Dahar? You said, Inna l-insana la fee khusran. You should have said, Inna nasa la fee khusran.
1324040	1328520	Should have used a different word. Did anybody say that? Abu Jahal is there. Abu Lahab is there.
1328520	1333560	Walid bin Mughidah is there. Some of their best poets are there. Their rap battle winners are there
1333560	1339960	from last year. Everybody's there and nobody says a word. How come? And then they say,
1339960	1349240	He's crazy. He's a poet. He's a magician. Wait, if he's a magician, then what's the magic trick?
1350440	1356760	If he's crazy, then why are people so impressed? And if he is a poet, then you should be able to
1356760	1365320	come up with much better poetry. Okay, we see something. I don't know what he is. Somebody
1365320	1373320	else is teaching him. You know, he's being dictated to. People, somebody else, we don't know who it
1373320	1380600	is, but somebody's teaching him. And you know what the public was seeing? We've never seen
1380680	1387160	our intellectuals so baffled. We've never seen them. So this is not being defeated.
1387160	1393400	Its miraculous power was speaking for itself. And then finally, people may now recognize the
1393400	1398040	ayat or all around them. This is really cool. The word ayah, I talked to you about that yesterday,
1398040	1404600	right? The Quran doesn't just use the word ayah for the statements in the Quran. Those are ayat
1404600	1410600	too. I don't use the word verses. I don't like it. I just use ayat. And I've explained in other
1410600	1416200	lectures why I don't use the word verse because verse sounds like poetry. Right, and verse also
1416200	1421800	sounds like biblical, but the Quran doesn't actually have poetic or biblical references. It's
1421800	1428280	actually a unique structure by itself. So just ayat. A divine sign, a miraculous sign, that's
1428280	1436120	what I call it. Anyway, the Quran didn't just reveal what Allah says about prophets or about
1436920	1441400	heaven and hell, etc. Allah teaches me that there's an ayah inside the tree. There's an
1441400	1445720	ayah inside the cloud. There's an ayah inside the camel. There's an ayah inside the desert.
1445720	1449400	There's an ayah in the sun. There's an ayah in the moon. There's an ayah night and day. There's
1449400	1453560	an ayah inside me. There's an ayah in marriage. There's an ayah in the differences in people's
1453640	1459960	tongues and languages. There's an ayah in people's different skin colors. All of these are also what?
1459960	1464360	Ayat. They have ayat in them, all of them. This is what Allah keeps saying. Now, what did he do?
1464920	1468600	He made me think, oh, I thought I was studying the ayat when I was reading the book,
1468600	1473960	because the book is made up of ayat. But then he's telling me that has an ayah in it. That has an
1473960	1478360	ayah in it. That has an ayah in it. That has an ayah in it. You know what that does? I'm in the
1478360	1485080	ayat when I'm in the book. And I'm also in the ayat when I'm outside the book and I never knew.
1485080	1490360	I thought it was just a tree. Now I know it's actually an ayah. I thought it was just a camel.
1491080	1496520	That's actually an ayah. But then the Quran teaches you and teaches me how is that an ayah?
1497560	1504200	How is the wind an ayah? How is the sun an ayah? Without it, I could learn a lot about the sun
1504200	1510520	in science class. But I won't learn that it is what? It's an ayah. The Quran came and changed the
1510520	1518040	world around me and I started seeing ayat everywhere. And the more ayat I see in the world, it takes me
1518040	1524520	back to what he teaches me about those ayat. And the more I read the Quran, it makes me go back into
1524520	1529880	the universe and explore those ayat. So those ayat pulled me back towards these ayat and these
1529880	1535800	ayat pushed me back towards those ayat and they keep going between the ayat. So when the Prophet
1535800	1540760	Ô∑∫ is reciting the ayat to them, he's changing their worldview. People now recognize that ayat
1540760	1545960	are all around them. This is a very powerful phrase that's used as the opening statement of these four
1545960	1553960	steps. Assalamu alaikum everyone. There are almost 50,000 students around the world that are interested
1553960	1558280	on top of the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to learn
1558360	1562120	that and share that with family and friends and they need sponsorships which is not very
1562120	1567080	expensive. So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV, please do so and visit our sponsorship
1567080	1570920	page. I appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're able to share
1570920	1573960	the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it the world over.
