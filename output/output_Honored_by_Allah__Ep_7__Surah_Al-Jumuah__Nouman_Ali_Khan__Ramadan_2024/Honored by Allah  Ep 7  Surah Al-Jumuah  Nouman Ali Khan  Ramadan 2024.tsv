0	6060	Sometimes you have people at the at the restaurant can I have some ketchup? We don't allow that here. We don't give extra ketchup
7440	8640	Really
8640	14040	Read the sign. I saw you give it to your cousin. It was about right before you give him four extra ketchups
14040	18140	You can't give me a ketchup. I know you have the Aiza and you're acting like you're working under the milk
20080	22080	The strangest of seed of Quran
22680	24680	Now
27960	31440	Let's move on to al-Azeez you got work to do so
32080	36400	Al-Azeez is one of the most common names of Allah. It comes from
37080	39080	Earth actually
39600	43440	Azaza Azaza ma'zuza. This is all used for tough ground
44040	49600	Like you know earth you can dig in too easily. That's not arda Aziz or Azaz or Azza
49600	57480	But earth that's made of rock and you can't break through, you know tough earth. That's actually called Azaz unbreakable soil
58360	62120	Unbreakable land like rocky land. That's called arda ma'zuza
62640	68760	Farasul mu'tazza was used in mu'tazza as the attribute here for a horse that has very strong muscles
68960	72320	Like it's rock solid. It's built like that. That's called mu'tazza
72320	78800	And then sometimes they had a camel that had a disease where its muscles become stiff like muscle atrophy
79160	82480	Right and when it became so stiff you couldn't milk the camel
82480	87280	You couldn't get the milk because its muscles are all tightened up and that was actually called naqatun azuz
87840	94640	Because it became so tough. So the common theme you're learning is rocks that are tough muscles that are tough muscles that have become stiff
94640	99320	The eqatun ahali. This is mistycle mistycle. Ahali min shiddati nasiji tahmiha
99320	104800	It's because because of the tightness or the atrophy of the muscles. You cannot get milk out of the camel
104800	108440	Okay, al-Azeez also means the elevation of rank
109000	111000	so if you went from
111800	117000	Internship to manager to executive manager to director you are increasing in is
117440	122120	You're increasing in your rank in your company an invincible person
122120	124960	Let me explain what invisible here means nobody can take you down
125400	129720	Nobody can attack you. Nobody can challenge your position if you're in an untouchable position
130280	132280	Then you are called al-Azeez
132840	135800	Al-Azeez one one punch man in his cartoon show is
136440	142820	Aziz, okay, so if you want to buy analogy if you'd like to you know, so Superman without kryptonite
143600	146680	Is Aziz until Kryptonite shows up or the Hulk or so?
146680	152040	I don't know what but these are examples of somebody who's invincible can't be broken can't be defeated, right?
152040	156120	And that's called al-Azeez al-qawee al-shadeed al-ghaalab al-ladila yuhaalab
156200	160200	There's the strong one that wins every time and cannot be won over
160520	165160	Maa la yumkin this type of my mother you can't will soon we're a he met the house and Aziz
165160	167920	It's also used for something that is impossible to
168520	174680	Beat like they use it for a castle or a fort, you know castles used to have these walls outside
175280	179960	Right so that armies can't just walk in they have to try to beat the wall and break the wall or
180280	186920	Cattle pulled the wall, you know to be able to penetrate but a wall that will just won't break and a castle that just won't be
187640	190840	You know dominated is actually called his son Aziz a
191480	197680	Fort that is impossible to break through an impregnable fortress to strengthen and empower is Azza
197680	202800	This is used in the Quran like you know in surah Yasin. There were three messengers sent to one nation
203240	205440	Right if I've sent a lay him with name
205760	208880	Faka Zabahuma fa Azzaz na bethalifin
208880	214480	So same from the same word Aziz we sent them to messengers then we made them stronger with the third one
214480	222080	So to empower is actually the meaning of the Aziz and Azza is also used for when you are bullying someone
222560	226440	When you're being tough with someone from the same rugged tough
227160	230040	Overbearing it's used for example in the story of Dawood
230240	233080	Alayhi salam when he was praying in his quarters and
233800	240280	Two people just showed up in his private quarters, right and they said oh, this is my brother. He has 99 sheep
240280	243080	I only have one right and they said
243080	246000	Azzani fil hita use that word Azzani fil hita
246000	251760	He's really tough with me and he's intimidating and he's overpowering me and bullying me when he talks to me
251760	258320	So as I use when you're overpowering someone and Azza Adaihi is also used when you are afflicting or hurting someone
258320	261840	Okay, now this is just some of the background dictionary meanings of the word
261840	267040	Let's talk about how it's used for Allah in a second in the Quran. It's used 89 times for Allah
267400	270640	It's quite a bit is one of the most common names of Allah in the Quran
271160	276040	Ten other times it's used for other than Allah, so it's not only used for Allah
276040	280520	It's also used for other than Allah so for example in surah Yusuf
280520	284880	Musa Ali Yusuf alayhi salam ended up in the house of someone called what?
285520	291800	Al-Azeez Al-Azeez and when Yusuf alayhi salam came out of prison and he was made
292120	299600	Minister and his brothers came barely with any food and they were starving. They were broken. They said you had Aziz
300080	302080	So who did they call it Aziz?
302480	307800	Yusuf so Yusuf used to be the slave of an Aziz and eventually took his job and became an Aziz himself
308200	312040	So he was the minister and that's one of the words in Arabic for the minister
312040	319960	So similarly there are you know in the Quran Allah describes a person being thrown into hellfire that used to have a lot of power in Makkah
320480	326280	And he says look taste this hell in Naka and tell Aziz al-Kareem. You're the Aziz, right?
327240	329240	Please sir enjoy this
329640	335160	You know so this sarcastically they're being made to taste the punishment of hell because they used to use their power in the wrong way
335720	341560	Al-Azeez also so and and this is an observation we will get into when we finish this discussion
342400	345000	47 of these times so 89 times altogether
345800	350880	47 times Allah uses this word with al-Hakim al-Azeez al-Hakim or
351160	355520	Aziz al-Hakim or Aziz al-Hakima so two names of Allah paired together
355720	358040	You should know from my own studies
358040	363640	I'll share with you my own theory on what I find the most convincing approach to studying the names of Allah in the Quran
363840	367680	You know people say well, how why don't you do a series on the names of Allah? It's like if it was that easy?
367680	371160	I could I wish it was it's not that simple
371320	373720	So here's what just some things that you might
374240	379560	Benefit from that will help you in your own pondering and your own study in your own thinking about the names of Allah
380000	381840	Every name of Allah has a unique identity
382400	389320	So you should ponder al-malik by itself al-Qudus by itself al-Azeez by itself al-Hakim by itself
389320	391720	Every one of them has their own unique identity
392320	396260	But then what Allah does is sometimes he puts two of his names together
397400	404880	When he puts them together each one of them still has their own unique identity, but together they create a new meaning
405640	410640	They create a third meaning. So there's the meaning of a there's a meaning of B
410920	413840	But a and B together create the meaning of C
413840	416240	So there's a C meaning also that happens
416240	420960	We know like in chemistry you have one element and two element and they have a chemical reaction and now it's a compound
421200	426480	It's a different thing now. It's similar to that. So ghafur has its own qualities
426640	432840	Rahim has its own qualities, but ghafur and Rahim together also have a third quality a unique distinction
432840	435800	So al-Azeez al-Hakim comes together many many times
436160	441320	Which means al-Azeez has qualities al-Hakim has qualities and together they have a unique distinction
441320	444040	Which we will get to when we get towards the end. Okay now
445240	449560	Aziz I'll tell you some things about the word Aziz the two basic meanings
450040	455440	One is power and strength that cannot be overcome the unbeatable one
455880	462440	If someone is Aziz they are unbeatable. Okay, someone has Izzah. They are unbeatable. Okay
463160	465720	This word is used even like for example
466600	476960	By umar bin al-Khattab, radi Allahu ta'alaanhu wa-saz. Az-zan Allahu bil-Islam. We are a people. Allah made us unbeatable because of
477800	478920	Islam
478920	487720	Why is it that Izzah is from other than Allah and when we seek power from anyone other than him, Allah will make us weak
488280	494640	Allah will make us so Aziz there could mean power, but Izzah has another meaning and that's respect
495440	500800	Rank or respect when someone has more Izzah than you then they have a higher level of
501200	505300	Respect so now we've got two meanings unbeatable power and what?
506120	510080	Respect so we should understand why those two things are together in this word
511080	515480	Is it possible you respect someone but they don't have a lot of power? Yeah
516200	523120	You could have somebody who's a very wise, you know old man you have a lot of respect for him, but he has no power
524120	528340	I think that Yaqub al-Aziz Salam was very wise and respected
529080	531080	But he lived a life where he was mostly
531920	537560	Not empowered. He didn't have any Izzah in his family. He didn't have any control over his sons
537560	543640	Didn't isn't that the case so he has respect without power. Is it possible you have power without respect?
544520	548000	Yeah, all the time like how you feel about the police sometimes
548560	550120	They may have power
550120	554760	But you don't respect it or you don't like it or a judge may have power
554760	560000	But the people he's judging may not respect him may not like him or a president in the country may have power
560040	565320	But people don't respect him or her you understand so it's possible to have power without respect
565360	567360	It's also possible to have respect without
568000	572240	Power those little those two things can happen sometimes even if you don't have to think about government
572240	577780	You can think of a family it could be the head of a household the father in the household or the head of the household has a lot of power
578320	579840	but has no
579840	586440	Respect and sometimes he's a very respectable man, but nobody treats him right in the family. He has no power
586440	590720	So those two things can exist without each other. They're exclusive
591000	595160	but when you have someone who has the highest power and
595640	598800	At the same time gets the highest level of
599520	602000	Respect together that becomes a
602560	603760	Aziz
603760	608240	Aziz is when both of those things combine in one figure and that is Allah's name
608240	615040	Al-Aziz we Allah has the ultimate might the power and he's also the worthy of the highest level of respect
615320	618600	Okay, which is interesting because in Al-Aziz
619120	627080	You've got something from al-malik which is about power and there's something respectable which is in al-Quddus
627880	634400	Right, so it's actually taking elements from both and built building up on that in the word al-Aziz, okay
634880	637880	Now al-Aziz mankana yuridu al-Azza
637880	643440	Fadillahi al-Azza tu jami'a whoever wants is Allah says Allah owns all of it
643440	646280	You know what this means? This is a this is a concept in the Quran
646280	651520	That means anyone who ever has any power or anyone who ever has any respect in this world
652320	654320	They didn't get it themselves
654320	656040	That came from Allah
656040	662600	That came so my power over anything in my respect the respect that I have in a society the respect
662600	666640	I even have for myself wasn't generated by me. It was generated by Allah
666880	668880	Fadillahi al-Azza tu jami'a
668880	675280	Tu-Azzu man-tasha wa tu-dillu man-tasha you can humiliate who you can empower and honor whoever you want
675280	682760	You can humiliate and weaken whoever you want. What's Quran ad-Daud? I love this phrase. Dawud al-Aziz was one of the most powerful
683600	686800	Politically powered and empowered prophets in history
687080	691480	Right, he was a he was a massive ruler and he had great great empire under him
691520	696160	Okay, and Allah when he describes him he describes him as Allah's slave
697160	702480	So it's a story about how powerful Dawud is but his first introduction is he's Allah's what?
702920	707360	slave just to remind that actually his power is nothing because he's just a
707760	713000	Slave of Allah all power actually comes from Allah his is that came from Allah's door jump and so
713800	718440	Usually subjugation when somebody overpowers you somebody forces you to do something
718840	723200	Somebody tells you, you know, like for example if people are arresting a person, right?
723200	729160	They're making them put their hands behind their back and they're putting handcuffs on them. It's humiliating. Isn't it when someone overpowers you?
729160	735080	It's humiliating if two brothers are having an argument or a fight and one brother pins the other one down on the ground and says
735120	741280	Say sorry say sorry and I'll let you go. I'm never gonna say it say it say it and then he finally says sorry
741280	745880	Is that humiliating? Yep. Yep, and then when he finally left some books
745880	749280	I didn't mean it and then he runs away because he's trying to recover his dignity
750160	753800	All right, that never happened to me. I don't have brothers. I'm just saying okay
755080	763240	So as any film kid, he's humiliating me in other words when someone exacts there is on you then it is it is humiliating
763360	766640	You know sometimes you may have authority
767320	769320	But you don't use it
769440	773500	Right. I have an authority as a boss in my company
773500	776640	I have authority over my employees and if my employees mess up
777480	781560	They and they come to me and say hey, I'm I really messed up. I'm sorry. I have two choices
781560	785020	I could be as these right now and say oh, yeah
785560	787160	Well, you messed up
787160	792940	Let's go over it again, and I could humiliate the guy I could humiliate him or I could just say it's okay
792980	794900	Just you know don't worry about it. It happens
795860	801000	When I do that don't worry about it. It happens. I didn't exercise my right as what as
802020	806020	Aziz and I'll show you maybe I was being hakim at the time
807300	813460	You get what I'm saying because I could be Aziz right then and there but I decide you know what longer term
813460	816800	I would rather this person make that correction themselves and
817460	821580	Maybe me forgiving them this time will build more respect for me in their heart
821780	827740	And they will develop more loyalty instead of developing resentment. So maybe longer term. It's better for them
828420	832100	That I right now don't exercise my Izzah. I exercise my what?
832700	839180	Hey, so I I choose to step on the accelerator or release the accelerator depending on the next
839180	843580	You see how there's a good relationship between the two right by way by way of that example
843580	848980	Okay, so now let's talk a little bit more about the two names that are similar in these four names
849460	851460	Almalik and al-Qudus are similar
852140	855420	Why I'm like means King and a lazeez means authority
855900	859540	Right, so they both have to do with power control and authority. So then what's the difference?
859820	866340	What how would you understand the difference between them a really cool place to understand the difference between them is surat
866340	871740	Yousuf because surat Yousuf uses al-malik as one character and so it uses
871900	877740	So do some uses at Aziz as another character in the same story. So the king of Egypt is called al-malik
878740	880740	But the minister is called
881460	882620	al-Aziz
882620	888920	Now how many people here have businesses? If you have a business, I'm very few. Okay. Yeah, okay
889140	895860	If I was if I asked this question in America, most people would raise their hand. We're an entrepreneurial nation. Anyway, so
897180	902260	If you have it if somebody has a business they own the business they invested in the business
902260	905500	Let's just say I want to sometimes you have something called a passive investor
905620	907980	He says hey, I'm gonna give you my money
908500	914220	You buy this this building you find the tenants you run it you manage it. You're the manager. I'm the owner
915060	920820	Okay, so the one who owns it does he check every day? No, he just checks in six months
920820	923260	How's the financial report am I making money or not?
923260	927780	And every day if somebody didn't pay their rent or somebody has an electrical problem
927780	931140	Somebody has a gas problem. Somebody has this problem with that problem. Who's dealing with that?
932140	935660	Not the not the investor not the owner but the
936180	942380	The manager the manager is dealing with it, right? So the owner handed power over to the
943140	946060	Manager I'll think about government. There's the king and
946700	949780	The king says I want to collect taxes from every farmer
950340	952460	But the king is not going to go collect the taxes
952580	956940	The king is going to tell his military general the military general is going to tell his lieutenants
956940	960460	The lieutenants are going to tell their lieutenants being battalion commanders the�
960460	965020	The commanders are going to tell their individual soldiers each individual soldiers is going to go knock on the door
965460	969680	Is the king going and knocking on the door? No, so the king is actually
970940	972940	Powerful but by proxy
973420	976980	Not directly, but by pro it's indirect you understand
977540	983740	So a lot of times when you deal with authorities like the police the police was given the authority by the state
984620	986260	right
986260	990540	So the one the police stops me it's not actually because of that person's power
990580	994020	It's the power that was granted to him by proxy from the mulk
994620	1000380	From the governance you understand so the medic the king the term is actually about power
1000620	1006500	That is the top command is issued by the medic, but then it is executed by people in the lower ranks
1006940	1008660	Now let's go to the lowest rank
1008660	1012940	Let's go to let's say one police officer or one soldier the king made the order
1012940	1017900	I want to collect taxes and then there's you know, he's a there's bcd
1018420	1022260	Ffgh and all the way down to to x is the soldier
1022700	1027660	At the bottom of that chain of command all the way almost at the bottom when he goes to collect taxes
1027660	1029660	He beats the guy up or
1030020	1033740	He takes a little bit less than he should take or he takes more than he should take
1034700	1037860	Why because in that moment who has all the authority?
1039460	1042820	The soldier does he's actually as easy in that situation
1043820	1046900	There's the money cup there and there's the Aziz
1047660	1050100	Down here the Aziz is the one who actually
1050860	1052860	exercises his power and
1052900	1056380	Exercises is a thord and these are usually two separate things
1057180	1061940	You have people that run for the presidency or the prime ministership in different countries
1061940	1065220	They have elections. They say I will execute this policy this policy this policy
1065500	1071340	They win the power and then they're not able to implement their own policies because they may have more
1071620	1074300	But they don't seem to have what is that?
1074580	1078060	They're not able to execute because the people under them are not listening to them
1078060	1084780	Or they're not following what they they say they should do be doing you understand what a business is not succeeding and the owner says
1084780	1090860	I need new management because I have the milk, but I don't have the what I don't have the is that I need new
1090860	1094940	Manage because they're gonna do better is that job for me you understand so
1095460	1097900	Allah takes both milk and
1098020	1100300	Azza
1100300	1107020	He's a medic and he's a dazziz you see why that's powerful because now not a leaf moves
1107780	1109780	Without Allah's power and authority
1110500	1115940	No one gets humiliated and or honored except by Allah's command, you know
1116500	1119060	Teachers I agree one last example teachers
1119060	1125140	There's a policy in the school that if you fail your exam you will no longer be graduating, right?
1125740	1132380	But that's the policy on top and the principal has hired the department heads the headmasters for each department and then the
1132420	1139340	Departments have hired the teachers and the teacher is the one who actually has authority over the student and the student failed the exam by two points
1140740	1144620	According to the milk of the school this student should be
1145340	1150420	Expelled or they cannot move to the next grade, but the teacher says hey just do this extra assignment
1150420	1152860	I'll give you an extra two points. I'll let you pass
1153500	1155500	Because in the end who had the Aiza
1156300	1157940	And teacher did
1157940	1163740	Sometimes you have people at the at the restaurant. Can I have some ketchup? We don't allow that here. We don't give extra ketchup
1165140	1166340	Really
1166340	1171740	Read the sign. I saw you give it to your cousin that was about right before you give him four extra ketchups
1171740	1175820	You can't give me a ketchup. I know you have the Aiza and you're acting like you're working under the milk
1177780	1179780	The strangest of Seer of Quran
1183220	1190740	But you understand the difference between these two and how Allah is the highest authority and the most intimate immediate authority also
1191060	1195180	Between both of these names. Why was it important for Yusuf to take over?
1196060	1198820	The Aziz role when the king is already there
1199460	1207100	Because the king does not know how to execute all of these the crisis the economic crisis who has the capability of doing that
1207820	1211100	Yusuf alaihi salam so even though there was a Malik Aziz was needed
1211100	1214900	This is the concept of kingdom and authority that sometimes gets separated
1214900	1221300	But Allah doesn't allow for them to be separated and he says he's Malik and he's also an Aziz both both combined together
1221420	1228820	Okay, so now throughout human history someone's seizing power or taking the throne needs to settle into the throne
1229300	1236180	Stabilize the kingdom establishes authority one might become a Malik but and be considered good
1236180	1241940	Doos but still not become a Aziz. That's another point. You know when people become newly appointed
1242340	1244860	Then their government is stable or unstable still
1245820	1249980	Unstable they say well, let's see how the first hundred days go or if it's a new king
1249980	1253780	Let's see if he gets assassinated in the first week. Let's see if his brother kills him
1254220	1256380	Let's see if his uncle kills him, you know
1256860	1262660	Back at the day sometimes they would be in the Chinese emperors amongst among them for example a four-year-old would become the ruler
1262660	1265780	He's just sitting there in his diapers. He's ruling China. You know
1266180	1271580	They're like, I don't know who's gonna come and kill him. So he's got milk, but his authority is not settled
1271580	1277340	It's not actually he's not invincible. He's not someone who cannot be overpowered. So it's shaky
1277380	1283100	So he's got milk, but he doesn't have is that lies and Malik and an Aziz at the same time. Okay, so
1283740	1284820	now
1284820	1287860	Let's talk about the Aziz and al-Hakim actually
1287860	1292020	Let me tell you a little bit about a Hakim and then we'll talk about that and then I'll give you your first break
1292860	1294180	so
1294220	1299380	Hikku or Hakama, this is actually the first was Hakama to insaamullah inna Hakama means the chin
1299980	1306060	There's a weird concept in Arabic the chin or this jawbone is called Hakama for human beings
1306060	1310060	It's also called that for for sheep and the idea is it holds your face together
1311100	1313100	It holds your face in place
1313140	1315140	Is it this isn't there?
1315500	1317500	You know so
1317500	1319500	Manaha min atta fakuk wa atta sayu
1319860	1325700	Sawa when cannot madia or ma'noia or kalaman meaning something that prevents something else from falling apart
1325700	1327940	The idea is the chin is keeping your face from
1328500	1333980	Falling apart. Okay, it's also a calm was also used for when they put the saddle on a horse
1333980	1339060	Sometimes they put a thing on a horse's chin and then you pull on it you pull on its neck, right?
1339060	1343100	That's actually an a cam also when a building is well structured
1343100	1348500	So it won't fall apart the foundations are strong the pillars are strong. They say oh, Kima till be now
1348740	1351820	Oh, Kima till be now and from it came the word hookum
1351820	1357100	Which you might be familiar with hookum means a verdict or a decision and a hakim is a ruler, right?
1357100	1362700	But a ruler who makes firm decisions well thought out decisions from this
1362700	1365980	We also get the idea of Hikma anyone know what Hikma means
1366940	1372700	Wisdom the concept of wisdom in Arabic is really interesting. It is actually based on the idea that you've
1373340	1375340	considered all of the factors and
1375900	1381060	After considering all of the factors you have an opinion. That's a very firmly rooted
1381740	1385460	So that this decision you're making or this idea you have won't fall apart
1386340	1391700	You know, it's not whimsical. It's not flimsy. It's very well thought out. It's it's secure
1392180	1396340	Like the chin holding the face secure right or the building being well built
1396860	1401180	Ideas that are well built well tested. They don't fall apart
1401540	1405260	They though the sum of those ideas become Hikman they become wisdom
1405460	1407460	Okay, so he says
1410460	1411960	The best of knowledge
1411960	1417340	Based on the best of knowledge and the best of know how you understand how to take the best course of action
1417580	1419580	That would be Hikma
1419980	1426020	Hikma is also used in Arabic for wise sayings. I gotta learn some German wise sayings before I go
1426220	1431700	Everywhere I go, I gotta I have to learn some wise sayings like I learned one wise saying in in Malaysia
1431700	1435180	I'm gonna butcher it. They say do it first say sorry later
1440780	1447140	Because if you ask permission first, what are they gonna say no, so just do it and then say sorry
1449060	1453700	Very wise, yeah, it really works. Okay, don't try this at all
1456540	1459660	Especially not a Islam like do it first and then yes, sorry Allah
1460660	1462660	I'm Malaysian wisdom
1465860	1467340	Anyway, so
1467340	1469340	the idea of wisdom in
1470100	1473820	Islamic literature Hikma is actually a really strong idea tomorrow
1473820	1477740	I'm probably gonna have a special 30-minute session with you guys just on wisdom because
1478500	1480500	this is a huge concept and
1481020	1485460	We have very a variety of ideas of what wisdom means, right?
1485460	1490020	And we I want to get get develop a Quran inspired concept of what it means to have wisdom
1490020	1494780	So this is Allah's name and Hakim which basically comes down to two things the decision maker
1495300	1498020	But the decision maker who makes decisions based on wisdom
1498820	1503700	Okay, so he has hukum which means he has the power to make decisions, but he makes them based on
1504340	1506860	Wisdom and wisdom means you considered all the factors
1507700	1509340	Right a
1509340	1514300	Hakim is different from a qadi a qadi just makes a judgment a hakim says oh you have a cake
1514300	1516220	You have a situation you want me to solve it?
1516220	1522020	Let me find out all the other witnesses all the other situations because if I make this decision who else will this impact?
1522340	1523820	What will be the trickle effect?
1523820	1530260	You know like the butterfly effect thing what will be the domino effect of this decision if I considered everything that I made a
1530260	1534300	Decision that would be a hakim because he used proper Hikma. Okay?
1534860	1538820	Now and Aziz al-Hakim are paired together 47 times in the Quran
1538820	1540820	So we should learn something about that if
1541100	1546540	Let's think about a human being before we think about Allah if a human being has complete authority you could do whatever you want
1547180	1549780	You could do whatever you want you have complete power
1551140	1556380	Authority that is unquestioned can often be associated with unwise rash and
1557220	1561280	Unilateral decisions. I'm gonna do whatever I want because I'm the king I
1562220	1568940	Well, I said I want this I said kill that person. I said let this one go. I you know and you just become a
1569940	1575180	Like a tantrum child you could just do whatever you want because you have no controls over you
1575180	1581740	That's why rulers of the past had wise counsel and even now presidents have a cabinet
1582260	1589300	Right an advisor strategic advisors. So the president. Ah, man, these you know, like in like in sitting in America
1589300	1596280	Some president these Russians they're annoying me. Let's bomb them and then I'm just in the mood to bomb while he's eating his french fries
1596760	1604320	Right then the strategic at sir actually it will cause this following chain respect and this is gonna affect the economy in this way and politics in this way and this
1606320	1611160	Can't bomb anyone it's been so long I spent like three months. I didn't bomb anyone like
1612900	1619240	In other words if you just have absolute authority then it will create disaster and
1619880	1625560	In the human realm in the human realm and so human beings since the beginning whenever you have authority
1625560	1627560	They have to have some kind of what?
1627920	1633220	Counsel some kind of wise counsel and if you don't have that they have for example in the American constitutional system
1633220	1637840	They have something called checks and balances. They didn't want to give the president all the authority
1637840	1644000	The government was divided into the executive branch the legislative branch the judicial branch three different branches
1644000	1646880	Why because if you give all the authority to the president
1647080	1650480	Then that's going to turn into a dictatorship and it's going to be unwise
1651120	1657360	Right, so you have to break up the authority the is that is actually broken up and they thought this will be the wiser approach
1657360	1662440	It can also be associated with whimsical decisions that sway from one direction to another
1663200	1666200	spontaneously in other words one day the king says
1666800	1671920	Get out of here. I never want to see you again. The next day. He says hey, where's that guy? I miss him. I like his jokes
1672160	1675040	The king can change his mood
1675600	1681840	Split second and the whole law changes in the country if you're living in a dictatorship your entire nation depends on the king's mood
1682760	1688680	Because he's running a dictatorship and this is not just about kings and large authorities. Sometimes you have dictators in a family
1689360	1694400	Sometimes you have dictators in a company. You already the company's one day. We're going this way one day. We're going that way
1694880	1696880	One day you're fired one day. You're hired
1696960	1700720	You know you never know based on their mood
1700880	1704160	So what is missing when people tend to have authority?
1704560	1706560	Wisdom seems to be missing
1706560	1710200	Take back step back. Consider all the factors before you make a decision
1711080	1714760	Know what you're getting what are the ramifications? What are the consequences?
1714760	1720320	Are you going to be taking this decision back tomorrow? Is this just emotion or is this actually well thought out?
1720560	1724640	meaning in in in the world in life when we think of is
1724880	1726160	Is that
1726160	1729600	Many times the more is that someone has the less Hikmah they have
1730400	1735480	The less Hikmah they have Allah Azza which has described himself perfectly a lot of Aziz
1735760	1738880	But at the and separately as a hakeem, but now they're together
1739680	1742960	He's the only Aziz. That's truly also what?
1743600	1745000	And hakeem
1745000	1749320	This is his authority always executed with the highest levels of wisdom and
1749800	1752480	Even above all of that Allah says about himself
1752480	1756520	So those those two names have something to do with each other
1756520	1761160	But we there's two other names we didn't compare to each other which are al-Quddus and al-Hakeem
1761720	1763720	al-Quddus is
1763960	1771480	The sanctified one and it's connected with heavenly matters. I've talked about before right so the spiritual matters the matters of goodness
1772240	1777480	And morality they are they exist in reclusion meaning they don't deal with worldly things
1777720	1782200	I don't want to know about the market. I don't know what I don't want about the social situation or the political situation
1782360	1788840	I just want to know about what's happening what's right and wrong in the heavenly sense in the spiritual sense the wise council
1789160	1792120	By the way kings in the past they had two kinds of advisors
1792440	1795800	They had the spiritual advisor and they had the strategic advisors
1796600	1802920	Okay, so the the king would go to the pope or the church or whatever for blessings and prayers and what should I do?
1803480	1807400	And they would go to their military advisors and their economic advisors for what should I do?
1807720	1811560	And were they always on the same page these two advisors? No, they hate each other
1812120	1814040	Like why is he listening to him? Why is he listening to him?
1814360	1819480	I remember when the first time a catholic became president in the united states and jonah f canady became president
1819800	1826440	There was a whole issue in the us about well, he's catholic. So is he loyal to the constitution or is he loyal to the pope?
1827400	1832040	And if he goes and has a conversation with the pope and the pope tells him issue this policy go against this policy
1832280	1834680	Is he going to follow that or that? Where's his loyalty big?
1834760	1839240	You know, is he going to follow his council coming from the muqaddas side?
1839480	1843240	Or is he going to follow his actual cabinet the hikmah side two different sides?
1844040	1850360	And so in a sense the muqaddas class concerns itself with the inwardly and the wise council with the outwardly
1850680	1856600	Allah needs no council. Allah needs no ex inwardly. He's himself al-quddus and he is himself
1857320	1859560	Al-hakim no other king can be this
1860520	1862520	No other king can be like this
1862520	1865400	So this in this way now now you'll understand this point
1865880	1868920	Kings had two kinds of council in the past spiritual and strategic
1869240	1875240	Many times the two were at odds with each other a lot in these names establishes the most complete description of kingdom
1875480	1880440	His kingdom encompasses righteous holiness direct authority with invincible power
1880920	1884040	Wisdom and secure governance taking all factors into account
1884280	1890200	Meaning this is the most perfect kind of kingdom and on top of that then Allah then you understand what Allah says when he says
1891000	1893000	Fa'alul limayuri he does whatever he wants
1893640	1897880	Now when he says you he does whatever he wants. It's not like when a human being does whatever they want
1898600	1901000	This is a higher level of whatever he wants
1901400	1904120	And so now you come back to this behan bi end this session
1904520	1908520	This description covers every flaw that all kingdoms otherwise have
1909080	1911080	You can have a kingdom that doesn't have the authority
1911720	1915800	You can have a kingdom that isn't righteous. You can have a kingdom that doesn't have the wise council
1916520	1918520	You can have things missing
1918520	1921240	But the focus on wamaa fel ard
1921800	1924680	In yusab bi hurlillahimafi as-samawatu wa-awafil ard
1925000	1931560	Is qunaya that it is time that people of the world recognize this truth and were introduced to Allah's perfect kingdom
1932120	1939080	They need to recognize who Allah is they'll recognize what the perfect kingdom of Allah looks like there must be some perfect way
1939400	1943080	To introduce them to this king so they too become people of what?
1943880	1946040	To speak if the kingdom is perfect
1946600	1949240	Then that king deserves to be considered perfect
1949560	1954040	And if you consider someone perfect, what do you do of them? You do to speak of them
1954120	1956120	Now you understand the logic of the ayah
1956280	1959320	You subbi hurlillahimafi as-samawatu wa-awafil ard
1959640	1962200	Al-malik al-quddus al-aziz al-hakib
1962760	1967560	As we get to the end of this ayah now we will see now that Allah has described himself as the perfect king
1967960	1973560	And everybody does this be all the rest of creation know this it seems the only ones who don't really know this are
1974120	1978280	Human beings there must be a way for human beings to get to know this king
1978760	1982600	And how perfect he is and that's what the subject matter of the second ayah is going to be
1982680	1985960	I'll give you guys your first break baraka allah wa-awakum as-samawalikum wa-awafil al-hamdullahi wa-awakum
1987560	1991960	Here's what's coming up in the next episode and this deeper look of surah al-jumu'ah
1992200	1998360	So when you develop that love of of Quran of contemplation of study then the way you're going to start talking about it
1998920	2001960	You're not you're not going to have to take some course on public speaking
2002600	2009640	Or how do I you know you're not your aim is not to become a public speaker or an influencer most influencers are influenced
2009960	2011960	or under the influence
2014600	2017720	But the the idea is that you want to become a public figure
2017720	2022120	The idea is you should be able to speak passionately about something that inspires you
