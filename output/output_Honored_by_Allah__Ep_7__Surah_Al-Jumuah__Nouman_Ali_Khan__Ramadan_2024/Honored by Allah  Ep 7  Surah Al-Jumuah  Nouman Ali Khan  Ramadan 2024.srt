1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Sometimes you have people at the at the restaurant can I have some ketchup? We don't allow that here. We don't give extra ketchup

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,640
Really

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,040
Read the sign. I saw you give it to your cousin. It was about right before you give him four extra ketchups

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,140
You can't give me a ketchup. I know you have the Aiza and you're acting like you're working under the milk

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,080
The strangest of seed of Quran

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,680
Now

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,440
Let's move on to al-Azeez you got work to do so

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,400
Al-Azeez is one of the most common names of Allah. It comes from

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,080
Earth actually

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,440
Azaza Azaza ma'zuza. This is all used for tough ground

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,600
Like you know earth you can dig in too easily. That's not arda Aziz or Azaz or Azza

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:57,480
But earth that's made of rock and you can't break through, you know tough earth. That's actually called Azaz unbreakable soil

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,120
Unbreakable land like rocky land. That's called arda ma'zuza

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,760
Farasul mu'tazza was used in mu'tazza as the attribute here for a horse that has very strong muscles

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,320
Like it's rock solid. It's built like that. That's called mu'tazza

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,800
And then sometimes they had a camel that had a disease where its muscles become stiff like muscle atrophy

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,480
Right and when it became so stiff you couldn't milk the camel

18
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,280
You couldn't get the milk because its muscles are all tightened up and that was actually called naqatun azuz

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Because it became so tough. So the common theme you're learning is rocks that are tough muscles that are tough muscles that have become stiff

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,320
The eqatun ahali. This is mistycle mistycle. Ahali min shiddati nasiji tahmiha

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,800
It's because because of the tightness or the atrophy of the muscles. You cannot get milk out of the camel

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,440
Okay, al-Azeez also means the elevation of rank

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so if you went from

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Internship to manager to executive manager to director you are increasing in is

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,120
You're increasing in your rank in your company an invincible person

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,960
Let me explain what invisible here means nobody can take you down

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,720
Nobody can attack you. Nobody can challenge your position if you're in an untouchable position

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Then you are called al-Azeez

29
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,800
Al-Azeez one one punch man in his cartoon show is

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,820
Aziz, okay, so if you want to buy analogy if you'd like to you know, so Superman without kryptonite

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,680
Is Aziz until Kryptonite shows up or the Hulk or so?

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,040
I don't know what but these are examples of somebody who's invincible can't be broken can't be defeated, right?

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,120
And that's called al-Azeez al-qawee al-shadeed al-ghaalab al-ladila yuhaalab

34
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,200
There's the strong one that wins every time and cannot be won over

35
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,160
Maa la yumkin this type of my mother you can't will soon we're a he met the house and Aziz

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,920
It's also used for something that is impossible to

37
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,680
Beat like they use it for a castle or a fort, you know castles used to have these walls outside

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,960
Right so that armies can't just walk in they have to try to beat the wall and break the wall or

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,920
Cattle pulled the wall, you know to be able to penetrate but a wall that will just won't break and a castle that just won't be

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,840
You know dominated is actually called his son Aziz a

41
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,680
Fort that is impossible to break through an impregnable fortress to strengthen and empower is Azza

42
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,800
This is used in the Quran like you know in surah Yasin. There were three messengers sent to one nation

43
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,440
Right if I've sent a lay him with name

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,880
Faka Zabahuma fa Azzaz na bethalifin

45
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,480
So same from the same word Aziz we sent them to messengers then we made them stronger with the third one

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:42,080
So to empower is actually the meaning of the Aziz and Azza is also used for when you are bullying someone

47
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,440
When you're being tough with someone from the same rugged tough

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,040
Overbearing it's used for example in the story of Dawood

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,080
Alayhi salam when he was praying in his quarters and

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,280
Two people just showed up in his private quarters, right and they said oh, this is my brother. He has 99 sheep

51
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,080
I only have one right and they said

52
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,000
Azzani fil hita use that word Azzani fil hita

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,760
He's really tough with me and he's intimidating and he's overpowering me and bullying me when he talks to me

54
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,320
So as I use when you're overpowering someone and Azza Adaihi is also used when you are afflicting or hurting someone

55
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,840
Okay, now this is just some of the background dictionary meanings of the word

56
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,040
Let's talk about how it's used for Allah in a second in the Quran. It's used 89 times for Allah

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,640
It's quite a bit is one of the most common names of Allah in the Quran

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Ten other times it's used for other than Allah, so it's not only used for Allah

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,520
It's also used for other than Allah so for example in surah Yusuf

60
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,880
Musa Ali Yusuf alayhi salam ended up in the house of someone called what?

61
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,800
Al-Azeez Al-Azeez and when Yusuf alayhi salam came out of prison and he was made

62
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:59,600
Minister and his brothers came barely with any food and they were starving. They were broken. They said you had Aziz

63
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
So who did they call it Aziz?

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,800
Yusuf so Yusuf used to be the slave of an Aziz and eventually took his job and became an Aziz himself

65
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,040
So he was the minister and that's one of the words in Arabic for the minister

66
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:19,960
So similarly there are you know in the Quran Allah describes a person being thrown into hellfire that used to have a lot of power in Makkah

67
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,280
And he says look taste this hell in Naka and tell Aziz al-Kareem. You're the Aziz, right?

68
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Please sir enjoy this

69
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,160
You know so this sarcastically they're being made to taste the punishment of hell because they used to use their power in the wrong way

70
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,560
Al-Azeez also so and and this is an observation we will get into when we finish this discussion

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,000
47 of these times so 89 times altogether

72
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,880
47 times Allah uses this word with al-Hakim al-Azeez al-Hakim or

73
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,520
Aziz al-Hakim or Aziz al-Hakima so two names of Allah paired together

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,040
You should know from my own studies

75
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,640
I'll share with you my own theory on what I find the most convincing approach to studying the names of Allah in the Quran

76
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,680
You know people say well, how why don't you do a series on the names of Allah? It's like if it was that easy?

77
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,160
I could I wish it was it's not that simple

78
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,720
So here's what just some things that you might

79
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,560
Benefit from that will help you in your own pondering and your own study in your own thinking about the names of Allah

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,840
Every name of Allah has a unique identity

81
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,320
So you should ponder al-malik by itself al-Qudus by itself al-Azeez by itself al-Hakim by itself

82
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,720
Every one of them has their own unique identity

83
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,260
But then what Allah does is sometimes he puts two of his names together

84
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:44,880
When he puts them together each one of them still has their own unique identity, but together they create a new meaning

85
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,640
They create a third meaning. So there's the meaning of a there's a meaning of B

86
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,840
But a and B together create the meaning of C

87
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,240
So there's a C meaning also that happens

88
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,960
We know like in chemistry you have one element and two element and they have a chemical reaction and now it's a compound

89
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,480
It's a different thing now. It's similar to that. So ghafur has its own qualities

90
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,840
Rahim has its own qualities, but ghafur and Rahim together also have a third quality a unique distinction

91
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,800
So al-Azeez al-Hakim comes together many many times

92
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,320
Which means al-Azeez has qualities al-Hakim has qualities and together they have a unique distinction

93
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,040
Which we will get to when we get towards the end. Okay now

94
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,560
Aziz I'll tell you some things about the word Aziz the two basic meanings

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,440
One is power and strength that cannot be overcome the unbeatable one

96
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:42,440
If someone is Aziz they are unbeatable. Okay, someone has Izzah. They are unbeatable. Okay

97
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,720
This word is used even like for example

98
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:56,960
By umar bin al-Khattab, radi Allahu ta'alaanhu wa-saz. Az-zan Allahu bil-Islam. We are a people. Allah made us unbeatable because of

99
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,920
Islam

100
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:07,720
Why is it that Izzah is from other than Allah and when we seek power from anyone other than him, Allah will make us weak

101
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,640
Allah will make us so Aziz there could mean power, but Izzah has another meaning and that's respect

102
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,800
Rank or respect when someone has more Izzah than you then they have a higher level of

103
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,300
Respect so now we've got two meanings unbeatable power and what?

104
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,080
Respect so we should understand why those two things are together in this word

105
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,480
Is it possible you respect someone but they don't have a lot of power? Yeah

106
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:43,120
You could have somebody who's a very wise, you know old man you have a lot of respect for him, but he has no power

107
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,340
I think that Yaqub al-Aziz Salam was very wise and respected

108
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
But he lived a life where he was mostly

109
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,560
Not empowered. He didn't have any Izzah in his family. He didn't have any control over his sons

110
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,640
Didn't isn't that the case so he has respect without power. Is it possible you have power without respect?

111
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, all the time like how you feel about the police sometimes

112
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,120
They may have power

113
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,760
But you don't respect it or you don't like it or a judge may have power

114
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,000
But the people he's judging may not respect him may not like him or a president in the country may have power

115
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,320
But people don't respect him or her you understand so it's possible to have power without respect

116
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
It's also possible to have respect without

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,240
Power those little those two things can happen sometimes even if you don't have to think about government

118
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,780
You can think of a family it could be the head of a household the father in the household or the head of the household has a lot of power

119
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,840
but has no

120
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,440
Respect and sometimes he's a very respectable man, but nobody treats him right in the family. He has no power

121
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,720
So those two things can exist without each other. They're exclusive

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,160
but when you have someone who has the highest power and

123
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,800
At the same time gets the highest level of

124
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,000
Respect together that becomes a

125
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,760
Aziz

126
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,240
Aziz is when both of those things combine in one figure and that is Allah's name

127
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,040
Al-Aziz we Allah has the ultimate might the power and he's also the worthy of the highest level of respect

128
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,600
Okay, which is interesting because in Al-Aziz

129
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:27,080
You've got something from al-malik which is about power and there's something respectable which is in al-Quddus

130
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:34,400
Right, so it's actually taking elements from both and built building up on that in the word al-Aziz, okay

131
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Now al-Aziz mankana yuridu al-Azza

132
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,440
Fadillahi al-Azza tu jami'a whoever wants is Allah says Allah owns all of it

133
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,280
You know what this means? This is a this is a concept in the Quran

134
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,520
That means anyone who ever has any power or anyone who ever has any respect in this world

135
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
They didn't get it themselves

136
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,040
That came from Allah

137
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,600
That came so my power over anything in my respect the respect that I have in a society the respect

138
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,640
I even have for myself wasn't generated by me. It was generated by Allah

139
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Fadillahi al-Azza tu jami'a

140
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,280
Tu-Azzu man-tasha wa tu-dillu man-tasha you can humiliate who you can empower and honor whoever you want

141
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,760
You can humiliate and weaken whoever you want. What's Quran ad-Daud? I love this phrase. Dawud al-Aziz was one of the most powerful

142
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,800
Politically powered and empowered prophets in history

143
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Right, he was a he was a massive ruler and he had great great empire under him

144
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,160
Okay, and Allah when he describes him he describes him as Allah's slave

145
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,480
So it's a story about how powerful Dawud is but his first introduction is he's Allah's what?

146
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,360
slave just to remind that actually his power is nothing because he's just a

147
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,000
Slave of Allah all power actually comes from Allah his is that came from Allah's door jump and so

148
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,440
Usually subjugation when somebody overpowers you somebody forces you to do something

149
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,200
Somebody tells you, you know, like for example if people are arresting a person, right?

150
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,160
They're making them put their hands behind their back and they're putting handcuffs on them. It's humiliating. Isn't it when someone overpowers you?

151
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,080
It's humiliating if two brothers are having an argument or a fight and one brother pins the other one down on the ground and says

152
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,280
Say sorry say sorry and I'll let you go. I'm never gonna say it say it say it and then he finally says sorry

153
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,880
Is that humiliating? Yep. Yep, and then when he finally left some books

154
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,280
I didn't mean it and then he runs away because he's trying to recover his dignity

155
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,800
All right, that never happened to me. I don't have brothers. I'm just saying okay

156
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:43,240
So as any film kid, he's humiliating me in other words when someone exacts there is on you then it is it is humiliating

157
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,640
You know sometimes you may have authority

158
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
But you don't use it

159
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,500
Right. I have an authority as a boss in my company

160
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,640
I have authority over my employees and if my employees mess up

161
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,560
They and they come to me and say hey, I'm I really messed up. I'm sorry. I have two choices

162
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,020
I could be as these right now and say oh, yeah

163
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,160
Well, you messed up

164
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,940
Let's go over it again, and I could humiliate the guy I could humiliate him or I could just say it's okay

165
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,900
Just you know don't worry about it. It happens

166
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,000
When I do that don't worry about it. It happens. I didn't exercise my right as what as

167
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,020
Aziz and I'll show you maybe I was being hakim at the time

168
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:33,460
You get what I'm saying because I could be Aziz right then and there but I decide you know what longer term

169
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,800
I would rather this person make that correction themselves and

170
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,580
Maybe me forgiving them this time will build more respect for me in their heart

171
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,740
And they will develop more loyalty instead of developing resentment. So maybe longer term. It's better for them

172
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,100
That I right now don't exercise my Izzah. I exercise my what?

173
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:59,180
Hey, so I I choose to step on the accelerator or release the accelerator depending on the next

174
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,580
You see how there's a good relationship between the two right by way by way of that example

175
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,980
Okay, so now let's talk a little bit more about the two names that are similar in these four names

176
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,460
Almalik and al-Qudus are similar

177
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,420
Why I'm like means King and a lazeez means authority

178
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,540
Right, so they both have to do with power control and authority. So then what's the difference?

179
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:26,340
What how would you understand the difference between them a really cool place to understand the difference between them is surat

180
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,740
Yousuf because surat Yousuf uses al-malik as one character and so it uses

181
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:37,740
So do some uses at Aziz as another character in the same story. So the king of Egypt is called al-malik

182
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
But the minister is called

183
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,620
al-Aziz

184
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:48,920
Now how many people here have businesses? If you have a business, I'm very few. Okay. Yeah, okay

185
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:55,860
If I was if I asked this question in America, most people would raise their hand. We're an entrepreneurial nation. Anyway, so

186
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,260
If you have it if somebody has a business they own the business they invested in the business

187
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,500
Let's just say I want to sometimes you have something called a passive investor

188
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,980
He says hey, I'm gonna give you my money

189
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,220
You buy this this building you find the tenants you run it you manage it. You're the manager. I'm the owner

190
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,820
Okay, so the one who owns it does he check every day? No, he just checks in six months

191
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,260
How's the financial report am I making money or not?

192
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,780
And every day if somebody didn't pay their rent or somebody has an electrical problem

193
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,140
Somebody has a gas problem. Somebody has this problem with that problem. Who's dealing with that?

194
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,660
Not the not the investor not the owner but the

195
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:42,380
The manager the manager is dealing with it, right? So the owner handed power over to the

196
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,060
Manager I'll think about government. There's the king and

197
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,780
The king says I want to collect taxes from every farmer

198
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,460
But the king is not going to go collect the taxes

199
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,940
The king is going to tell his military general the military general is going to tell his lieutenants

200
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,460
The lieutenants are going to tell their lieutenants being battalion commanders the�

201
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,020
The commanders are going to tell their individual soldiers each individual soldiers is going to go knock on the door

202
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,680
Is the king going and knocking on the door? No, so the king is actually

203
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
Powerful but by proxy

204
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,980
Not directly, but by pro it's indirect you understand

205
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,740
So a lot of times when you deal with authorities like the police the police was given the authority by the state

206
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,260
right

207
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,540
So the one the police stops me it's not actually because of that person's power

208
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,020
It's the power that was granted to him by proxy from the mulk

209
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,380
From the governance you understand so the medic the king the term is actually about power

210
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,500
That is the top command is issued by the medic, but then it is executed by people in the lower ranks

211
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,660
Now let's go to the lowest rank

212
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,940
Let's go to let's say one police officer or one soldier the king made the order

213
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,900
I want to collect taxes and then there's you know, he's a there's bcd

214
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,260
Ffgh and all the way down to to x is the soldier

215
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,660
At the bottom of that chain of command all the way almost at the bottom when he goes to collect taxes

216
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,660
He beats the guy up or

217
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,740
He takes a little bit less than he should take or he takes more than he should take

218
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,860
Why because in that moment who has all the authority?

219
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,820
The soldier does he's actually as easy in that situation

220
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,900
There's the money cup there and there's the Aziz

221
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,100
Down here the Aziz is the one who actually

222
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,860
exercises his power and

223
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,380
Exercises is a thord and these are usually two separate things

224
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,940
You have people that run for the presidency or the prime ministership in different countries

225
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,220
They have elections. They say I will execute this policy this policy this policy

226
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,340
They win the power and then they're not able to implement their own policies because they may have more

227
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,300
But they don't seem to have what is that?

228
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,060
They're not able to execute because the people under them are not listening to them

229
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:04,780
Or they're not following what they they say they should do be doing you understand what a business is not succeeding and the owner says

230
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,860
I need new management because I have the milk, but I don't have the what I don't have the is that I need new

231
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,940
Manage because they're gonna do better is that job for me you understand so

232
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,900
Allah takes both milk and

233
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,300
Azza

234
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:27,020
He's a medic and he's a dazziz you see why that's powerful because now not a leaf moves

235
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,780
Without Allah's power and authority

236
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,940
No one gets humiliated and or honored except by Allah's command, you know

237
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,060
Teachers I agree one last example teachers

238
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:45,140
There's a policy in the school that if you fail your exam you will no longer be graduating, right?

239
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:52,380
But that's the policy on top and the principal has hired the department heads the headmasters for each department and then the

240
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:59,340
Departments have hired the teachers and the teacher is the one who actually has authority over the student and the student failed the exam by two points

241
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,620
According to the milk of the school this student should be

242
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,420
Expelled or they cannot move to the next grade, but the teacher says hey just do this extra assignment

243
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,860
I'll give you an extra two points. I'll let you pass

244
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Because in the end who had the Aiza

245
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,940
And teacher did

246
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,740
Sometimes you have people at the at the restaurant. Can I have some ketchup? We don't allow that here. We don't give extra ketchup

247
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,340
Really

248
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,740
Read the sign. I saw you give it to your cousin that was about right before you give him four extra ketchups

249
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,820
You can't give me a ketchup. I know you have the Aiza and you're acting like you're working under the milk

250
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,780
The strangest of Seer of Quran

251
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:50,740
But you understand the difference between these two and how Allah is the highest authority and the most intimate immediate authority also

252
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,180
Between both of these names. Why was it important for Yusuf to take over?

253
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,820
The Aziz role when the king is already there

254
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:07,100
Because the king does not know how to execute all of these the crisis the economic crisis who has the capability of doing that

255
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,100
Yusuf alaihi salam so even though there was a Malik Aziz was needed

256
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,900
This is the concept of kingdom and authority that sometimes gets separated

257
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:21,300
But Allah doesn't allow for them to be separated and he says he's Malik and he's also an Aziz both both combined together

258
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:28,820
Okay, so now throughout human history someone's seizing power or taking the throne needs to settle into the throne

259
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:36,180
Stabilize the kingdom establishes authority one might become a Malik but and be considered good

260
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:41,940
Doos but still not become a Aziz. That's another point. You know when people become newly appointed

261
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,860
Then their government is stable or unstable still

262
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,980
Unstable they say well, let's see how the first hundred days go or if it's a new king

263
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,780
Let's see if he gets assassinated in the first week. Let's see if his brother kills him

264
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,380
Let's see if his uncle kills him, you know

265
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,660
Back at the day sometimes they would be in the Chinese emperors amongst among them for example a four-year-old would become the ruler

266
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,780
He's just sitting there in his diapers. He's ruling China. You know

267
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,580
They're like, I don't know who's gonna come and kill him. So he's got milk, but his authority is not settled

268
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,340
It's not actually he's not invincible. He's not someone who cannot be overpowered. So it's shaky

269
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:23,100
So he's got milk, but he doesn't have is that lies and Malik and an Aziz at the same time. Okay, so

270
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,820
now

271
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,860
Let's talk about the Aziz and al-Hakim actually

272
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,020
Let me tell you a little bit about a Hakim and then we'll talk about that and then I'll give you your first break

273
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,180
so

274
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,380
Hikku or Hakama, this is actually the first was Hakama to insaamullah inna Hakama means the chin

275
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,060
There's a weird concept in Arabic the chin or this jawbone is called Hakama for human beings

276
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,060
It's also called that for for sheep and the idea is it holds your face together

277
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
It holds your face in place

278
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,140
Is it this isn't there?

279
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
You know so

280
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Manaha min atta fakuk wa atta sayu

281
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,700
Sawa when cannot madia or ma'noia or kalaman meaning something that prevents something else from falling apart

282
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,940
The idea is the chin is keeping your face from

283
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,980
Falling apart. Okay, it's also a calm was also used for when they put the saddle on a horse

284
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,060
Sometimes they put a thing on a horse's chin and then you pull on it you pull on its neck, right?

285
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,100
That's actually an a cam also when a building is well structured

286
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,500
So it won't fall apart the foundations are strong the pillars are strong. They say oh, Kima till be now

287
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,820
Oh, Kima till be now and from it came the word hookum

288
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,100
Which you might be familiar with hookum means a verdict or a decision and a hakim is a ruler, right?

289
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,700
But a ruler who makes firm decisions well thought out decisions from this

290
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,980
We also get the idea of Hikma anyone know what Hikma means

291
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,700
Wisdom the concept of wisdom in Arabic is really interesting. It is actually based on the idea that you've

292
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,340
considered all of the factors and

293
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:01,060
After considering all of the factors you have an opinion. That's a very firmly rooted

294
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,460
So that this decision you're making or this idea you have won't fall apart

295
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,700
You know, it's not whimsical. It's not flimsy. It's very well thought out. It's it's secure

296
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,340
Like the chin holding the face secure right or the building being well built

297
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,180
Ideas that are well built well tested. They don't fall apart

298
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,260
They though the sum of those ideas become Hikman they become wisdom

299
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
Okay, so he says

300
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,960
The best of knowledge

301
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,340
Based on the best of knowledge and the best of know how you understand how to take the best course of action

302
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
That would be Hikma

303
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:46,020
Hikma is also used in Arabic for wise sayings. I gotta learn some German wise sayings before I go

304
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,700
Everywhere I go, I gotta I have to learn some wise sayings like I learned one wise saying in in Malaysia

305
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,180
I'm gonna butcher it. They say do it first say sorry later

306
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:07,140
Because if you ask permission first, what are they gonna say no, so just do it and then say sorry

307
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,700
Very wise, yeah, it really works. Okay, don't try this at all

308
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,660
Especially not a Islam like do it first and then yes, sorry Allah

309
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,660
I'm Malaysian wisdom

310
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,340
Anyway, so

311
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,340
the idea of wisdom in

312
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,820
Islamic literature Hikma is actually a really strong idea tomorrow

313
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,740
I'm probably gonna have a special 30-minute session with you guys just on wisdom because

314
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
this is a huge concept and

315
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,460
We have very a variety of ideas of what wisdom means, right?

316
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,020
And we I want to get get develop a Quran inspired concept of what it means to have wisdom

317
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,780
So this is Allah's name and Hakim which basically comes down to two things the decision maker

318
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,020
But the decision maker who makes decisions based on wisdom

319
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,700
Okay, so he has hukum which means he has the power to make decisions, but he makes them based on

320
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,860
Wisdom and wisdom means you considered all the factors

321
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,340
Right a

322
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,300
Hakim is different from a qadi a qadi just makes a judgment a hakim says oh you have a cake

323
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,220
You have a situation you want me to solve it?

324
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:22,020
Let me find out all the other witnesses all the other situations because if I make this decision who else will this impact?

325
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,820
What will be the trickle effect?

326
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:30,260
You know like the butterfly effect thing what will be the domino effect of this decision if I considered everything that I made a

327
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,300
Decision that would be a hakim because he used proper Hikma. Okay?

328
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,820
Now and Aziz al-Hakim are paired together 47 times in the Quran

329
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,820
So we should learn something about that if

330
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,540
Let's think about a human being before we think about Allah if a human being has complete authority you could do whatever you want

331
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,780
You could do whatever you want you have complete power

332
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,380
Authority that is unquestioned can often be associated with unwise rash and

333
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,280
Unilateral decisions. I'm gonna do whatever I want because I'm the king I

334
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,940
Well, I said I want this I said kill that person. I said let this one go. I you know and you just become a

335
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:15,180
Like a tantrum child you could just do whatever you want because you have no controls over you

336
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,740
That's why rulers of the past had wise counsel and even now presidents have a cabinet

337
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:29,300
Right an advisor strategic advisors. So the president. Ah, man, these you know, like in like in sitting in America

338
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:36,280
Some president these Russians they're annoying me. Let's bomb them and then I'm just in the mood to bomb while he's eating his french fries

339
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:44,320
Right then the strategic at sir actually it will cause this following chain respect and this is gonna affect the economy in this way and politics in this way and this

340
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,160
Can't bomb anyone it's been so long I spent like three months. I didn't bomb anyone like

341
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:59,240
In other words if you just have absolute authority then it will create disaster and

342
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,560
In the human realm in the human realm and so human beings since the beginning whenever you have authority

343
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
They have to have some kind of what?

344
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,220
Counsel some kind of wise counsel and if you don't have that they have for example in the American constitutional system

345
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,840
They have something called checks and balances. They didn't want to give the president all the authority

346
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,000
The government was divided into the executive branch the legislative branch the judicial branch three different branches

347
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,880
Why because if you give all the authority to the president

348
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,480
Then that's going to turn into a dictatorship and it's going to be unwise

349
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,360
Right, so you have to break up the authority the is that is actually broken up and they thought this will be the wiser approach

350
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,440
It can also be associated with whimsical decisions that sway from one direction to another

351
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,200
spontaneously in other words one day the king says

352
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,920
Get out of here. I never want to see you again. The next day. He says hey, where's that guy? I miss him. I like his jokes

353
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,040
The king can change his mood

354
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,840
Split second and the whole law changes in the country if you're living in a dictatorship your entire nation depends on the king's mood

355
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,680
Because he's running a dictatorship and this is not just about kings and large authorities. Sometimes you have dictators in a family

356
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,400
Sometimes you have dictators in a company. You already the company's one day. We're going this way one day. We're going that way

357
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
One day you're fired one day. You're hired

358
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,720
You know you never know based on their mood

359
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,160
So what is missing when people tend to have authority?

360
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
Wisdom seems to be missing

361
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,200
Take back step back. Consider all the factors before you make a decision

362
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,760
Know what you're getting what are the ramifications? What are the consequences?

363
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,320
Are you going to be taking this decision back tomorrow? Is this just emotion or is this actually well thought out?

364
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,640
meaning in in in the world in life when we think of is

365
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,160
Is that

366
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,600
Many times the more is that someone has the less Hikmah they have

367
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,480
The less Hikmah they have Allah Azza which has described himself perfectly a lot of Aziz

368
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,880
But at the and separately as a hakeem, but now they're together

369
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,960
He's the only Aziz. That's truly also what?

370
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,000
And hakeem

371
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,320
This is his authority always executed with the highest levels of wisdom and

372
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,480
Even above all of that Allah says about himself

373
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,520
So those those two names have something to do with each other

374
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,160
But we there's two other names we didn't compare to each other which are al-Quddus and al-Hakeem

375
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
al-Quddus is

376
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:31,480
The sanctified one and it's connected with heavenly matters. I've talked about before right so the spiritual matters the matters of goodness

377
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,480
And morality they are they exist in reclusion meaning they don't deal with worldly things

378
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,200
I don't want to know about the market. I don't know what I don't want about the social situation or the political situation

379
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,840
I just want to know about what's happening what's right and wrong in the heavenly sense in the spiritual sense the wise council

380
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,120
By the way kings in the past they had two kinds of advisors

381
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,800
They had the spiritual advisor and they had the strategic advisors

382
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,920
Okay, so the the king would go to the pope or the church or whatever for blessings and prayers and what should I do?

383
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,400
And they would go to their military advisors and their economic advisors for what should I do?

384
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,560
And were they always on the same page these two advisors? No, they hate each other

385
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,040
Like why is he listening to him? Why is he listening to him?

386
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,480
I remember when the first time a catholic became president in the united states and jonah f canady became president

387
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,440
There was a whole issue in the us about well, he's catholic. So is he loyal to the constitution or is he loyal to the pope?

388
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,040
And if he goes and has a conversation with the pope and the pope tells him issue this policy go against this policy

389
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,680
Is he going to follow that or that? Where's his loyalty big?

390
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,240
You know, is he going to follow his council coming from the muqaddas side?

391
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,240
Or is he going to follow his actual cabinet the hikmah side two different sides?

392
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:50,360
And so in a sense the muqaddas class concerns itself with the inwardly and the wise council with the outwardly

393
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:56,600
Allah needs no council. Allah needs no ex inwardly. He's himself al-quddus and he is himself

394
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,560
Al-hakim no other king can be this

395
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
No other king can be like this

396
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,400
So this in this way now now you'll understand this point

397
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,920
Kings had two kinds of council in the past spiritual and strategic

398
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Many times the two were at odds with each other a lot in these names establishes the most complete description of kingdom

399
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,440
His kingdom encompasses righteous holiness direct authority with invincible power

400
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,040
Wisdom and secure governance taking all factors into account

401
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:30,200
Meaning this is the most perfect kind of kingdom and on top of that then Allah then you understand what Allah says when he says

402
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Fa'alul limayuri he does whatever he wants

403
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,880
Now when he says you he does whatever he wants. It's not like when a human being does whatever they want

404
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,000
This is a higher level of whatever he wants

405
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,120
And so now you come back to this behan bi end this session

406
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,520
This description covers every flaw that all kingdoms otherwise have

407
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
You can have a kingdom that doesn't have the authority

408
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,800
You can have a kingdom that isn't righteous. You can have a kingdom that doesn't have the wise council

409
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,520
You can have things missing

410
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,240
But the focus on wamaa fel ard

411
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,680
In yusab bi hurlillahimafi as-samawatu wa-awafil ard

412
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,560
Is qunaya that it is time that people of the world recognize this truth and were introduced to Allah's perfect kingdom

413
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:19,080
They need to recognize who Allah is they'll recognize what the perfect kingdom of Allah looks like there must be some perfect way

414
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,080
To introduce them to this king so they too become people of what?

415
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,040
To speak if the kingdom is perfect

416
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,240
Then that king deserves to be considered perfect

417
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,040
And if you consider someone perfect, what do you do of them? You do to speak of them

418
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Now you understand the logic of the ayah

419
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,320
You subbi hurlillahimafi as-samawatu wa-awafil ard

420
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,200
Al-malik al-quddus al-aziz al-hakib

421
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,560
As we get to the end of this ayah now we will see now that Allah has described himself as the perfect king

422
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,560
And everybody does this be all the rest of creation know this it seems the only ones who don't really know this are

423
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,280
Human beings there must be a way for human beings to get to know this king

424
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,600
And how perfect he is and that's what the subject matter of the second ayah is going to be

425
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,960
I'll give you guys your first break baraka allah wa-awakum as-samawalikum wa-awafil al-hamdullahi wa-awakum

426
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,960
Here's what's coming up in the next episode and this deeper look of surah al-jumu'ah

427
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,360
So when you develop that love of of Quran of contemplation of study then the way you're going to start talking about it

428
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,960
You're not you're not going to have to take some course on public speaking

429
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:29,640
Or how do I you know you're not your aim is not to become a public speaker or an influencer most influencers are influenced

430
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
or under the influence

431
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,720
But the the idea is that you want to become a public figure

432
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,120
The idea is you should be able to speak passionately about something that inspires you
