{"text": " This idea of the sense of superiority over others Afflicted this ummah and this is the exact thing. Oh, I'm telling you Allah pointed out that the Israelites had this mentality and Allah's corrected that mentality and gave this this deen to the entire world and Now each one of us became many Israelites Salam alaikum before you begin this video just quickly wanted to let you know that So much of the work on the Quran has been completed on bayna TV I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in Brief and then in great detail and to do that I'd like for you to sign up on bayna TV calm and once you appreciate what's going on in bayna TV I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also Thank you. Then we get to this next high where Allah says nadika fadlullahi yuqiz mayan That is that is a favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants Well, Allah with the phabda Ali and Allah is the owner of the ultimate favor I want you to first understand the meaning of the word phabda the favor what I'm calling favor Fadlah means if somebody has a really long dress or a cloak like royals used to wear clothes But they used to drag behind them right or you might see you don't watch movies But you'll have a royal holding up his garb or the servants holding up their garb when they're walking that excess stuff is called Fadlah actually the excess long part is called Fadlah Fawad al-Mu'maad is basically profits from your property or your business. So your bonus is a Fadlah Your bonus or your extra profits your extra sales are a Fadlah or sometimes in America. I don't know how taxes work here, but Sometimes the government actually gives you back some money After you pay them taxes you get a tax return Right and when you get that return, it's a little bit of a fuzzles Okay, so that that fuzzle is extra. You didn't expect it. It's more above above and beyond Fadlah who this is reversed in Tech sequence Fadlah who had a guy to he to raise someone above someone else to give someone an extra advantage over somebody else This is an important word and I'll show you why before I get to this I What did Allah say about the Israelites? He said I Gave you an advantage. I gave you an extra advantage and I gave you a preference over all other nations That's what Allah told Bani Israel. He gave them more profits than anybody else He gave them more chances than anybody else They lost the Torah multiple times. It was restored for them multiple times Allah is now using the word fadlah after saying first of all He sent a messenger among the Umayyid and then he opened the door to all nations and That is the fadlah of Allah The word fadlah is particularly important now because now the fadlah has moved. Oh, what just happened? The fadlah has moved from one to the other now I wanted you to see one more thing in surat al-hadid this series of surahs I'll just highlight the bottom. I actually li'Allah ya'alama ahlul kitabi, Allah yaqdiruna ala shayin min fadlillah Wa'an ma'l fadlabiya dillahi yu'tihim anyasha. Wa'allahu ala fadlil azeem I'll tell you something brief about surat al-hadid 57. This is 62. That's surah number 57 Allah there talks about how Nations that came the people of the book the Jews and the Christians are so Confident that you have nothing that your book and your prophet is nothing and They have dismissed it because they don't think it's possible that the Umayyid these Arabs They're gonna have a prophet come on Why would they be blessed? What do they have? You know, they couldn't accept that someone from that lower nation could be blessed Because of that they will never even give it time to think about the word of Allah that you've been given They won't even consider it. It's not even on their radar And when it's not on their radar Allah says one of the punishments of those arrogant people is they don't even get to know That they no longer control or they have never have any control over the favor of Allah and he gives his favor to whoever he wants At the mufasirun said the favor of Allah here is the Quran They don't even know what they're missing They have no idea and Allah says part of the goal is they won't even get the arrogant one amongst them They will not even get to know they won't even know what they're missing and that's a punishment on them The ones among them that are curious Allah will expose them to it and he describes that in other places But this is among them the ones that are very you know, yes, they have a sense of supremacy and What has been given to Muhammad Salli Shallam is inferior. It's less than what they have So they'll never consider it Allah says yeah, you won't consider it and I will no longer let you consider it because of your attitude So that's the fadr of Allah that they're missing out now look at what Allah says about his father He says you have to follow the Rahmatih I don't believe this in the Quran he He especially chooses with his love and care whoever he wants Well, I will do for the Azeem and Allah owns the ultimate father You do you know may yasha'u fee rahmatihi he brings into his father whoever he wants What volume you know I had that home I'd a ban Aadima now This idea that this prophet is not just for the errors He's actually for all of humanity and the doors have been opened for all of humanity a couple of times in the Quran Allah says this about his prophet so by Allah, I'm saying I'm gonna I Didn't send you except as a Rahma for all nations in all peoples An important thing and another one when I saw that I'd like a fat and the nasi basheer and when I did I we didn't send you except as a Except for all of people To give good news and to give one warning well, I can not for a Nasi la alamoon most people have no idea Oh the thing I want you guys to hear especially the younger students here the younger college students and young men and women That are here. I want you to understand something Islam became global Islam was meant to be global not Arab culture Arab culture is Arab culture and Allah created Indonesian culture and Allah also allowed for Sri lankan culture to develop an Indian culture to develop an African cultures to develop Islam did not come so everyone around the world wears throbs and Everyone says hey, what are people in Saudi are wearing? Let me copy that because I want to be more Islamic That's not why Islam came It's not did that come for that reason The you know we developed this idea that the more you look like an Arab It's but not even every Arab the more you look like an Arab from the Gulf The more Islamic you are I Don't know where you got this idea from but it's definitely not the Quran The Sahaba themselves they went to Rome Arab Sahaba went to Rome and put on Roman clothes They did that well I gave guidelines on how you should dress But not what you should wear how you should wear How you should wear? You and this this idea it makes me sad sometimes because you know sometimes you be you beat young men That don't know any Arabic They don't know much about their Dean, but they're rocking like the most Khalid you you're you're from Kosovo, bro Why are you wearing that? As-Salamu Alaikum wa rahmatullahi yaa Akhi I was like, why are you Kosovo? No, no, no, that's all I know. I just want to sound like Well, you could just say bro you could you don't say yaa he's not more Islamic than bro So, okay It's good So we we became a You know the idea that somehow copying Arab culture makes you more religious or somehow that's a superior culture is actually what Islam came to end Allah says they began as what I don't mean Right now the alien There were a culture with no heritage and Allah decided to elevate them and by result He's decided to elevate other nations, but then here's the tragedy Who was being taught a lesson in these ayat? I've showed you now who was being taught a lesson who thought they were better These realites so I'm doing that we learned that lesson now. No Pakistani thinks that they're better than Bangladesh's Hamdolillah No, Indonesian thinks they're better than the Malaysians or the Malays think that the Malay Malays think they're better than the Indian Malays They don't think that ever again The Albanians and the Kosovans equal in every way I mean the Algerians Moroccans and Tunisians best friends Nobody thinks they're better than anybody else. You know The the Qataris and the Saudis You know everybody gets along We don't think anybody is less than us or more than us, but you know Muslims in Muslims in India and Muslims in Pakistan best friends forever right The whole point of this was now humanity will see themselves They will see a people that come from different cultures different backgrounds different clothes Different food different language, but one thing unites them and makes them equal like nothing else and that's their Islam and if we don't hold on to that and We said and by the way that doesn't mean we should all dress the same way or look the same way or talk the same way Allah's design was diversity that was his design but when we start Celebrating our culture our heritage as somehow superior to somebody else's and Then what we did is it wasn't enough that this was happening in our home or it was happening in our country We wanted to bring that into our musket the Allah's house Allah's house So now you can have a musket in in certain countries You can have a musket where it could be that there's a one community there the majority that neighborhood, right? So you go to Steinway Street. There's a lot of you know Moroccans inside There's a Moroccan musket you consider the Moroccan musket, but other people go there too Right, it's just it's a lot of house But now when what starts happening in some places is when other people go there they look at them But other that's not how you pray They won't talk like that to one of their own, but they'll talk like that when there's a foreigner Or somebody else They'll do that. So one one thing that became is certain races started becoming uncomfortable with certain other races But then there's another kind of father The Israelites developed the idea that the ones among them who have knowledge are better than the ones among them who don't have knowledge The knowledgeable ones are better than the ones who don't have knowledge and then they had strong disagreements with each other So what did alhamdulillah Muslims never do? If you walk into a musket and you don't look like you don't pray like everybody else in that much of this brain Your beard does not fit the uniform beard standard for that musket or You know we start Hmm this guy huh I see Unfortunately he's going to help Because he's not wearing the he's not wearing the gender uniform Clearly nobody gave him the memo This idea of the sense of superiority over others afflicted this umma and This is the exact thing. Oh, I'm telling you Allah pointed out that the Israelites had this mentality and Allah corrected that mentality and gave this this dean to the entire world and now each one of us became many Israelites That's just that's the sad thing. I mean it hurts me to say that But we have to you can't fix something if you don't identify the problem There's a hadith of the Prophet's life of a lot men mirror at all women The believer is a mirror of the believer if there's a stain on here The mirror will so there's a stain and the stain that I see then hurts me is that we became either nationalistic Tribal we became extremely tribal or We became extremely arrogant in terms of our own religious understanding. I Learned from my sheikh. This is the hub which means that all of you are but the heads You know that all of you are wrong none of you can be right This kind of like us versus them me versus everyone else this kind of mentality is what Islam came to eradicate It and just think about early Islam for a moment Just sometimes you should just stop and think about early Islam and you're you'll be amazed When the soul of Allah, so long as I'm gave his final speech And he said for you but the rest of the ride the ones who are here should spread to the ones who are not here How many people were in front of him thousands? Are they all the same level of knowledge the thousands of people? What do you think? Same or no Some people know more some people know less Do we say by the way when you set spend it to share with someone else make sure you bring them back So they learn from the pop proper highest knowledgeable people and then only and only otherwise don't share anything Don't say anything Islam spread organically and Islam somebody knew two suras they went and shared what? two suras Somebody knew the entire Quran they share the entire Quran Somebody knew if they knew how to pray they just taught somebody else what how to pray? That's it. That's what I learned and they shared it and the knowledge organically started spreading and that's the early victories of Islam They spread in this way. What did we do centuries later? No, no, no, no, you can't pray No, I can't teach you how to pray. I'm not certified. I didn't get four masters degrees in how to pray. I can't tell you how to pray Me teach you Fatihah. No, no, no When it comes to Fatihah, I know as much as a Christian or June or atheists How could I do you need to get me certified PhD to teach you how to recite the fat? crazy people This this is insane This is not how Islam began We took the focal of Allah and removed it people started they learned a little and then it puts pressure on me If I'm gonna share with someone else I should try to learn some more and Everybody took personal responsibility. What did we do? No, no, no, no responsibility goes only to scholars. I Don't have to do anything The average Muslim had to be a minimum level of educated so they can be a contributor You see so they can be helpful You didn't have to all become scholars We didn't have to become scholars, but we didn't have to become learned and you have to find somebody you can learn from and they can And then they get asked somebody comes and asked me I don't have the answer now I have to go learn from someone else and then share back and it wasn't about pride or ego The problem is when you have one group of people that says we have all the knowledge Come and ask us if you don't ask us then you're gonna get misguided then those people develop their own kind of arrogance They develop their own kind of elite status which happened in previous religions There needs to be a Transparent connection between scholars and the people and everything in between an open transparent connection And that was what was that's what's missing so far. Okay. Now anyway, look at the open invitation I'll wrap this up quickly So lafa'u laika ma'allatheena an'amallahu alayhim whoever would obey Allah and the messenger Whoever did Allah specify which ethnicity which nation the open invite whoever would obey Allah and the messenger Then they are among those who Allah has blessed from among the prophets and the ones who accepted the truth and the martyrs and good people What hasuna wulaika Rafiqat and what a beautiful company that is meaning if you join these people You're good people You are considered in the same group as the shohadah the siddiqun and you can even join the company of the prophets You can be with them in jannah too That equal for moving Allah that is the favor from Allah before a puddle again That's an open invite from Allah. It's not just an invite to accept Islam. It's an invite to eventually be in the company of prophets What a puddle of Allah all the heroes of our history we can join them We can be among them Yeah, you had the name of Allah now the other side of the fadda. This is the scary side of the fadda Please listen to this. I don't swear at the end of the hour. Listen to this part carefully Please yeah, you had nothing I'm on those of you who claim to believe May I tell them in come on the enemy whoever among you starts walking away from his or her religion You start taking steps back from your religion So so far you're coming common then Allah will bring a new nation Allah will bring a new nation you have boom. What you have bought a wolf a Nation who he will love and they will love him Meaning Allah is saying you're taking steps back because clearly you don't love me enough That's why you're taking steps back and if you don't love me enough There's plenty of people that I will love and they will what? They'll love me back and If you if you want to take steps back, that's fine. That's your choice But the word the invitation is open to the entire world. You're not a special race That only has to be you now. It's open to the whole world. So on the one side That's a good thing on the other side. It also makes us replaceable. You understand It could be that the the Pakistanis the Beledishees the Egyptians the Moroccans They don't uphold Allah's book and the led the sides. No, you know what? I'm gonna replace you with the Germans in a hundred years They're they're all gonna be they're gonna carry my religion now I'm gonna replace you with the Italians. They're gonna carry my religion. He could do that He's done that before He's done that before the Tatar The vast majority of them who slaughtered Muslims Or then basically carrying Islam for the next few centuries So if I had to know Allah will replace one nation with Another nation completely so if I could now be common you have a home where you have one out of the net in Azzatina He that describes what is it about them that I will love why will they replace you what quality will they have that clearly you don't have They'll be very humble before believers and they'll be tough against enemies You know what Muslims became really tough against each other very humble before enemies Isn't it Allah says I Jaheduna They'll struggle in the path of Allah And they will not be afraid of the criticism that comes from anyone who criticizes They will not be people who fear criticism Now just internalize these words. How many people take steps back from Islam because they are afraid of what? criticism From the family criticism from the workplace criticism from the university criticism from people riding on the bus Criticism I can't do this thing. I don't you know, unless this way You want to take steps back your choice Allah will bring about new people That he will love And they will love him I met somebody who told me they have a really hard time Where they women for example to struggle with hijab for different reasons I've realized that after talking to hundreds of sisters. It's not one reason there's a and I empathize one reason though is really epic I've never heard that one before so I'll tell you I just think that because I come from a country the women that wear hijab are all villagers So they're uneducated. So when I see a hijabi woman, I think of an uneducated woman I don't want to be associated with uneducated people. That's why I don't wear hijab. I mean, that's a new one You are on I mean, that's honest enough to share with me because most people when they have that kind of an ugly opinion They don't share it. They just say I just you know something in me But that's pretty raw. That's that's honest. I respect it. I respect it and I'm like and on the flip side you have a young woman who You know, where's the hijab gets rejected from college university applications gets reserved from job offers because she's wearing the hijab And then doesn't Allah keeps opening He closes a thousand doors and he opens a new door from in Haifu la-ihtasib from where she couldn't even imagine And she gets her education gets her and she's some of the highest ranking phd's in many countries are hijabi women Right and I look at that and say okay. Here's a person who says I don't want to be associated with what? uneducated people and that person wasn't able to complete their education And on the flip side You got people that are ignorant villagers the umi yin apparently That are reaching the height of heights right So Allah will replace He'll replace individuals. He'll replace nations If that's our attitude, Allah says I don't need your attitude Take it somewhere else. Take it to tiktok Okay, that's not what he says. That's what I'm saying. Okay Okay Same words that is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants. Isn't that the word we're studying? Here he said I've opened it up to all nations. That's the favor of Allah there. He says by the way you take steps back I have many other nations to choose from That is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants and now the words man yasha Man is an innocent musul yasha is a musul and because they are both who I'm being technical But that's okay. You'll get over it both who are it gives you two meanings at the same time What it one gives you one meaning it gives you is that is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever Allah wants The other meaning is that is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever actually wants it I'll say that again. That is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever Actually wants it So the you don't get to say oh, he chooses whoever he wants what what can I do? No, you didn't want it because if you want that there's no way he won't give it to you There's no way he won't give it to you subhanallah. Yeah, there's um Let me just see oh Okay, I'll hear other two done. I'm gonna finish this I want to start the next session with the next I because that's heavy So I'll hear other two done. I'm gonna kiss me. I mean Allah's intention Allah wants I translated Allah wants. Yeah Uh, the warrant in Arabic these two words Sha'a and Arada Sha'a and Arada. So the irada of Allah is the intent of Allah and the mashia of Allah is also the intent of Allah But what's the difference between them? I want you to it's a subtle Quran thing because you know in translation you'll just see Allah wants But I want you to know the difference between them. Yeah So the word Shah comes from Shay Shay you know what Shay means in Arabic? Allah who Allah kundi Shay in qadir I think something solid When Allah has decided something and it's set it's solid then you see what word Shah If you see irada, you'll see Allah wants something but it will depend on you For example, Allah will say you need a lot with you. Huff if I go Allah wants by teaching you the laws Allah wants to make your life lighter Allah wants to make your life what? Lighter but whether your life becomes lighter or not depends on who? Depends on you because if you don't follow the laws your life will not become Lighter, but if Allah has the mashia If he does Shah Allah That means whether you apply it or not your life will definitely become Lighters guarantees it's done. It's solidified But irada means Allah has made the intent But now it's up to you whether you want that intent to be fulfilled You need to Allah who do you obey in a vacuum Allah wants to make things clear for you Allah says Allah wants to make things clear for you. Is there a part of that that depends on you? It does isn't it you have to go learn you have to seek that clarity you need to Allah who do you obey in a If you don't do your part that it will not become what? Clear if that was the mashia of Allah Whether you tried or not everybody would have clarity without any attempt at themselves So that's the difference between Shah and irada and here guys you're distracting everybody It's okay. What happened nothing happened. This is nothing Three people I would have tolerated four or five and everybody's like what are they talking? God this is this is the tragedy of education I don't get tired of telling the same jokes as you may have already known So I'll tell you the same old joke It's not a joke. It's actually I it's my jokes are actually my trauma is what it is Okay I made the mistake of teaching an Arabic program Arabic class In a classroom where imagine my class by my podium was there and behind me was a giant window And my students are looking at me and they're also Looking out the window and behind the window in the distance. There was a highway cars I kid you not my students I could look at their face and tell if there's traffic When there's traffic they're doing this What there's no traffic to do One of my students really likes trucks I can tell us there's a truck on the highway. He's looking at me. Look at me or there he goes When you're in a lecture everything other than the lecture becomes interesting Poor belayin comes and talks to us man about some issue and you're all like What are they? I want to know I want to know what they're talking about If this was not a lecture you would not care That would not be important to you. But it's because it's a lecture This becomes you guys know this in Jumaah Khutbah. Jumaah Khutbah Is you know, it's mashallah. So some of you you hear in the I like that's in between your ashab al kahab, right? That's that's Friday. So it makes sense. So But what do people do they're like now who's gonna walk in? And this musket is especially challenging because the carpet is very simple So you can't even look at the lines that would go like this and that and make up your own faces in it, you know So That is the favor of Allah He gives it to whoever he decides to give it to and whoever makes the firm decision to get it Sha'a strong decision will solid will and Allah possesses the ultimate favor Many mufasir would have commented over and over again that the fadal of Allah is also referring to the Quran Allah possesses the ultimate favor. That is that the favor of Allah is the Quran Abba aza fi al ummiyina rasul an Rasul himself is on Quran and yamshi the Quran walking around is the prophet Salallahu alayhi wa sallam, right?
