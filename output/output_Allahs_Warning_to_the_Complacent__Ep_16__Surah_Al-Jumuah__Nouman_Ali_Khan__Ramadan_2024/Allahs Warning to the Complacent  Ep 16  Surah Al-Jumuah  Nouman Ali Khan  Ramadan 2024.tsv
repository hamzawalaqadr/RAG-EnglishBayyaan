0	3080	This idea of the sense of superiority over others
4200	12160	Afflicted this ummah and this is the exact thing. Oh, I'm telling you Allah pointed out that the Israelites had this mentality and
12960	17720	Allah's corrected that mentality and gave this this deen to the entire world and
18240	21140	Now each one of us became many Israelites
21500	29940	Salam alaikum before you begin this video just quickly wanted to let you know that
30300	33220	So much of the work on the Quran has been completed on bayna TV
33220	37360	I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in
37540	40180	Brief and then in great detail and to do that
40180	44940	I'd like for you to sign up on bayna TV calm and once you appreciate what's going on in bayna TV
44940	50100	I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also
50100	53100	Thank you. Then we get to this next high where Allah says
53100	55100	nadika fadlullahi yuqiz mayan
55500	59740	That is that is a favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants
59740	63500	Well, Allah with the phabda Ali and Allah is the owner of the ultimate favor
63500	67560	I want you to first understand the meaning of the word phabda the favor what I'm calling favor
67980	73860	Fadlah means if somebody has a really long dress or a cloak like royals used to wear clothes
73860	78520	But they used to drag behind them right or you might see you don't watch movies
78520	85360	But you'll have a royal holding up his garb or the servants holding up their garb when they're walking that excess stuff is called
85720	88920	Fadlah actually the excess long part is called Fadlah
89240	94200	Fawad al-Mu'maad is basically profits from your property or your business. So your bonus is a Fadlah
94720	102160	Your bonus or your extra profits your extra sales are a Fadlah or sometimes in America. I don't know how taxes work here, but
103200	105500	Sometimes the government actually gives you back some money
106260	108760	After you pay them taxes you get a tax return
109380	111940	Right and when you get that return, it's a little bit of a fuzzles
112700	118180	Okay, so that that fuzzle is extra. You didn't expect it. It's more above above and beyond
118700	120700	Fadlah who this is reversed in
121420	128140	Tech sequence Fadlah who had a guy to he to raise someone above someone else to give someone an extra advantage over somebody else
128500	130580	This is an important word and I'll show you why
131860	133860	before I get to this I
134100	136100	What did Allah say about the Israelites?
136780	138780	He said
139620	140540	I
140540	146460	Gave you an advantage. I gave you an extra advantage and I gave you a preference over all other nations
146820	151260	That's what Allah told Bani Israel. He gave them more profits than anybody else
152140	154940	He gave them more chances than anybody else
155900	159860	They lost the Torah multiple times. It was restored for them multiple times
160260	165300	Allah is now using the word fadlah after saying first of all
165300	170220	He sent a messenger among the Umayyid and then he opened the door to all nations and
170700	173060	That is the fadlah of Allah
173420	179220	The word fadlah is particularly important now because now the fadlah has moved. Oh, what just happened?
180260	183300	The fadlah has moved from one to the other now
183300	186820	I wanted you to see one more thing in surat al-hadid this series of surahs
186820	188820	I'll just highlight the bottom. I actually
189140	194060	li'Allah ya'alama ahlul kitabi, Allah yaqdiruna ala shayin min fadlillah
194380	198300	Wa'an ma'l fadlabiya dillahi yu'tihim anyasha. Wa'allahu ala fadlil azeem
198300	203980	I'll tell you something brief about surat al-hadid 57. This is 62. That's surah number 57
205100	207100	Allah there talks about how
208580	213660	Nations that came the people of the book the Jews and the Christians are so
214020	220740	Confident that you have nothing that your book and your prophet is nothing and
221820	227220	They have dismissed it because they don't think it's possible that the Umayyid these Arabs
227500	229500	They're gonna have a prophet come on
230020	232020	Why would they be blessed? What do they have?
232580	238180	You know, they couldn't accept that someone from that lower nation could be blessed
239180	244940	Because of that they will never even give it time to think about the word of Allah that you've been given
245900	249180	They won't even consider it. It's not even on their radar
249180	256660	And when it's not on their radar Allah says one of the punishments of those arrogant people is they don't even get to know
256860	264260	That they no longer control or they have never have any control over the favor of Allah and he gives his favor to whoever he wants
264260	266740	At the mufasirun said the favor of Allah here is the Quran
267740	269740	They don't even know what they're missing
270500	276380	They have no idea and Allah says part of the goal is they won't even get the arrogant one amongst them
276380	281060	They will not even get to know they won't even know what they're missing and that's a punishment on them
281580	285780	The ones among them that are curious Allah will expose them to it and he describes that in other places
285780	290860	But this is among them the ones that are very you know, yes, they have a sense of supremacy and
291660	296380	What has been given to Muhammad Salli Shallam is inferior. It's less than what they have
296740	302460	So they'll never consider it Allah says yeah, you won't consider it and I will no longer let you consider it because of your attitude
302980	307700	So that's the fadr of Allah that they're missing out now look at what Allah says about his father
307940	312300	He says you have to follow the Rahmatih I don't believe this in the Quran he
313020	317420	He especially chooses with his love and care whoever he wants
317660	320860	Well, I will do for the Azeem and Allah owns the ultimate father
321300	327380	You do you know may yasha'u fee rahmatihi he brings into his father whoever he wants
328020	331260	What volume you know I had that home I'd a ban Aadima now
331900	335380	This idea that this prophet is not just for the errors
336020	341340	He's actually for all of humanity and the doors have been opened for all of humanity a couple of times in the Quran
341340	343980	Allah says this about his prophet so by Allah, I'm saying I'm gonna
344340	346340	I
346860	351160	Didn't send you except as a Rahma for all nations in all peoples
351940	358780	An important thing and another one when I saw that I'd like a fat and the nasi basheer and when I did I we didn't send you except as a
359580	361580	Except for all of people
361900	367220	To give good news and to give one warning well, I can not for a Nasi la alamoon most people have no idea
367220	373900	Oh the thing I want you guys to hear especially the younger students here the younger college students and young men and women
373900	375900	That are here. I want you to understand something
376860	380520	Islam became global Islam was meant to be global
381300	383300	not Arab culture
384220	386220	Arab culture is Arab culture and
386820	392180	Allah created Indonesian culture and Allah also allowed for Sri lankan culture to develop an
392420	398460	Indian culture to develop an African cultures to develop Islam did not come so everyone around the world
398660	400660	wears throbs and
401180	406220	Everyone says hey, what are people in Saudi are wearing? Let me copy that because I want to be more Islamic
407380	409380	That's not why Islam came
409460	411460	It's not did that come for that reason
411460	416220	The you know we developed this idea that the more you look like an Arab
416220	419140	It's but not even every Arab the more you look like an Arab from the Gulf
420380	422380	The more Islamic you are I
422900	426060	Don't know where you got this idea from but it's definitely not the Quran
426860	429540	The Sahaba themselves they went to Rome
430220	432980	Arab Sahaba went to Rome and put on Roman clothes
433700	437620	They did that well I gave guidelines on how you should dress
439340	442860	But not what you should wear how you should wear
443580	445580	How you should wear?
445580	450780	You and this this idea it makes me sad sometimes because you know sometimes you be you beat young men
451020	452580	That don't know any Arabic
452620	458340	They don't know much about their Dean, but they're rocking like the most Khalid you you're you're from Kosovo, bro
459980	461980	Why are you wearing that?
461980	463980	As-Salamu Alaikum wa rahmatullahi yaa Akhi
464060	466060	I was like, why are you Kosovo?
466140	468140	No, no, no, that's all I know. I just want to sound like
470460	474540	Well, you could just say bro you could you don't say yaa he's not more Islamic than bro
475700	477500	So, okay
477500	479180	It's good
479180	481180	So we we became a
481180	485020	You know the idea that somehow copying
485700	491740	Arab culture makes you more religious or somehow that's a superior culture is actually what Islam came to end
493060	495660	Allah says they began as what I don't mean
496660	498660	Right now the alien
500300	505860	There were a culture with no heritage and Allah decided to elevate them and by result
505860	509820	He's decided to elevate other nations, but then here's the tragedy
510580	515780	Who was being taught a lesson in these ayat? I've showed you now who was being taught a lesson who thought they were better
516740	522980	These realites so I'm doing that we learned that lesson now. No Pakistani thinks that they're better than Bangladesh's
523620	524700	Hamdolillah
524700	531220	No, Indonesian thinks they're better than the Malaysians or the Malays think that the Malay Malays think they're better than the Indian Malays
531340	533340	They don't think that ever again
533740	536860	The Albanians and the Kosovans equal in every way
537860	541220	I mean the Algerians Moroccans and Tunisians best friends
541940	544660	Nobody thinks they're better than anybody else. You know
545340	547340	The the Qataris and the Saudis
548020	550020	You know everybody gets along
550300	556200	We don't think anybody is less than us or more than us, but you know Muslims in Muslims in India and Muslims in Pakistan
557420	559140	best friends
559140	560740	forever
560740	562300	right
562300	566020	The whole point of this was now humanity will see themselves
566020	570500	They will see a people that come from different cultures different backgrounds different clothes
571540	577660	Different food different language, but one thing unites them and makes them equal like nothing else and that's their Islam
578420	579340	and
579340	581340	if we don't hold on to that and
582220	587780	We said and by the way that doesn't mean we should all dress the same way or look the same way or talk the same way
587780	590220	Allah's design was diversity that was his design
590420	593100	but when we start
594500	601060	Celebrating our culture our heritage as somehow superior to somebody else's and
601900	608020	Then what we did is it wasn't enough that this was happening in our home or it was happening in our country
608020	611620	We wanted to bring that into our musket the Allah's house
612140	613300	Allah's house
613300	616900	So now you can have a musket in in certain countries
616900	622220	You can have a musket where it could be that there's a one community there the majority that neighborhood, right?
622220	625700	So you go to Steinway Street. There's a lot of you know Moroccans inside
625700	629160	There's a Moroccan musket you consider the Moroccan musket, but other people go there too
630140	632060	Right, it's just it's a lot of house
632060	636360	But now when what starts happening in some places is when other people go there they look at them
639260	641260	But other that's not how you pray
642220	646100	They won't talk like that to one of their own, but they'll talk like that when there's a foreigner
646460	648060	Or somebody else
648060	655600	They'll do that. So one one thing that became is certain races started becoming uncomfortable with certain other races
656260	657940	But then there's another kind of father
657940	664300	The Israelites developed the idea that the ones among them who have knowledge are better than the ones among them who don't have knowledge
665140	670580	The knowledgeable ones are better than the ones who don't have knowledge and then they had strong disagreements with each other
670780	673300	So what did alhamdulillah Muslims never do?
674100	678780	If you walk into a musket and you don't look like you don't pray like everybody else in that much of this brain
680580	684860	Your beard does not fit the uniform beard standard for that musket or
686140	688140	You know we start
688940	690940	Hmm this guy huh I see
692620	694620	Unfortunately he's going to help
694980	697620	Because he's not wearing the he's not wearing the gender uniform
698540	700540	Clearly nobody gave him the memo
701420	704500	This idea of the sense of superiority over others
705620	707500	afflicted this umma and
707500	713620	This is the exact thing. Oh, I'm telling you Allah pointed out that the Israelites had this mentality and
714380	722580	Allah corrected that mentality and gave this this dean to the entire world and now each one of us became many Israelites
723900	726660	That's just that's the sad thing. I mean it hurts me to say that
726860	730620	But we have to you can't fix something if you don't identify the problem
730940	734060	There's a hadith of the Prophet's life of a lot men mirror at all women
734060	737460	The believer is a mirror of the believer if there's a stain on here
737460	743300	The mirror will so there's a stain and the stain that I see then hurts me is that we became either nationalistic
743980	746340	Tribal we became extremely tribal or
746900	751340	We became extremely arrogant in terms of our own religious understanding. I
752100	756540	Learned from my sheikh. This is the hub which means that all of you are but the heads
757540	760620	You know that all of you are wrong none of you can be right
761100	768260	This kind of like us versus them me versus everyone else this kind of mentality is what Islam came to eradicate
768860	772780	It and just think about early Islam for a moment
772780	778500	Just sometimes you should just stop and think about early Islam and you're you'll be amazed
778940	782900	When the soul of Allah, so long as I'm gave his final speech
783700	788780	And he said for you but the rest of the ride the ones who are here should spread to the ones who are not here
788780	790780	How many people were in front of him thousands?
791500	795060	Are they all the same level of knowledge the thousands of people? What do you think?
795540	796900	Same or no
796900	799580	Some people know more some people know less
800180	805580	Do we say by the way when you set spend it to share with someone else make sure you bring them back
805580	810100	So they learn from the pop proper highest knowledgeable people and then only and only otherwise don't share anything
810380	813740	Don't say anything Islam spread organically and
814700	817500	Islam somebody knew two suras they went and shared what?
818340	819980	two suras
819980	823060	Somebody knew the entire Quran they share the entire Quran
824420	828980	Somebody knew if they knew how to pray they just taught somebody else what how to pray?
828980	836980	That's it. That's what I learned and they shared it and the knowledge organically started spreading and that's the early victories of Islam
837820	842980	They spread in this way. What did we do centuries later? No, no, no, no, you can't pray
843820	849900	No, I can't teach you how to pray. I'm not certified. I didn't get four masters degrees in how to pray. I can't tell you how to pray
850860	853660	Me teach you Fatihah. No, no, no
855780	860340	When it comes to Fatihah, I know as much as a Christian or June or atheists
860340	864860	How could I do you need to get me certified PhD to teach you how to recite the fat?
865460	867460	crazy people
867500	869340	This this is insane
869340	871340	This is not how Islam began
871580	877180	We took the focal of Allah and removed it people started they learned a little and then it puts pressure on me
877180	880020	If I'm gonna share with someone else I should try to learn some more and
881140	887060	Everybody took personal responsibility. What did we do? No, no, no, no responsibility goes only to scholars. I
887980	889820	Don't have to do anything
889820	895420	The average Muslim had to be a minimum level of educated so they can be a contributor
895820	898060	You see so they can be helpful
898580	900420	You didn't have to all become scholars
900420	906340	We didn't have to become scholars, but we didn't have to become learned and you have to find somebody you can learn from and they can
906340	908540	And then they get asked somebody comes and asked me
908540	909780	I don't have the answer now
909780	914660	I have to go learn from someone else and then share back and it wasn't about pride or ego
914900	918220	The problem is when you have one group of people that says we have all the knowledge
918420	924860	Come and ask us if you don't ask us then you're gonna get misguided then those people develop their own kind of arrogance
925580	929460	They develop their own kind of elite status which happened in previous religions
930100	932100	There needs to be a
932500	938660	Transparent connection between scholars and the people and everything in between an open transparent connection
938660	945180	And that was what was that's what's missing so far. Okay. Now anyway, look at the open invitation
945180	947180	I'll wrap this up quickly
948220	952620	So lafa'u laika ma'allatheena an'amallahu alayhim whoever would obey Allah and the messenger
952820	958820	Whoever did Allah specify which ethnicity which nation the open invite whoever would obey Allah and the messenger
958820	965340	Then they are among those who Allah has blessed from among the prophets and the ones who accepted the truth and the martyrs and good people
965340	970740	What hasuna wulaika Rafiqat and what a beautiful company that is meaning if you join these people
970740	971860	You're good people
971860	978180	You are considered in the same group as the shohadah the siddiqun and you can even join the company of the prophets
978220	980220	You can be with them in jannah too
980220	984620	That equal for moving Allah that is the favor from Allah before a puddle again
984980	991700	That's an open invite from Allah. It's not just an invite to accept Islam. It's an invite to eventually be in the company of prophets
992540	996780	What a puddle of Allah all the heroes of our history we can join them
997260	999260	We can be among them
999260	1004260	Yeah, you had the name of Allah now the other side of the fadda. This is the scary side of the fadda
1004260	1008340	Please listen to this. I don't swear at the end of the hour. Listen to this part carefully
1008340	1011980	Please yeah, you had nothing I'm on those of you who claim to believe
1012220	1018140	May I tell them in come on the enemy whoever among you starts walking away from his or her religion
1018500	1020900	You start taking steps back from your religion
1021140	1025300	So so far you're coming common then Allah will bring a new nation
1026620	1031940	Allah will bring a new nation you have boom. What you have bought a wolf a
1032380	1035200	Nation who he will love and they will love him
1036380	1041560	Meaning Allah is saying you're taking steps back because clearly you don't love me enough
1042740	1045340	That's why you're taking steps back and if you don't love me enough
1045740	1048340	There's plenty of people that I will love and they will what?
1048900	1050820	They'll love me back and
1050820	1054260	If you if you want to take steps back, that's fine. That's your choice
1054460	1058480	But the word the invitation is open to the entire world. You're not a special race
1059200	1063600	That only has to be you now. It's open to the whole world. So on the one side
1063600	1067000	That's a good thing on the other side. It also makes us replaceable. You understand
1067840	1073520	It could be that the the Pakistanis the Beledishees the Egyptians the Moroccans
1073520	1079020	They don't uphold Allah's book and the led the sides. No, you know what? I'm gonna replace you with the Germans in a hundred years
1079840	1082480	They're they're all gonna be they're gonna carry my religion now
1083040	1087200	I'm gonna replace you with the Italians. They're gonna carry my religion. He could do that
1087840	1089680	He's done that before
1089680	1091680	He's done that before the Tatar
1092080	1094960	The vast majority of them who slaughtered Muslims
1095760	1099320	Or then basically carrying Islam for the next few centuries
1101480	1104000	So if I had to know Allah will replace one nation with
1104680	1109760	Another nation completely so if I could now be common you have a home where you have one out of the net in
1110080	1111760	Azzatina
1111760	1119040	He that describes what is it about them that I will love why will they replace you what quality will they have that clearly you don't have
1119040	1123920	They'll be very humble before believers and they'll be tough against enemies
1125280	1131460	You know what Muslims became really tough against each other very humble before enemies
1133040	1134560	Isn't it
1134800	1136560	Allah says
1136560	1138080	I
1138080	1139920	Jaheduna
1139920	1141920	They'll struggle in the path of Allah
1141920	1147360	And they will not be afraid of the criticism that comes from anyone who criticizes
1148400	1151200	They will not be people who fear criticism
1152000	1159200	Now just internalize these words. How many people take steps back from Islam because they are afraid of what?
1160480	1162480	criticism
1162720	1168800	From the family criticism from the workplace criticism from the university criticism from people riding on the bus
1169280	1172880	Criticism I can't do this thing. I don't you know, unless this way
1173600	1178000	You want to take steps back your choice Allah will bring about new people
1179200	1181200	That he will love
1181200	1183200	And they will love him
1183280	1185840	I met somebody who told me they have a really hard time
1186320	1190000	Where they women for example to struggle with hijab for different reasons
1190240	1197520	I've realized that after talking to hundreds of sisters. It's not one reason there's a and I empathize one reason though is really epic
1198720	1200720	I've never heard that one before so I'll tell you
1200720	1205040	I just think that because I come from a country the women that wear hijab are all villagers
1205440	1209920	So they're uneducated. So when I see a hijabi woman, I think of an uneducated woman
1210080	1214640	I don't want to be associated with uneducated people. That's why I don't wear hijab. I mean, that's a new one
1215440	1220960	You are on I mean, that's honest enough to share with me because most people when they have that kind of an ugly opinion
1220960	1224080	They don't share it. They just say I just you know something in me
1225920	1230160	But that's pretty raw. That's that's honest. I respect it. I respect it
1230880	1232000	and
1232000	1235120	I'm like and on the flip side you have a young woman who
1236400	1242960	You know, where's the hijab gets rejected from college university applications gets reserved from job offers because she's wearing the hijab
1243360	1245680	And then doesn't Allah keeps opening
1245680	1250480	He closes a thousand doors and he opens a new door from in Haifu la-ihtasib from where she couldn't even imagine
1250720	1257520	And she gets her education gets her and she's some of the highest ranking phd's in many countries are hijabi women
1258720	1264240	Right and I look at that and say okay. Here's a person who says I don't want to be associated with what?
1265280	1268400	uneducated people and that person wasn't able to complete their education
1268960	1270960	And on the flip side
1271600	1274080	You got people that are ignorant villagers
1274800	1276800	the umi yin apparently
1277840	1279840	That are reaching the height of heights
1280160	1281200	right
1281200	1282000	So
1282000	1284000	Allah will replace
1284000	1286320	He'll replace individuals. He'll replace nations
1286960	1289360	If that's our attitude, Allah says I don't need your attitude
1290160	1292160	Take it somewhere else. Take it to tiktok
1292720	1295120	Okay, that's not what he says. That's what I'm saying. Okay
1295440	1297440	Okay
1300000	1304960	Same words that is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants. Isn't that the word we're studying?
1306320	1311680	Here he said I've opened it up to all nations. That's the favor of Allah there. He says by the way you take steps back
1312080	1314080	I have many other nations to choose from
1314400	1319040	That is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants and now the words man yasha
1319280	1324000	Man is an innocent musul yasha is a musul and because they are both who I'm being technical
1324000	1328080	But that's okay. You'll get over it both who are it gives you two meanings at the same time
1328480	1333920	What it one gives you one meaning it gives you is that is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever Allah wants
1334800	1338960	The other meaning is that is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever actually wants it
1340560	1343440	I'll say that again. That is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever
1344320	1346320	Actually wants it
1348480	1353040	So the you don't get to say oh, he chooses whoever he wants what what can I do?
1354320	1358800	No, you didn't want it because if you want that there's no way he won't give it to you
1359760	1363200	There's no way he won't give it to you subhanallah. Yeah, there's um
1364480	1366480	Let me just see oh
1366480	1372880	Okay, I'll hear other two done. I'm gonna finish this I want to start the next session with the next I because that's heavy
1373360	1376480	So I'll hear other two done. I'm gonna kiss me. I mean Allah's intention
1377040	1379280	Allah wants I translated Allah wants. Yeah
1380000	1383040	Uh, the warrant in Arabic these two words Sha'a and Arada
1383760	1389760	Sha'a and Arada. So the irada of Allah is the intent of Allah and the mashia of Allah is also the intent of Allah
1389920	1391920	But what's the difference between them?
1392240	1396240	I want you to it's a subtle Quran thing because you know in translation you'll just see Allah wants
1396400	1398400	But I want you to know the difference between them. Yeah
1399440	1401440	So the word Shah comes from Shay
1402480	1405600	Shay you know what Shay means in Arabic? Allah who Allah kundi Shay in qadir
1406720	1408720	I think something solid
1409440	1414880	When Allah has decided something and it's set it's solid then you see what word
1415680	1417360	Shah
1417360	1422080	If you see irada, you'll see Allah wants something but it will depend on you
1422960	1426960	For example, Allah will say you need a lot with you. Huff if I go
1427680	1431680	Allah wants by teaching you the laws Allah wants to make your life lighter
1432720	1434720	Allah wants to make your life what?
1435120	1438720	Lighter but whether your life becomes lighter or not depends on who?
1439920	1443920	Depends on you because if you don't follow the laws your life will not become
1444720	1446720	Lighter, but if Allah has the mashia
1447360	1449360	If he does Shah Allah
1449760	1453040	That means whether you apply it or not your life will definitely become
1453680	1455680	Lighters guarantees it's done. It's solidified
1456320	1458560	But irada means Allah has made the intent
1459120	1462320	But now it's up to you whether you want that intent to be fulfilled
1462960	1466960	You need to Allah who do you obey in a vacuum Allah wants to make things clear for you
1468000	1472320	Allah says Allah wants to make things clear for you. Is there a part of that that depends on you?
1474000	1478880	It does isn't it you have to go learn you have to seek that clarity you need to Allah who do you obey in a
1480080	1482240	If you don't do your part that it will not become what?
1483120	1485120	Clear if that was the mashia of Allah
1485280	1489360	Whether you tried or not everybody would have clarity without any attempt at themselves
1489360	1494720	So that's the difference between Shah and irada and here guys you're distracting everybody
1497040	1500720	It's okay. What happened nothing happened. This is nothing
1503760	1508080	Three people I would have tolerated four or five and everybody's like what are they talking?
1510080	1512720	God this is this is the tragedy of education
1513600	1516240	I don't get tired of telling the same jokes as you may have already known
1517200	1519200	So I'll tell you the same old joke
1519600	1523760	It's not a joke. It's actually I it's my jokes are actually my trauma is what it is
1524960	1526960	Okay
1527600	1532000	I made the mistake of teaching an Arabic program Arabic class
1532960	1539040	In a classroom where imagine my class by my podium was there and behind me was a giant window
1540400	1542400	And my students are looking at me and they're also
1543360	1547680	Looking out the window and behind the window in the distance. There was a highway
1549360	1551360	cars
1552320	1558880	I kid you not my students I could look at their face and tell if there's traffic
1562960	1564960	When there's traffic they're doing this
1565920	1571120	What there's no traffic to do
1576320	1583120	One of my students really likes trucks I can tell us there's a truck on the highway. He's looking at me. Look at me or there he goes
1590080	1593600	When you're in a lecture everything other than the lecture becomes interesting
1595120	1598800	Poor belayin comes and talks to us man about some issue and you're all like
1600720	1602400	What are they?
1602400	1604880	I want to know I want to know what they're talking about
1605920	1608240	If this was not a lecture you would not care
1609520	1612480	That would not be important to you. But it's because it's a lecture
1612880	1615680	This becomes you guys know this in Jumaah Khutbah. Jumaah Khutbah
1616560	1619360	Is you know, it's mashallah. So some of you you hear in
1620160	1622160	the
1622640	1628320	I like that's in between your ashab al kahab, right? That's that's Friday. So it makes sense. So
1630400	1633360	But what do people do they're like now who's gonna walk in?
1638480	1641840	And this musket is especially challenging because the carpet is very simple
1642240	1647840	So you can't even look at the lines that would go like this and that and make up your own faces in it, you know
1650080	1652080	So
1656080	1657200	That is the favor of Allah
1657200	1661600	He gives it to whoever he decides to give it to and whoever makes the firm decision to get it
1662160	1667600	Sha'a strong decision will solid will and Allah possesses the ultimate favor
1668000	1673440	Many mufasir would have commented over and over again that the fadal of Allah is also referring to the Quran
1673920	1677600	Allah possesses the ultimate favor. That is that the favor of Allah is the Quran
1685920	1687680	Abba aza fi al ummiyina rasul an
1687680	1691440	Rasul himself is on Quran and yamshi the Quran walking around is the prophet
1691680	1695520	Salallahu alayhi wa sallam, right? So all of it boils down to the word of Allah
1695760	1698720	And that is the favor of Allah that they're missing out on
1699520	1701520	Salamu alaykum everyone
1701840	1706320	There are almost 50 000 students around the world that are interested on top of the students
1706400	1711440	We have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends
1711760	1717040	And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive. So if you can help sponsor students on bayna tv
1717120	1718880	Please do so and visit our sponsorship page
1718880	1723440	I appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran
1723760	1725760	And the beauty of it the world over
