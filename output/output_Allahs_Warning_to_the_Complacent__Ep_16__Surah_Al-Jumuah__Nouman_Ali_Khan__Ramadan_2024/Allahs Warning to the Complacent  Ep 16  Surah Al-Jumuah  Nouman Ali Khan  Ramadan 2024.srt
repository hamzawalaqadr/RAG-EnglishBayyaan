1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
This idea of the sense of superiority over others

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Afflicted this ummah and this is the exact thing. Oh, I'm telling you Allah pointed out that the Israelites had this mentality and

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,720
Allah's corrected that mentality and gave this this deen to the entire world and

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,140
Now each one of us became many Israelites

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:29,940
Salam alaikum before you begin this video just quickly wanted to let you know that

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,220
So much of the work on the Quran has been completed on bayna TV

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,360
I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,180
Brief and then in great detail and to do that

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,940
I'd like for you to sign up on bayna TV calm and once you appreciate what's going on in bayna TV

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,100
I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,100
Thank you. Then we get to this next high where Allah says

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
nadika fadlullahi yuqiz mayan

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,740
That is that is a favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,500
Well, Allah with the phabda Ali and Allah is the owner of the ultimate favor

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,560
I want you to first understand the meaning of the word phabda the favor what I'm calling favor

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,860
Fadlah means if somebody has a really long dress or a cloak like royals used to wear clothes

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,520
But they used to drag behind them right or you might see you don't watch movies

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,360
But you'll have a royal holding up his garb or the servants holding up their garb when they're walking that excess stuff is called

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,920
Fadlah actually the excess long part is called Fadlah

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,200
Fawad al-Mu'maad is basically profits from your property or your business. So your bonus is a Fadlah

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,160
Your bonus or your extra profits your extra sales are a Fadlah or sometimes in America. I don't know how taxes work here, but

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,500
Sometimes the government actually gives you back some money

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,760
After you pay them taxes you get a tax return

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,940
Right and when you get that return, it's a little bit of a fuzzles

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,180
Okay, so that that fuzzle is extra. You didn't expect it. It's more above above and beyond

26
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Fadlah who this is reversed in

27
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:08,140
Tech sequence Fadlah who had a guy to he to raise someone above someone else to give someone an extra advantage over somebody else

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,580
This is an important word and I'll show you why

29
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,860
before I get to this I

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
What did Allah say about the Israelites?

31
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,780
He said

32
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,540
I

33
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,460
Gave you an advantage. I gave you an extra advantage and I gave you a preference over all other nations

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,260
That's what Allah told Bani Israel. He gave them more profits than anybody else

35
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,940
He gave them more chances than anybody else

36
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,860
They lost the Torah multiple times. It was restored for them multiple times

37
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,300
Allah is now using the word fadlah after saying first of all

38
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,220
He sent a messenger among the Umayyid and then he opened the door to all nations and

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,060
That is the fadlah of Allah

40
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:59,220
The word fadlah is particularly important now because now the fadlah has moved. Oh, what just happened?

41
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,300
The fadlah has moved from one to the other now

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,820
I wanted you to see one more thing in surat al-hadid this series of surahs

43
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
I'll just highlight the bottom. I actually

44
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,060
li'Allah ya'alama ahlul kitabi, Allah yaqdiruna ala shayin min fadlillah

45
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,300
Wa'an ma'l fadlabiya dillahi yu'tihim anyasha. Wa'allahu ala fadlil azeem

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,980
I'll tell you something brief about surat al-hadid 57. This is 62. That's surah number 57

47
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Allah there talks about how

48
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,660
Nations that came the people of the book the Jews and the Christians are so

49
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:40,740
Confident that you have nothing that your book and your prophet is nothing and

50
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,220
They have dismissed it because they don't think it's possible that the Umayyid these Arabs

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
They're gonna have a prophet come on

52
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,020
Why would they be blessed? What do they have?

53
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:58,180
You know, they couldn't accept that someone from that lower nation could be blessed

54
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,940
Because of that they will never even give it time to think about the word of Allah that you've been given

55
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,180
They won't even consider it. It's not even on their radar

56
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:16,660
And when it's not on their radar Allah says one of the punishments of those arrogant people is they don't even get to know

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:24,260
That they no longer control or they have never have any control over the favor of Allah and he gives his favor to whoever he wants

58
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,740
At the mufasirun said the favor of Allah here is the Quran

59
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
They don't even know what they're missing

60
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,380
They have no idea and Allah says part of the goal is they won't even get the arrogant one amongst them

61
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,060
They will not even get to know they won't even know what they're missing and that's a punishment on them

62
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,780
The ones among them that are curious Allah will expose them to it and he describes that in other places

63
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,860
But this is among them the ones that are very you know, yes, they have a sense of supremacy and

64
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,380
What has been given to Muhammad Salli Shallam is inferior. It's less than what they have

65
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,460
So they'll never consider it Allah says yeah, you won't consider it and I will no longer let you consider it because of your attitude

66
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,700
So that's the fadr of Allah that they're missing out now look at what Allah says about his father

67
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,300
He says you have to follow the Rahmatih I don't believe this in the Quran he

68
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,420
He especially chooses with his love and care whoever he wants

69
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,860
Well, I will do for the Azeem and Allah owns the ultimate father

70
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,380
You do you know may yasha'u fee rahmatihi he brings into his father whoever he wants

71
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,260
What volume you know I had that home I'd a ban Aadima now

72
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,380
This idea that this prophet is not just for the errors

73
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,340
He's actually for all of humanity and the doors have been opened for all of humanity a couple of times in the Quran

74
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,980
Allah says this about his prophet so by Allah, I'm saying I'm gonna

75
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,340
I

76
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,160
Didn't send you except as a Rahma for all nations in all peoples

77
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,780
An important thing and another one when I saw that I'd like a fat and the nasi basheer and when I did I we didn't send you except as a

78
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,580
Except for all of people

79
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,220
To give good news and to give one warning well, I can not for a Nasi la alamoon most people have no idea

80
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,900
Oh the thing I want you guys to hear especially the younger students here the younger college students and young men and women

81
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
That are here. I want you to understand something

82
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,520
Islam became global Islam was meant to be global

83
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
not Arab culture

84
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,220
Arab culture is Arab culture and

85
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,180
Allah created Indonesian culture and Allah also allowed for Sri lankan culture to develop an

86
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:38,460
Indian culture to develop an African cultures to develop Islam did not come so everyone around the world

87
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
wears throbs and

88
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,220
Everyone says hey, what are people in Saudi are wearing? Let me copy that because I want to be more Islamic

89
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,380
That's not why Islam came

90
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,460
It's not did that come for that reason

91
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,220
The you know we developed this idea that the more you look like an Arab

92
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,140
It's but not even every Arab the more you look like an Arab from the Gulf

93
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,380
The more Islamic you are I

94
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,060
Don't know where you got this idea from but it's definitely not the Quran

95
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,540
The Sahaba themselves they went to Rome

96
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,980
Arab Sahaba went to Rome and put on Roman clothes

97
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,620
They did that well I gave guidelines on how you should dress

98
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,860
But not what you should wear how you should wear

99
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,580
How you should wear?

100
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,780
You and this this idea it makes me sad sometimes because you know sometimes you be you beat young men

101
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,580
That don't know any Arabic

102
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,340
They don't know much about their Dean, but they're rocking like the most Khalid you you're you're from Kosovo, bro

103
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Why are you wearing that?

104
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,980
As-Salamu Alaikum wa rahmatullahi yaa Akhi

105
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,060
I was like, why are you Kosovo?

106
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,140
No, no, no, that's all I know. I just want to sound like

107
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,540
Well, you could just say bro you could you don't say yaa he's not more Islamic than bro

108
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,500
So, okay

109
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,180
It's good

110
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,180
So we we became a

111
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,020
You know the idea that somehow copying

112
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,740
Arab culture makes you more religious or somehow that's a superior culture is actually what Islam came to end

113
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,660
Allah says they began as what I don't mean

114
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Right now the alien

115
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,860
There were a culture with no heritage and Allah decided to elevate them and by result

116
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,820
He's decided to elevate other nations, but then here's the tragedy

117
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,780
Who was being taught a lesson in these ayat? I've showed you now who was being taught a lesson who thought they were better

118
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,980
These realites so I'm doing that we learned that lesson now. No Pakistani thinks that they're better than Bangladesh's

119
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,700
Hamdolillah

120
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,220
No, Indonesian thinks they're better than the Malaysians or the Malays think that the Malay Malays think they're better than the Indian Malays

121
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,340
They don't think that ever again

122
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,860
The Albanians and the Kosovans equal in every way

123
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,220
I mean the Algerians Moroccans and Tunisians best friends

124
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,660
Nobody thinks they're better than anybody else. You know

125
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,340
The the Qataris and the Saudis

126
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
You know everybody gets along

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,200
We don't think anybody is less than us or more than us, but you know Muslims in Muslims in India and Muslims in Pakistan

128
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,140
best friends

129
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,740
forever

130
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,300
right

131
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,020
The whole point of this was now humanity will see themselves

132
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,500
They will see a people that come from different cultures different backgrounds different clothes

133
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,660
Different food different language, but one thing unites them and makes them equal like nothing else and that's their Islam

134
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,340
and

135
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,340
if we don't hold on to that and

136
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,780
We said and by the way that doesn't mean we should all dress the same way or look the same way or talk the same way

137
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,220
Allah's design was diversity that was his design

138
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,100
but when we start

139
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,060
Celebrating our culture our heritage as somehow superior to somebody else's and

140
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,020
Then what we did is it wasn't enough that this was happening in our home or it was happening in our country

141
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,620
We wanted to bring that into our musket the Allah's house

142
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,300
Allah's house

143
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,900
So now you can have a musket in in certain countries

144
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,220
You can have a musket where it could be that there's a one community there the majority that neighborhood, right?

145
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,700
So you go to Steinway Street. There's a lot of you know Moroccans inside

146
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,160
There's a Moroccan musket you consider the Moroccan musket, but other people go there too

147
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,060
Right, it's just it's a lot of house

148
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,360
But now when what starts happening in some places is when other people go there they look at them

149
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,260
But other that's not how you pray

150
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,100
They won't talk like that to one of their own, but they'll talk like that when there's a foreigner

151
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,060
Or somebody else

152
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:55,600
They'll do that. So one one thing that became is certain races started becoming uncomfortable with certain other races

153
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,940
But then there's another kind of father

154
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,300
The Israelites developed the idea that the ones among them who have knowledge are better than the ones among them who don't have knowledge

155
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,580
The knowledgeable ones are better than the ones who don't have knowledge and then they had strong disagreements with each other

156
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,300
So what did alhamdulillah Muslims never do?

157
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,780
If you walk into a musket and you don't look like you don't pray like everybody else in that much of this brain

158
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,860
Your beard does not fit the uniform beard standard for that musket or

159
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,140
You know we start

160
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,940
Hmm this guy huh I see

161
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,620
Unfortunately he's going to help

162
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,620
Because he's not wearing the he's not wearing the gender uniform

163
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,540
Clearly nobody gave him the memo

164
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,500
This idea of the sense of superiority over others

165
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,500
afflicted this umma and

166
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,620
This is the exact thing. Oh, I'm telling you Allah pointed out that the Israelites had this mentality and

167
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:02,580
Allah corrected that mentality and gave this this dean to the entire world and now each one of us became many Israelites

168
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,660
That's just that's the sad thing. I mean it hurts me to say that

169
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,620
But we have to you can't fix something if you don't identify the problem

170
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,060
There's a hadith of the Prophet's life of a lot men mirror at all women

171
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,460
The believer is a mirror of the believer if there's a stain on here

172
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:23,300
The mirror will so there's a stain and the stain that I see then hurts me is that we became either nationalistic

173
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,340
Tribal we became extremely tribal or

174
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,340
We became extremely arrogant in terms of our own religious understanding. I

175
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,540
Learned from my sheikh. This is the hub which means that all of you are but the heads

176
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,620
You know that all of you are wrong none of you can be right

177
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:48,260
This kind of like us versus them me versus everyone else this kind of mentality is what Islam came to eradicate

178
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,780
It and just think about early Islam for a moment

179
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:58,500
Just sometimes you should just stop and think about early Islam and you're you'll be amazed

180
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,900
When the soul of Allah, so long as I'm gave his final speech

181
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,780
And he said for you but the rest of the ride the ones who are here should spread to the ones who are not here

182
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
How many people were in front of him thousands?

183
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,060
Are they all the same level of knowledge the thousands of people? What do you think?

184
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,900
Same or no

185
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,580
Some people know more some people know less

186
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,580
Do we say by the way when you set spend it to share with someone else make sure you bring them back

187
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,100
So they learn from the pop proper highest knowledgeable people and then only and only otherwise don't share anything

188
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,740
Don't say anything Islam spread organically and

189
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,500
Islam somebody knew two suras they went and shared what?

190
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,980
two suras

191
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,060
Somebody knew the entire Quran they share the entire Quran

192
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,980
Somebody knew if they knew how to pray they just taught somebody else what how to pray?

193
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:56,980
That's it. That's what I learned and they shared it and the knowledge organically started spreading and that's the early victories of Islam

194
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,980
They spread in this way. What did we do centuries later? No, no, no, no, you can't pray

195
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:09,900
No, I can't teach you how to pray. I'm not certified. I didn't get four masters degrees in how to pray. I can't tell you how to pray

196
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,660
Me teach you Fatihah. No, no, no

197
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,340
When it comes to Fatihah, I know as much as a Christian or June or atheists

198
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,860
How could I do you need to get me certified PhD to teach you how to recite the fat?

199
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
crazy people

200
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,340
This this is insane

201
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,340
This is not how Islam began

202
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,180
We took the focal of Allah and removed it people started they learned a little and then it puts pressure on me

203
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,020
If I'm gonna share with someone else I should try to learn some more and

204
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:47,060
Everybody took personal responsibility. What did we do? No, no, no, no responsibility goes only to scholars. I

205
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,820
Don't have to do anything

206
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,420
The average Muslim had to be a minimum level of educated so they can be a contributor

207
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,060
You see so they can be helpful

208
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,420
You didn't have to all become scholars

209
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,340
We didn't have to become scholars, but we didn't have to become learned and you have to find somebody you can learn from and they can

210
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,540
And then they get asked somebody comes and asked me

211
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,780
I don't have the answer now

212
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,660
I have to go learn from someone else and then share back and it wasn't about pride or ego

213
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,220
The problem is when you have one group of people that says we have all the knowledge

214
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,860
Come and ask us if you don't ask us then you're gonna get misguided then those people develop their own kind of arrogance

215
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,460
They develop their own kind of elite status which happened in previous religions

216
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,100
There needs to be a

217
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,660
Transparent connection between scholars and the people and everything in between an open transparent connection

218
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:45,180
And that was what was that's what's missing so far. Okay. Now anyway, look at the open invitation

219
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
I'll wrap this up quickly

220
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,620
So lafa'u laika ma'allatheena an'amallahu alayhim whoever would obey Allah and the messenger

221
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Whoever did Allah specify which ethnicity which nation the open invite whoever would obey Allah and the messenger

222
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:05,340
Then they are among those who Allah has blessed from among the prophets and the ones who accepted the truth and the martyrs and good people

223
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,740
What hasuna wulaika Rafiqat and what a beautiful company that is meaning if you join these people

224
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,860
You're good people

225
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:18,180
You are considered in the same group as the shohadah the siddiqun and you can even join the company of the prophets

226
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,220
You can be with them in jannah too

227
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,620
That equal for moving Allah that is the favor from Allah before a puddle again

228
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,700
That's an open invite from Allah. It's not just an invite to accept Islam. It's an invite to eventually be in the company of prophets

229
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,780
What a puddle of Allah all the heroes of our history we can join them

230
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
We can be among them

231
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Yeah, you had the name of Allah now the other side of the fadda. This is the scary side of the fadda

232
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,340
Please listen to this. I don't swear at the end of the hour. Listen to this part carefully

233
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,980
Please yeah, you had nothing I'm on those of you who claim to believe

234
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:58,140
May I tell them in come on the enemy whoever among you starts walking away from his or her religion

235
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,900
You start taking steps back from your religion

236
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,300
So so far you're coming common then Allah will bring a new nation

237
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,940
Allah will bring a new nation you have boom. What you have bought a wolf a

238
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,200
Nation who he will love and they will love him

239
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,560
Meaning Allah is saying you're taking steps back because clearly you don't love me enough

240
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,340
That's why you're taking steps back and if you don't love me enough

241
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,340
There's plenty of people that I will love and they will what?

242
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,820
They'll love me back and

243
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,260
If you if you want to take steps back, that's fine. That's your choice

244
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,480
But the word the invitation is open to the entire world. You're not a special race

245
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,600
That only has to be you now. It's open to the whole world. So on the one side

246
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,000
That's a good thing on the other side. It also makes us replaceable. You understand

247
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,520
It could be that the the Pakistanis the Beledishees the Egyptians the Moroccans

248
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,020
They don't uphold Allah's book and the led the sides. No, you know what? I'm gonna replace you with the Germans in a hundred years

249
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,480
They're they're all gonna be they're gonna carry my religion now

250
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,200
I'm gonna replace you with the Italians. They're gonna carry my religion. He could do that

251
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,680
He's done that before

252
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,680
He's done that before the Tatar

253
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,960
The vast majority of them who slaughtered Muslims

254
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,320
Or then basically carrying Islam for the next few centuries

255
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,000
So if I had to know Allah will replace one nation with

256
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,760
Another nation completely so if I could now be common you have a home where you have one out of the net in

257
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
Azzatina

258
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:39,040
He that describes what is it about them that I will love why will they replace you what quality will they have that clearly you don't have

259
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,920
They'll be very humble before believers and they'll be tough against enemies

260
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,460
You know what Muslims became really tough against each other very humble before enemies

261
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,560
Isn't it

262
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,560
Allah says

263
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,080
I

264
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,920
Jaheduna

265
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
They'll struggle in the path of Allah

266
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,360
And they will not be afraid of the criticism that comes from anyone who criticizes

267
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,200
They will not be people who fear criticism

268
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Now just internalize these words. How many people take steps back from Islam because they are afraid of what?

269
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
criticism

270
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,800
From the family criticism from the workplace criticism from the university criticism from people riding on the bus

271
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,880
Criticism I can't do this thing. I don't you know, unless this way

272
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,000
You want to take steps back your choice Allah will bring about new people

273
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
That he will love

274
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
And they will love him

275
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,840
I met somebody who told me they have a really hard time

276
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,000
Where they women for example to struggle with hijab for different reasons

277
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,520
I've realized that after talking to hundreds of sisters. It's not one reason there's a and I empathize one reason though is really epic

278
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
I've never heard that one before so I'll tell you

279
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,040
I just think that because I come from a country the women that wear hijab are all villagers

280
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,920
So they're uneducated. So when I see a hijabi woman, I think of an uneducated woman

281
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,640
I don't want to be associated with uneducated people. That's why I don't wear hijab. I mean, that's a new one

282
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,960
You are on I mean, that's honest enough to share with me because most people when they have that kind of an ugly opinion

283
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,080
They don't share it. They just say I just you know something in me

284
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,160
But that's pretty raw. That's that's honest. I respect it. I respect it

285
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,000
and

286
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,120
I'm like and on the flip side you have a young woman who

287
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,960
You know, where's the hijab gets rejected from college university applications gets reserved from job offers because she's wearing the hijab

288
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,680
And then doesn't Allah keeps opening

289
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,480
He closes a thousand doors and he opens a new door from in Haifu la-ihtasib from where she couldn't even imagine

290
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,520
And she gets her education gets her and she's some of the highest ranking phd's in many countries are hijabi women

291
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,240
Right and I look at that and say okay. Here's a person who says I don't want to be associated with what?

292
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,400
uneducated people and that person wasn't able to complete their education

293
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
And on the flip side

294
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,080
You got people that are ignorant villagers

295
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
the umi yin apparently

296
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
That are reaching the height of heights

297
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,200
right

298
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,000
So

299
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Allah will replace

300
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,320
He'll replace individuals. He'll replace nations

301
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,360
If that's our attitude, Allah says I don't need your attitude

302
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Take it somewhere else. Take it to tiktok

303
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,120
Okay, that's not what he says. That's what I'm saying. Okay

304
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Okay

305
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,960
Same words that is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants. Isn't that the word we're studying?

306
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,680
Here he said I've opened it up to all nations. That's the favor of Allah there. He says by the way you take steps back

307
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
I have many other nations to choose from

308
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,040
That is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants and now the words man yasha

309
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,000
Man is an innocent musul yasha is a musul and because they are both who I'm being technical

310
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,080
But that's okay. You'll get over it both who are it gives you two meanings at the same time

311
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,920
What it one gives you one meaning it gives you is that is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever Allah wants

312
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,960
The other meaning is that is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever actually wants it

313
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,440
I'll say that again. That is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever

314
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Actually wants it

315
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,040
So the you don't get to say oh, he chooses whoever he wants what what can I do?

316
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,800
No, you didn't want it because if you want that there's no way he won't give it to you

317
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,200
There's no way he won't give it to you subhanallah. Yeah, there's um

318
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Let me just see oh

319
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,880
Okay, I'll hear other two done. I'm gonna finish this I want to start the next session with the next I because that's heavy

320
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,480
So I'll hear other two done. I'm gonna kiss me. I mean Allah's intention

321
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,280
Allah wants I translated Allah wants. Yeah

322
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,040
Uh, the warrant in Arabic these two words Sha'a and Arada

323
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Sha'a and Arada. So the irada of Allah is the intent of Allah and the mashia of Allah is also the intent of Allah

324
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
But what's the difference between them?

325
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,240
I want you to it's a subtle Quran thing because you know in translation you'll just see Allah wants

326
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
But I want you to know the difference between them. Yeah

327
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
So the word Shah comes from Shay

328
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,600
Shay you know what Shay means in Arabic? Allah who Allah kundi Shay in qadir

329
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
I think something solid

330
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,880
When Allah has decided something and it's set it's solid then you see what word

331
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,360
Shah

332
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,080
If you see irada, you'll see Allah wants something but it will depend on you

333
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,960
For example, Allah will say you need a lot with you. Huff if I go

334
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Allah wants by teaching you the laws Allah wants to make your life lighter

335
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Allah wants to make your life what?

336
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,720
Lighter but whether your life becomes lighter or not depends on who?

337
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Depends on you because if you don't follow the laws your life will not become

338
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Lighter, but if Allah has the mashia

339
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
If he does Shah Allah

340
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,040
That means whether you apply it or not your life will definitely become

341
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Lighters guarantees it's done. It's solidified

342
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,560
But irada means Allah has made the intent

343
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,320
But now it's up to you whether you want that intent to be fulfilled

344
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,960
You need to Allah who do you obey in a vacuum Allah wants to make things clear for you

345
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,320
Allah says Allah wants to make things clear for you. Is there a part of that that depends on you?

346
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,880
It does isn't it you have to go learn you have to seek that clarity you need to Allah who do you obey in a

347
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,240
If you don't do your part that it will not become what?

348
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Clear if that was the mashia of Allah

349
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,360
Whether you tried or not everybody would have clarity without any attempt at themselves

350
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,720
So that's the difference between Shah and irada and here guys you're distracting everybody

351
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,720
It's okay. What happened nothing happened. This is nothing

352
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,080
Three people I would have tolerated four or five and everybody's like what are they talking?

353
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,720
God this is this is the tragedy of education

354
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,240
I don't get tired of telling the same jokes as you may have already known

355
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
So I'll tell you the same old joke

356
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,760
It's not a joke. It's actually I it's my jokes are actually my trauma is what it is

357
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Okay

358
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,000
I made the mistake of teaching an Arabic program Arabic class

359
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,040
In a classroom where imagine my class by my podium was there and behind me was a giant window

360
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
And my students are looking at me and they're also

361
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,680
Looking out the window and behind the window in the distance. There was a highway

362
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
cars

363
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,880
I kid you not my students I could look at their face and tell if there's traffic

364
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
When there's traffic they're doing this

365
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,120
What there's no traffic to do

366
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,120
One of my students really likes trucks I can tell us there's a truck on the highway. He's looking at me. Look at me or there he goes

367
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,600
When you're in a lecture everything other than the lecture becomes interesting

368
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,800
Poor belayin comes and talks to us man about some issue and you're all like

369
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,400
What are they?

370
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,880
I want to know I want to know what they're talking about

371
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,240
If this was not a lecture you would not care

372
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,480
That would not be important to you. But it's because it's a lecture

373
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,680
This becomes you guys know this in Jumaah Khutbah. Jumaah Khutbah

374
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,360
Is you know, it's mashallah. So some of you you hear in

375
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
the

376
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,320
I like that's in between your ashab al kahab, right? That's that's Friday. So it makes sense. So

377
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,360
But what do people do they're like now who's gonna walk in?

378
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,840
And this musket is especially challenging because the carpet is very simple

379
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,840
So you can't even look at the lines that would go like this and that and make up your own faces in it, you know

380
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
So

381
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,200
That is the favor of Allah

382
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,600
He gives it to whoever he decides to give it to and whoever makes the firm decision to get it

383
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,600
Sha'a strong decision will solid will and Allah possesses the ultimate favor

384
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,440
Many mufasir would have commented over and over again that the fadal of Allah is also referring to the Quran

385
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,600
Allah possesses the ultimate favor. That is that the favor of Allah is the Quran

386
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,680
Abba aza fi al ummiyina rasul an

387
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,440
Rasul himself is on Quran and yamshi the Quran walking around is the prophet

388
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,520
Salallahu alayhi wa sallam, right? So all of it boils down to the word of Allah

389
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,720
And that is the favor of Allah that they're missing out on

390
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Salamu alaykum everyone

391
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,320
There are almost 50 000 students around the world that are interested on top of the students

392
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,440
We have in studying the Quran and its meanings and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends

393
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,040
And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive. So if you can help sponsor students on bayna tv

394
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,880
Please do so and visit our sponsorship page

395
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,440
I appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives our mission success and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran

396
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
And the beauty of it the world over
