0	3260	The reason I'm telling you all of this is nowadays we hear a lot of
3920	9620	People say oh you have to follow the Quran and the Sunnah and what they mean by Sunnah is Google whether there's a hadith or not
10560	12560	Right, that's not Sunnah
12720	21120	That's a hadith and to understand how that hadith was applied so that you understand the Sunnah is the next step
21880	26880	You can't just look at a hadith and say now I know exactly what to do. You understand
30160	35120	So before we talk about the change in sequence
35120	36120	Bismillahirrahmanirrahim
36120	37120	Wa-A'la wa-Sallam wa-A'la wa-Sallim
37120	38120	Wa-A'la al-Alihi wa-Sallim
38120	42000	Before we talk about the change in sequence with Ibrahim, there's two more things
42000	46800	I wanted to talk to you about in regards to the book and the wisdom that I didn't talk about in the last session
46920	51640	So I'm going to quickly mention them now one way you can look at wisdom is
52120	56880	Actually the way Allah describes wisdom in different places in the Quran if you take a look at that
56880	63120	You'll see that there's a difference between what you can call laws and on the other side morals
63480	70280	Laws and morals or morality ethics even another word for that can be ethics and the difference is important to understand
70280	72680	Allah is something that's very precise
73560	76920	Okay, like fasting begins at this time ends at this time. That's a law
77400	82640	The Salahs are at Kitab al-Muqtah. That's Allah specific in inheritance
82640	88280	Who which family member gets gets how much is a law? So laws are very specific
89040	94280	Another distinguishing factor with some laws is that laws when you break them are punishable
95040	100600	So there are laws that include punishments to right laws not every law has punishments
100600	103540	But some laws can also have punishments, right?
104640	109000	Another important factor about laws you should know is laws deal with
109680	111040	extremes
111040	118640	This is also in any society laws deal with extremes like most laws that are written in the books are not written for normal people
118640	120520	They're written for criminals
120520	127440	Right because the law of you know like controlling your speed on the highway or the laws against stealing or the laws against
127840	134400	Robbery or the laws against murder or the laws against those kinds of kidnapping and those kinds of things those laws are not written for
134560	138600	Normal people they're written for the most extreme criminal elements of society
138680	143680	So you'll find in the Quran the laws of the Quran of course deal with all of this they deal with specifics
144200	146200	they also deal with
146600	147840	You know
147840	151880	Punishments in some cases and then they also deal with very extreme situations
152440	155920	So just because you see a law in the Quran doesn't mean that that's meant for everyone
156000	160000	It's meant for very very extreme situations the craziest members of society
160400	165240	Need to have some laws on the book because you never know what human beings are capable of you understand
165440	169640	So I'll say something that's obvious as a crude example, but an important example
170040	172880	Unless it's for you but I like a little bit of a lot of you
172880	179160	Well, I thought you come on my to come like it's haram for you to marry your mothers and your aunts and your daughters and your you
179160	182140	know Allah says that but obviously it's obvious for
182760	185800	The vast majority of humanity, but some psychos are out there
186400	189840	That need to be punished if they have some sickness like that you understand
189840	197120	So the laws have to be there to prevent those kinds of extremes and to actually be able to punish those kinds of extremes if they happen
197120	198960	Anyway, so that's a little bit about laws
198960	203440	But let's talk about wisdom and I said this time wisdom you can look at it as morality, right?
203480	209200	So an example of wisdom in the Quran is what I tell chief in our demaraha walk on the earth with humility
209360	211360	Don't walk on the earth with pride
211800	215840	How do you know if somebody's walking on the earth with pride or walking on the earth with humility?
215840	217920	You can't have some Islamic police check. Hey
218440	220440	Fix your humble your walk
220840	225720	No, no, I'm not walking with swag. I have a swollen foot. That's why I'm walking like this
227200	230000	That's not my gangster walk. That's just you know, I have an injury
230720	233400	Right, you can't check if somebody's walking with pride
234040	238400	That's so one of the the first thing you should know about morality is you cannot
239280	243960	Immediately catch someone doing it or it's it's pretty much never punishable
244360	246840	You could obey the law and still be very immoral
247200	252520	You could be very unethical person. Unless it's for example, you know, don't raise your voice in surah
252520	255640	but with a passage on wisdom and let says, you know
256040	260120	Wadud bin sultekin na ankara naswati nasotul hamir lower your voice
260120	265720	The the argovious voice is the brain of a donkey the sounds made by a donkey or a mule
266360	271440	Right. So but does does that mean that if you raise your voice, you've done something hara?
271440	273200	No, you've done something
273200	274200	unethical
274200	275360	unwise
275360	280840	But you haven't necessarily done something hara so now we're learning that as far as our behavior is concerned
281480	284480	Allah expects us to act within the law and
285280	287760	Also, Allah expects us to I act wisely
288640	292840	The problem happens when a lot of people think all Islam is this halal and hara
293760	296920	Halal and hara is about the law, but it's not about what?
297960	302680	Wisdom so the only question is is this halal is this hara is this halal is this hara
302960	305440	Okay, it's not halal then it's okay. No, no, no
306160	309280	Hadad maybe halal, but they also at the same time may not be what?
310080	312720	May not be wise may not even be moral
313240	315240	That's the other side you got a check
315240	319680	Right, so that's that's another another dimension of it. Okay. It's a silly example, but like
320400	326800	Is it halal to eat peanuts? Yeah, but is it wise for you to eat peanuts if you have a peanut allergy?
328160	330160	Probably not
330320	336680	You understand so there is a distinction between morality and law so that's one quick thing the other quick comment
337280	339480	In regards to this is about hadith because you know
339880	343520	Imam Shafiq said that Hikmah can refer to the Sunnah of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam
343520	345520	So I wanted to make a quick comment about
346760	348880	Humility in understanding hadith
349720	351720	so the thing is
351960	354960	This analogy will help you if you look inside a door
355400	360840	From a keyhole like a small hole in the door and you look inside how much of the room do you see?
362360	369600	Very little but if somebody looks inside the room and sees this much and then says now I will describe the entire room to you
370440	375040	Is that a fair accurate depiction or do you have to use a lot of the imagination?
376000	382920	In a lot of imagine. Okay. Now let me ask you the question if two people are talking about like let's say me and some other young man are talking
383400	388000	And he says I have a problem with my brother, you know, he's he's this he's back
388000	394240	You know, he beats me up or whatever. I'm talking to him. I say, you know what sometimes you should fight back a little bit or something and
394880	398240	You walk by and you heard three seconds of that conversation
399320	403000	Okay, you don't know the beginning of it. You don't know the end of it. You know the middle three seconds
404400	410400	Is it accurate for you to take the convert the three-second conversation and then say you know inspired by Assad
411200	419440	I think anytime you meet your brother you should beat him up because and I have an authentic recording of him saying fight back with your brother
420400	423480	So throw a punch or two. Would that be fair of you to do?
424200	430640	No, because you're not being first of all, you're not recognizing the conversations happen sometimes inside a context and
431520	433320	outside of that context
433320	435320	You cannot use them a
435600	441840	Doctor and a patient are having a conversation the doctor says you need to eat this this this and you need to you need to avoid
441840	446480	This this and this that's specific to the patient. Yeah, but this patient is an influencer
447680	454400	So he goes after the doctor patient of what may says everyone stop eating this this this and make sure you take this medication every morning
455280	459280	This is authentically researched the base research. What wait? Hold on a second
459480	463240	You can't tell everyone to do that because that was specific prescription for who?
463960	469800	For you you understand now, let's understand what happens in many a hadith of the prophets
469800	473520	Allah, I said sometimes the prophets like them is talking to all of the Muslims
474640	477040	Which means everybody's being addressed
477800	481640	Sometimes a specific person comes to the prophets I said that says I need help
482400	487120	Help me with the situation or that situation and you'll find many a hadith with a person comes to the prophets
487120	490080	I said them and talk stand and the prophet gives him an answer
490200	496040	It's also interesting to note that different people come and say one of the genres of hadith is
496680	498920	Submarine comes and says what's the best thing that I can do?
499520	503720	Right and another person says the same question. What's the best thing that I can do another person says
503720	508000	What's the best thing that I can do and you'll find these different hadith erasions. There are different answers
508680	510680	It's not the same answer
510840	517680	If that one person who was told this is the best thing you can do goes on by the way guys the best thing you all can do is this and
518680	523600	The other guy says what do you mean? No, no, no, the best thing you can do is what the prophet told me
524240	529760	And the other one comes in no, no, no, no, which is both wrong the best thing you can do is what the prophet told me
530440	534640	Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture just before you continue
534640	539900	I want to let you know and encourage you that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com and help other sign up
539900	541900	I even sponsor students for bayinatv.com
541960	547640	So we can create worldwide communities of students that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran
547960	551120	And are in shallow tala spreading that in their own circles. Thanks so much
552560	555180	What do you think is happening when people come to the prophets?
555180	557880	I said as opposed to when the prophet is talking to everyone is there a difference
559120	561920	Because when the prophet is talking to someone who came to him
562840	568840	He it is because he's the source of wisdom in the humanity. He's first looking at who am I talking to?
569120	574000	What is their situation? What is their background? What is it that this person needs? I'm gonna give them a prescription
574960	576960	for them they need this
577800	582840	It is important for us to first understand is the prophet saying something so the law of Adam
583080	586200	That is meant for everyone or was that specific to a?
586960	588960	Person is not important
589080	592800	Now there's another piece of the puzzle the analogy I gave you is this much. Yes
593560	596760	There's a conversation happening and the prophet says something
597360	602240	And you're like, oh, there's a hadith. He said this like is this part of a larger conversation
603000	607020	Who was this conversation being had with? Did he have this conversation with other people?
607340	609460	Do we know the whole picture or do we know this much?
610180	614340	If you read that hadith of the prophet so that it might take you three seconds to read the entire hadith
614460	616460	You think the conversation was just three seconds
617220	619220	We could the conversation have been five minutes
619660	621260	Could have been ten minutes
621260	625540	Could it have been over multiple days? Is that possible? Is there a lot we don't know?
625900	632660	Yeah, so some and this is where just googling. Oh, I found a hadith in Bukhari and in Muslim
632740	639060	Or it's in Abu Maj'ud and Abu Dawud or Ibn Maj'ah and therefore that we should do all we should all do this hold on a second
639820	642420	You're thinking that the moment you find the letter
643300	648660	You know the moment you find the letter you've got it figured out the Muslims historically never did this
648820	651180	This is a new phenomenon in the last century
651740	657380	For the religions been around a long time and nobody simply just took a head the defense said this is what we're all gonna do
658140	661860	Nobody was doing this but because we have now it's the age of information
662340	669100	We have access to the glimpse of the conversation of the Prophet's life. So now this is the difference between the hadith
669300	671300	Narration and the faqih
671300	677620	What is the faqih do the faqih says the Prophet said this alaihi sato srahm, but let's find out who he said it to
678180	681700	Let's find out when he said it. Let's find out where he said it
681860	688140	Let's understand the larger context because without it we might come to the wrong conclusion. Is that possible?
688820	692540	Yeah, it's very possible. It's very possible. You might come to the wrong conclusion
692540	698240	It's also very possible that he was dealing with a very specific case and you pretend that you're dealing with this is about
698860	702500	Everyone the reason I'm telling you all of this is nowadays. We hear a lot of
703140	708840	People say oh you have to follow the Quran and the Sunnah and what they mean by Sunnah is Google whether there's a hadith or not
709780	711900	Right, that's not Sunnah
711980	720340	That's a hadith and to understand how that hadith was applied so that you understand the Sunnah is the next step
721100	724760	You can't just look at a hadith and say now I know exactly what to do
725140	729820	You understand and there are other issues too like if the Prophet's life is something
730260	733500	then of course the Sahaba are the ones that are listening and
734620	738340	If they like I'll give you a silly example even though I'm not a fifth person
738340	743380	But I discussed fifth with scholars and colleagues and things the results I said it says who are full yet? Yeah
743780	748740	Grow the beard. He says grow the beard. Okay, so shall I okay fine grow the beard
749180	752500	That's what the results that I saw to set up. What how much should I grow it?
752900	758900	When should I cut it? How much should I cut the mustache? What's the length of it? These are technical questions, right?
759340	764860	Well, one way you can go about it is you could say I found one Sahabi who had this much beard or I won't found one
765260	769300	But then you might take Imam Malik's approach is let's look at how people in Medina
769620	774060	Have their beards because they're the people that lived inspired by the Prophet's life so I'm in the first generation
774260	777820	Or even Abu Hadifa might say there are hundreds of Sahaba that live in Kufa
778140	782540	because Adi radiAllahu anhu made the capital of Islam Kufa in Baghdad
783140	789260	Right and there's hundreds of companions that live there. Let's look at their beers before we decide to set a rule on how long
789260	794380	Beers should be that's pretty logical because the Sahaba wouldn't be disobeying the messenger's life
794740	800340	But if you don't know that background because this is the foqa discussing it you don't know that background you just say hey
800340	803700	There's a hadith it says grow. It didn't say stop growing
804500	806500	Keep on going bro
806620	811540	Just keep on growing and cut it didn't say when to stop cutting so you keep on cutting
812780	818960	Right that's a to me. That's a problem to me. That's an issue because it's not just about citing
818960	822260	Oh, where'd you get the words you the Neil brother the the Neil bros?
823060	828220	Okay, but the thing with the deal approach is we're not looking at the actual context
828220	830100	Which is how do you find a picma?
830100	836680	This is this is against wisdom and this is wisdom that the early Muslims had and this is something that you should become more humble to like
836680	841720	When somebody sites that when somebody tells me a deep of the province I said up my first reaction is I don't know yet
842300	844460	That's honestly my first react. I need to know more
845420	848940	Where did this come from? How was this understood? What others?
848940	853020	You know and narrations are around this. What is the background to this? Who are the people involved?
853020	856260	Let me get a little bit more than this before I say I know
856980	858100	because
858100	861660	Knowing this much and claiming this much is arrogance in my opinion
862140	866040	That's just my personal personal take on what is what goes against wisdom?
866040	869100	No souls I said I was taught the law and he was taught the wisdom now
869100	873260	Let's answer this question about Ibrahim alaih said up thousands of years ago. He brought him
873300	879340	Aslam asked the question he made dua to Allah this wise do I send a messenger among my children for through
879340	881420	Ismaa a messenger and
881420	884500	Thousands of years later from the line of Ismaa a.s. Salam comes
884900	889340	And so does Allah so Allah alaih was Salam on the other side of Rahim alaih salam and is haq
889780	891780	His haq is a prophet alaih salam
892820	898840	Ishaq alaih salam gives birth in his family. There's Yaqub. Who's a prophet Yaqub has a child named
899400	902180	You some who's a prophet and the soul says him tells us
902180	906520	Kullaba had a kind of a baby you'll cut off a baby you every time a prophet died another one took their place
906960	912520	Among the Israelites so their side the is haq part of the Ibrahim's family
913040	917160	Prophet Prophet Prophet Prophet Prophet brought every sign until Jesus
917800	921960	Until Aisa and even when Aisa was there another prophet was there with him. Yeah, yeah
922480	924160	So they were there together
924160	928560	They were two at the same time or even Musa wasn't alone. Musa was with who?
929040	934400	How long are they salam and there were other you know if two from the Israelites dimension the ones mentioned in Ya see
934400	940200	There were three messengers at the same time so as does that be 30 thin even three messengers at the same time so that happened now
940960	946520	On the Ismaa inside Allah says based the Ibrahim a.s. I'm asked for how many messengers?
946520	950480	Well, but I will be him Rasul one messenger so it's my
951760	953760	thousands of years and
954520	956520	then
956800	958800	We're supposed to last all of us
959160	963540	But from the line of his haq when Musa a.s. I was giving the book
963540	970200	I read the passage to you from so far now off Allah told Musa a.s. And the 70 leaders look out for a Nabi
971200	972120	Umi
972120	977080	The be a Nabi Umi and they and this is important in soot al-baqara is soot al-baqara
977360	980800	Allah says that Ibrahim a.s. I'm gathered all of his children
981680	985640	Yaqub a.s. I'm gathered all of his children by the way another name of Yaqub is Israel
985840	988320	This is really important another name of Yaqub is what?
988920	992160	Islaeem so when he gathered his children these were the children of
993320	996560	Islaeem literally, but he's right the children of Israel
997280	1002160	When he was dying he said who will you worship and what will you worship after I'm God?
1002160	1004160	La ta'buduna bin ba'di soot al-baqara
1004720	1010080	Here's what they said now. We'll do it a haka way that haka abaika Ibrahim a was ma'ida was haka
1010400	1014640	We will worship your God and the God of your of your father's Ibrahim and
1015920	1017600	Isma'eem and
1017600	1020640	Ishaq who did they acknowledge as one of their fathers?
1022000	1023680	Isma'eem
1023680	1025680	Isma'eem later Israelites
1026000	1030200	Dismiss Isma'eem he's from the cursed line. He's not really a son and all of that
1030400	1032400	But when Yaqub when Israeem himself
1032720	1036520	Aleyhis Salam was dying and he asked them what will you worship after I'm gone?
1036680	1042680	They referred to Isma'eem before they even referred to Ishaq because he's their older uncle
1042680	1045720	He's older than their dad so they went in age order
1046240	1048240	Ibrahim Isma'eem and then
1048240	1053440	Ishaq and from the line of Isma'eem eventually comes Rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam
1053440	1057120	This is why the Quran says they know they know him like they know their own children
1058000	1063000	They know him like they know their own children and they know the Kaaba like to know their own children because if you how can you know?
1063000	1065720	Ibrahim aleyhis salam and not know the Kaaba. How does that make any sense and?
1067760	1072040	Isma'eem aleyhis salam and Ibrahim aleyhis salam built the Kaaba and after that is haq is born
1072520	1074520	This haq is younger. He's born afterwards
1074520	1079400	How is this haq being raised by Ibrahim aleyhis salam not learning about the Kaaba does that make any sense?
1080080	1085120	The house that Allah made him build after passing all the tests and his haq doesn't know about the Kaaba that makes no sense
1086160	1087800	So they know
1087800	1093560	Now this dua that he was making he said to Allah. Ya Allah these children my child is a prophet and
1094360	1097880	My other child is the Allah has promised him prophecy on that side
1097960	1101560	So he's assuming that his children are going to be pure
1102640	1106880	All they need is when they hear the ayaat of Allah, they'll be ready to act on them
1107320	1113480	The moment they get exposed to the ayaat of Allah because who is Ibrahim aleyhis salam if qala la hu rabbuhu aslam qala
1114200	1117480	Aslam to me my beloved whenever Allah said to him surrender. What did he do?
1118040	1120560	He surrendered immediately and what did he learn from his child?
1120560	1123760	He told his child in the arafil manami and the adhbhuhaqa
1123760	1127480	I see in my dream that I'm slaughtering you. What did his son say? Hold on dad
1128400	1132640	What is the sense if I'm a tuba yama tiffa I'm a tuba dad do whatever you're being told
1132640	1136960	He's exactly like his dad whenever he hears the word of Allah. He immediately what?
1137880	1141960	Obesity so in his mind when you hear the ayaat of Allah
1142040	1147160	Then you're ready to learn what Allah tells you to do and you'll do it you add me move on kitaba well
1147760	1156400	Hikmah and yes over time we should make sure that we remain cleansed cleansing was not a prerequisite for obedience in his experience
1157120	1163160	Because he's he's got these pure kids. He's got himself. He's pure of heart and his child is pure of heart
1164120	1170440	So he makes the dua from the best way he could think from the human perspective Allah answered his door
1171440	1173440	But Allah answered his door
1174080	1176080	By perfecting his door
1176840	1183360	The human being asks to the best of their ability and Allah takes as he takes every element of his prayer and answers it
1183560	1185560	But perfects it
1185560	1187360	He says don't you ask for the right things?
1187360	1191960	But I'm going to give you the right order of things that only Allah could have known and which is yet
1191960	1195880	Lou Aleyhi my a tida we come out on that we can listen to me come you're so dumb you have to do I'll make my
1195880	1199240	Attida we use a key cool when you add them to the kitaba with him
1199240	1202680	All of these ayaat connect with the IE we're studying for example
1202680	1206680	I'll a Ziz al-Hakeem in sort of a carat connects with sort of a juma doesn't it and
1207240	1211840	Then in the next I Allah says where you only move common the second I aka I a 151
1211840	1216760	He ends the I a by saying where you I'm the mocomma. I don't take will tell them when he teaches you what you couldn't have known
1217600	1220360	Well, you couldn't have known because you were ummi in and
1221200	1223200	I mean is mentioned where?
1223240	1228680	So to do my this is connecting to that too and then in the last one look at man
1228680	1232080	Allah who I don't mean in Allah has done a huge favor to the believers
1232600	1237480	When he appointed a messenger among them so in other Imran he before he mentions these four steps
1237480	1239480	He mentions that Allah has done them a huge favor
1240040	1245040	Guess what's coming in the next time two aisles later in sort of a little juma that I think I follow
1245040	1247320	Allah you teach me in shot that is the favor of Allah
1247320	1254800	He gives it to whoever he wants so I did run bakara 151 bakara 129 all tie into sort of juma
1254800	1260800	And one way or the other the aya that we're learning from and so we conclude this with where in Kadovin
1260800	1263920	Come to the field of the movie even though they had been clearly
1264640	1267240	Clearly lost now Allah is going to now
1267760	1275800	In the next I open up the future plan of the Oma and that's where I'm really excited to discuss with you guys tomorrow
1275800	1279720	Inshallah was not only will be finished the first section of the Sunnah tomorrow

1288280	1292920	And then we will get an overview and begin the the parable portion of the surah
