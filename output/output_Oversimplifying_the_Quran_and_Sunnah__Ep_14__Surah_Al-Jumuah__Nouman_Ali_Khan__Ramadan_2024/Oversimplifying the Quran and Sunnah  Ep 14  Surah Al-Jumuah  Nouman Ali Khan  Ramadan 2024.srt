1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
The reason I'm telling you all of this is nowadays we hear a lot of

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,620
People say oh you have to follow the Quran and the Sunnah and what they mean by Sunnah is Google whether there's a hadith or not

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,560
Right, that's not Sunnah

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:21,120
That's a hadith and to understand how that hadith was applied so that you understand the Sunnah is the next step

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,880
You can't just look at a hadith and say now I know exactly what to do. You understand

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,120
So before we talk about the change in sequence

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Wa-A'la wa-Sallam wa-A'la wa-Sallim

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
Wa-A'la al-Alihi wa-Sallim

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,000
Before we talk about the change in sequence with Ibrahim, there's two more things

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,800
I wanted to talk to you about in regards to the book and the wisdom that I didn't talk about in the last session

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,640
So I'm going to quickly mention them now one way you can look at wisdom is

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,880
Actually the way Allah describes wisdom in different places in the Quran if you take a look at that

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,120
You'll see that there's a difference between what you can call laws and on the other side morals

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,280
Laws and morals or morality ethics even another word for that can be ethics and the difference is important to understand

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,680
Allah is something that's very precise

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,920
Okay, like fasting begins at this time ends at this time. That's a law

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,640
The Salahs are at Kitab al-Muqtah. That's Allah specific in inheritance

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,280
Who which family member gets gets how much is a law? So laws are very specific

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,280
Another distinguishing factor with some laws is that laws when you break them are punishable

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,600
So there are laws that include punishments to right laws not every law has punishments

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,540
But some laws can also have punishments, right?

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,000
Another important factor about laws you should know is laws deal with

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,040
extremes

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,640
This is also in any society laws deal with extremes like most laws that are written in the books are not written for normal people

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,520
They're written for criminals

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,440
Right because the law of you know like controlling your speed on the highway or the laws against stealing or the laws against

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,400
Robbery or the laws against murder or the laws against those kinds of kidnapping and those kinds of things those laws are not written for

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,600
Normal people they're written for the most extreme criminal elements of society

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,680
So you'll find in the Quran the laws of the Quran of course deal with all of this they deal with specifics

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
they also deal with

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,840
You know

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,880
Punishments in some cases and then they also deal with very extreme situations

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,920
So just because you see a law in the Quran doesn't mean that that's meant for everyone

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's meant for very very extreme situations the craziest members of society

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Need to have some laws on the book because you never know what human beings are capable of you understand

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,640
So I'll say something that's obvious as a crude example, but an important example

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,880
Unless it's for you but I like a little bit of a lot of you

39
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,160
Well, I thought you come on my to come like it's haram for you to marry your mothers and your aunts and your daughters and your you

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,140
know Allah says that but obviously it's obvious for

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,800
The vast majority of humanity, but some psychos are out there

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,840
That need to be punished if they have some sickness like that you understand

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,120
So the laws have to be there to prevent those kinds of extremes and to actually be able to punish those kinds of extremes if they happen

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,960
Anyway, so that's a little bit about laws

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,440
But let's talk about wisdom and I said this time wisdom you can look at it as morality, right?

46
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,200
So an example of wisdom in the Quran is what I tell chief in our demaraha walk on the earth with humility

47
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Don't walk on the earth with pride

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,840
How do you know if somebody's walking on the earth with pride or walking on the earth with humility?

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
You can't have some Islamic police check. Hey

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Fix your humble your walk

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,720
No, no, I'm not walking with swag. I have a swollen foot. That's why I'm walking like this

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,000
That's not my gangster walk. That's just you know, I have an injury

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,400
Right, you can't check if somebody's walking with pride

54
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,400
That's so one of the the first thing you should know about morality is you cannot

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,960
Immediately catch someone doing it or it's it's pretty much never punishable

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,840
You could obey the law and still be very immoral

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,520
You could be very unethical person. Unless it's for example, you know, don't raise your voice in surah

58
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,640
but with a passage on wisdom and let says, you know

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,120
Wadud bin sultekin na ankara naswati nasotul hamir lower your voice

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,720
The the argovious voice is the brain of a donkey the sounds made by a donkey or a mule

61
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,440
Right. So but does does that mean that if you raise your voice, you've done something hara?

62
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,200
No, you've done something

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
unethical

64
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,360
unwise

65
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,840
But you haven't necessarily done something hara so now we're learning that as far as our behavior is concerned

66
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Allah expects us to act within the law and

67
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,760
Also, Allah expects us to I act wisely

68
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,840
The problem happens when a lot of people think all Islam is this halal and hara

69
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,920
Halal and hara is about the law, but it's not about what?

70
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,680
Wisdom so the only question is is this halal is this hara is this halal is this hara

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,440
Okay, it's not halal then it's okay. No, no, no

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,280
Hadad maybe halal, but they also at the same time may not be what?

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,720
May not be wise may not even be moral

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
That's the other side you got a check

75
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,680
Right, so that's that's another another dimension of it. Okay. It's a silly example, but like

76
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,800
Is it halal to eat peanuts? Yeah, but is it wise for you to eat peanuts if you have a peanut allergy?

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Probably not

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,680
You understand so there is a distinction between morality and law so that's one quick thing the other quick comment

79
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,480
In regards to this is about hadith because you know

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,520
Imam Shafiq said that Hikmah can refer to the Sunnah of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam

81
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
So I wanted to make a quick comment about

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,880
Humility in understanding hadith

83
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
so the thing is

84
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,960
This analogy will help you if you look inside a door

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,840
From a keyhole like a small hole in the door and you look inside how much of the room do you see?

86
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,600
Very little but if somebody looks inside the room and sees this much and then says now I will describe the entire room to you

87
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,040
Is that a fair accurate depiction or do you have to use a lot of the imagination?

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,920
In a lot of imagine. Okay. Now let me ask you the question if two people are talking about like let's say me and some other young man are talking

89
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,000
And he says I have a problem with my brother, you know, he's he's this he's back

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,240
You know, he beats me up or whatever. I'm talking to him. I say, you know what sometimes you should fight back a little bit or something and

91
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,240
You walk by and you heard three seconds of that conversation

92
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay, you don't know the beginning of it. You don't know the end of it. You know the middle three seconds

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Is it accurate for you to take the convert the three-second conversation and then say you know inspired by Assad

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:59,440
I think anytime you meet your brother you should beat him up because and I have an authentic recording of him saying fight back with your brother

95
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,480
So throw a punch or two. Would that be fair of you to do?

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,640
No, because you're not being first of all, you're not recognizing the conversations happen sometimes inside a context and

97
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,320
outside of that context

98
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
You cannot use them a

99
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,840
Doctor and a patient are having a conversation the doctor says you need to eat this this this and you need to you need to avoid

100
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,480
This this and this that's specific to the patient. Yeah, but this patient is an influencer

101
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,400
So he goes after the doctor patient of what may says everyone stop eating this this this and make sure you take this medication every morning

102
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
This is authentically researched the base research. What wait? Hold on a second

103
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,240
You can't tell everyone to do that because that was specific prescription for who?

104
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,800
For you you understand now, let's understand what happens in many a hadith of the prophets

105
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,520
Allah, I said sometimes the prophets like them is talking to all of the Muslims

106
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,040
Which means everybody's being addressed

107
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,640
Sometimes a specific person comes to the prophets I said that says I need help

108
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,120
Help me with the situation or that situation and you'll find many a hadith with a person comes to the prophets

109
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,080
I said them and talk stand and the prophet gives him an answer

110
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,040
It's also interesting to note that different people come and say one of the genres of hadith is

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,920
Submarine comes and says what's the best thing that I can do?

112
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,720
Right and another person says the same question. What's the best thing that I can do another person says

113
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,000
What's the best thing that I can do and you'll find these different hadith erasions. There are different answers

114
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
It's not the same answer

115
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,680
If that one person who was told this is the best thing you can do goes on by the way guys the best thing you all can do is this and

116
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,600
The other guy says what do you mean? No, no, no, the best thing you can do is what the prophet told me

117
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,760
And the other one comes in no, no, no, no, which is both wrong the best thing you can do is what the prophet told me

118
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,640
Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture just before you continue

119
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,900
I want to let you know and encourage you that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com and help other sign up

120
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
I even sponsor students for bayinatv.com

121
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,640
So we can create worldwide communities of students that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran

122
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,120
And are in shallow tala spreading that in their own circles. Thanks so much

123
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,180
What do you think is happening when people come to the prophets?

124
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,880
I said as opposed to when the prophet is talking to everyone is there a difference

125
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,920
Because when the prophet is talking to someone who came to him

126
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,840
He it is because he's the source of wisdom in the humanity. He's first looking at who am I talking to?

127
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,000
What is their situation? What is their background? What is it that this person needs? I'm gonna give them a prescription

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
for them they need this

129
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,840
It is important for us to first understand is the prophet saying something so the law of Adam

130
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,200
That is meant for everyone or was that specific to a?

131
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Person is not important

132
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,800
Now there's another piece of the puzzle the analogy I gave you is this much. Yes

133
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,760
There's a conversation happening and the prophet says something

134
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,240
And you're like, oh, there's a hadith. He said this like is this part of a larger conversation

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,020
Who was this conversation being had with? Did he have this conversation with other people?

136
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,460
Do we know the whole picture or do we know this much?

137
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,340
If you read that hadith of the prophet so that it might take you three seconds to read the entire hadith

138
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,460
You think the conversation was just three seconds

139
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,220
We could the conversation have been five minutes

140
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,260
Could have been ten minutes

141
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,540
Could it have been over multiple days? Is that possible? Is there a lot we don't know?

142
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:32,660
Yeah, so some and this is where just googling. Oh, I found a hadith in Bukhari and in Muslim

143
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,060
Or it's in Abu Maj'ud and Abu Dawud or Ibn Maj'ah and therefore that we should do all we should all do this hold on a second

144
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,420
You're thinking that the moment you find the letter

145
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,660
You know the moment you find the letter you've got it figured out the Muslims historically never did this

146
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,180
This is a new phenomenon in the last century

147
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,380
For the religions been around a long time and nobody simply just took a head the defense said this is what we're all gonna do

148
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,860
Nobody was doing this but because we have now it's the age of information

149
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:09,100
We have access to the glimpse of the conversation of the Prophet's life. So now this is the difference between the hadith

150
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Narration and the faqih

151
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,620
What is the faqih do the faqih says the Prophet said this alaihi sato srahm, but let's find out who he said it to

152
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,700
Let's find out when he said it. Let's find out where he said it

153
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,140
Let's understand the larger context because without it we might come to the wrong conclusion. Is that possible?

154
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,540
Yeah, it's very possible. It's very possible. You might come to the wrong conclusion

155
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:38,240
It's also very possible that he was dealing with a very specific case and you pretend that you're dealing with this is about

156
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,500
Everyone the reason I'm telling you all of this is nowadays. We hear a lot of

157
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,840
People say oh you have to follow the Quran and the Sunnah and what they mean by Sunnah is Google whether there's a hadith or not

158
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,900
Right, that's not Sunnah

159
00:11:51,980 --> 00:12:00,340
That's a hadith and to understand how that hadith was applied so that you understand the Sunnah is the next step

160
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,760
You can't just look at a hadith and say now I know exactly what to do

161
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,820
You understand and there are other issues too like if the Prophet's life is something

162
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,500
then of course the Sahaba are the ones that are listening and

163
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,340
If they like I'll give you a silly example even though I'm not a fifth person

164
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,380
But I discussed fifth with scholars and colleagues and things the results I said it says who are full yet? Yeah

165
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,740
Grow the beard. He says grow the beard. Okay, so shall I okay fine grow the beard

166
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,500
That's what the results that I saw to set up. What how much should I grow it?

167
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:38,900
When should I cut it? How much should I cut the mustache? What's the length of it? These are technical questions, right?

168
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,860
Well, one way you can go about it is you could say I found one Sahabi who had this much beard or I won't found one

169
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,300
But then you might take Imam Malik's approach is let's look at how people in Medina

170
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,060
Have their beards because they're the people that lived inspired by the Prophet's life so I'm in the first generation

171
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,820
Or even Abu Hadifa might say there are hundreds of Sahaba that live in Kufa

172
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,540
because Adi radiAllahu anhu made the capital of Islam Kufa in Baghdad

173
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:09,260
Right and there's hundreds of companions that live there. Let's look at their beers before we decide to set a rule on how long

174
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,380
Beers should be that's pretty logical because the Sahaba wouldn't be disobeying the messenger's life

175
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,340
But if you don't know that background because this is the foqa discussing it you don't know that background you just say hey

176
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,700
There's a hadith it says grow. It didn't say stop growing

177
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Keep on going bro

178
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,540
Just keep on growing and cut it didn't say when to stop cutting so you keep on cutting

179
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,960
Right that's a to me. That's a problem to me. That's an issue because it's not just about citing

180
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,260
Oh, where'd you get the words you the Neil brother the the Neil bros?

181
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:48,220
Okay, but the thing with the deal approach is we're not looking at the actual context

182
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,100
Which is how do you find a picma?

183
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,680
This is this is against wisdom and this is wisdom that the early Muslims had and this is something that you should become more humble to like

184
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,720
When somebody sites that when somebody tells me a deep of the province I said up my first reaction is I don't know yet

185
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,460
That's honestly my first react. I need to know more

186
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,940
Where did this come from? How was this understood? What others?

187
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,020
You know and narrations are around this. What is the background to this? Who are the people involved?

188
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,260
Let me get a little bit more than this before I say I know

189
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,100
because

190
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,660
Knowing this much and claiming this much is arrogance in my opinion

191
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,040
That's just my personal personal take on what is what goes against wisdom?

192
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,100
No souls I said I was taught the law and he was taught the wisdom now

193
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,260
Let's answer this question about Ibrahim alaih said up thousands of years ago. He brought him

194
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:39,340
Aslam asked the question he made dua to Allah this wise do I send a messenger among my children for through

195
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,420
Ismaa a messenger and

196
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,500
Thousands of years later from the line of Ismaa a.s. Salam comes

197
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,340
And so does Allah so Allah alaih was Salam on the other side of Rahim alaih salam and is haq

198
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,780
His haq is a prophet alaih salam

199
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,840
Ishaq alaih salam gives birth in his family. There's Yaqub. Who's a prophet Yaqub has a child named

200
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,180
You some who's a prophet and the soul says him tells us

201
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,520
Kullaba had a kind of a baby you'll cut off a baby you every time a prophet died another one took their place

202
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,520
Among the Israelites so their side the is haq part of the Ibrahim's family

203
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,160
Prophet Prophet Prophet Prophet Prophet brought every sign until Jesus

204
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,960
Until Aisa and even when Aisa was there another prophet was there with him. Yeah, yeah

205
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
So they were there together

206
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,560
They were two at the same time or even Musa wasn't alone. Musa was with who?

207
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,400
How long are they salam and there were other you know if two from the Israelites dimension the ones mentioned in Ya see

208
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,200
There were three messengers at the same time so as does that be 30 thin even three messengers at the same time so that happened now

209
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,520
On the Ismaa inside Allah says based the Ibrahim a.s. I'm asked for how many messengers?

210
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,480
Well, but I will be him Rasul one messenger so it's my

211
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
thousands of years and

212
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
then

213
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
We're supposed to last all of us

214
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,540
But from the line of his haq when Musa a.s. I was giving the book

215
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,200
I read the passage to you from so far now off Allah told Musa a.s. And the 70 leaders look out for a Nabi

216
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,120
Umi

217
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,080
The be a Nabi Umi and they and this is important in soot al-baqara is soot al-baqara

218
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
Allah says that Ibrahim a.s. I'm gathered all of his children

219
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,640
Yaqub a.s. I'm gathered all of his children by the way another name of Yaqub is Israel

220
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,320
This is really important another name of Yaqub is what?

221
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,160
Islaeem so when he gathered his children these were the children of

222
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,560
Islaeem literally, but he's right the children of Israel

223
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,160
When he was dying he said who will you worship and what will you worship after I'm God?

224
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
La ta'buduna bin ba'di soot al-baqara

225
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,080
Here's what they said now. We'll do it a haka way that haka abaika Ibrahim a was ma'ida was haka

226
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,640
We will worship your God and the God of your of your father's Ibrahim and

227
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,600
Isma'eem and

228
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,640
Ishaq who did they acknowledge as one of their fathers?

229
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,680
Isma'eem

230
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Isma'eem later Israelites

231
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Dismiss Isma'eem he's from the cursed line. He's not really a son and all of that

232
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
But when Yaqub when Israeem himself

233
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,520
Aleyhis Salam was dying and he asked them what will you worship after I'm gone?

234
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:22,680
They referred to Isma'eem before they even referred to Ishaq because he's their older uncle

235
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,720
He's older than their dad so they went in age order

236
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Ibrahim Isma'eem and then

237
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,440
Ishaq and from the line of Isma'eem eventually comes Rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam

238
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,120
This is why the Quran says they know they know him like they know their own children

239
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They know him like they know their own children and they know the Kaaba like to know their own children because if you how can you know?

240
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,720
Ibrahim aleyhis salam and not know the Kaaba. How does that make any sense and?

241
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,040
Isma'eem aleyhis salam and Ibrahim aleyhis salam built the Kaaba and after that is haq is born

242
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
This haq is younger. He's born afterwards

243
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,400
How is this haq being raised by Ibrahim aleyhis salam not learning about the Kaaba does that make any sense?

244
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,120
The house that Allah made him build after passing all the tests and his haq doesn't know about the Kaaba that makes no sense

245
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,800
So they know

246
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,560
Now this dua that he was making he said to Allah. Ya Allah these children my child is a prophet and

247
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,880
My other child is the Allah has promised him prophecy on that side

248
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,560
So he's assuming that his children are going to be pure

249
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,880
All they need is when they hear the ayaat of Allah, they'll be ready to act on them

250
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,480
The moment they get exposed to the ayaat of Allah because who is Ibrahim aleyhis salam if qala la hu rabbuhu aslam qala

251
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,480
Aslam to me my beloved whenever Allah said to him surrender. What did he do?

252
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,560
He surrendered immediately and what did he learn from his child?

253
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,760
He told his child in the arafil manami and the adhbhuhaqa

254
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,480
I see in my dream that I'm slaughtering you. What did his son say? Hold on dad

255
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
What is the sense if I'm a tuba yama tiffa I'm a tuba dad do whatever you're being told

256
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,960
He's exactly like his dad whenever he hears the word of Allah. He immediately what?

257
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,960
Obesity so in his mind when you hear the ayaat of Allah

258
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,160
Then you're ready to learn what Allah tells you to do and you'll do it you add me move on kitaba well

259
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:16,400
Hikmah and yes over time we should make sure that we remain cleansed cleansing was not a prerequisite for obedience in his experience

260
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,160
Because he's he's got these pure kids. He's got himself. He's pure of heart and his child is pure of heart

261
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,440
So he makes the dua from the best way he could think from the human perspective Allah answered his door

262
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
But Allah answered his door

263
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
By perfecting his door

264
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,360
The human being asks to the best of their ability and Allah takes as he takes every element of his prayer and answers it

265
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
But perfects it

266
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,360
He says don't you ask for the right things?

267
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,960
But I'm going to give you the right order of things that only Allah could have known and which is yet

268
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,880
Lou Aleyhi my a tida we come out on that we can listen to me come you're so dumb you have to do I'll make my

269
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,240
Attida we use a key cool when you add them to the kitaba with him

270
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,680
All of these ayaat connect with the IE we're studying for example

271
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,680
I'll a Ziz al-Hakeem in sort of a carat connects with sort of a juma doesn't it and

272
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,840
Then in the next I Allah says where you only move common the second I aka I a 151

273
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,760
He ends the I a by saying where you I'm the mocomma. I don't take will tell them when he teaches you what you couldn't have known

274
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,360
Well, you couldn't have known because you were ummi in and

275
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I mean is mentioned where?

276
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,680
So to do my this is connecting to that too and then in the last one look at man

277
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,080
Allah who I don't mean in Allah has done a huge favor to the believers

278
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,480
When he appointed a messenger among them so in other Imran he before he mentions these four steps

279
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
He mentions that Allah has done them a huge favor

280
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Guess what's coming in the next time two aisles later in sort of a little juma that I think I follow

281
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,320
Allah you teach me in shot that is the favor of Allah

282
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:54,800
He gives it to whoever he wants so I did run bakara 151 bakara 129 all tie into sort of juma

283
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,800
And one way or the other the aya that we're learning from and so we conclude this with where in Kadovin

284
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,920
Come to the field of the movie even though they had been clearly

285
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,240
Clearly lost now Allah is going to now

286
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:15,800
In the next I open up the future plan of the Oma and that's where I'm really excited to discuss with you guys tomorrow

287
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,720
Inshallah was not only will be finished the first section of the Sunnah tomorrow

288
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,320
We're also going to start section two tomorrows

289
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,160
I'm going to give you an overview of the first section

290
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,280
Which is the first four ayat of the Sunnah two are done today two will be done tomorrow in shahla

291
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,920
And then we will get an overview and begin the the parable portion of the surah

292
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
So that's my doubts for the day

293
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Barak aba al-ghazi walakum fin Quran al-hakim

294
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Wa nafa'ani wa iya'kum bin ayatim wa bi-kikim

295
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,320
Salamu alaikum everyone
