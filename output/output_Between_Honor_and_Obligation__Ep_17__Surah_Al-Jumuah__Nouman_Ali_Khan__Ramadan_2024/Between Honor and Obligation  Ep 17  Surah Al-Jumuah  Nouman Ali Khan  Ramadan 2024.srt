1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And then Allah says, has a punishment.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is a punishment from Allah when people hear the word of Allah and they don't care

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that Allah puts the love of filthy things in their hearts.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He says,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You know they ended up loving the worship of a cow?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And they were obsessed with it.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Where did that filthy love come from? It's shabq.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're a Muslim. How could you do shabq like that?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's the punishment of hearing the word of Allah after being shaken up

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and still dismissing it.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, you want to dismiss it, then Allah does not reside in your heart.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We begin our study of ayah number five.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll translate the ayah first.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's a difficult ayah to translate.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It might come across as offensive, but as we navigate through it,

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
inshallah we'll understand it better and better.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The example of those who were given the responsibility of the Torah,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
who were loaded with the responsibility of the Torah.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Then they did not uphold it, meaning they didn't live up to the responsibility of the Torah.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Asfara is the example of the donkey that is carrying books,

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that is carrying volumes of books.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What a terrible example it is of the group of people or the kind of nation

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
who lied against the revelations of Allah or the signs of Allah,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the miraculous signs of Allah.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Allah does not guide the wrongdoing nation.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's a longer ayah, but it is an ayah about the Israelites clearly.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We're going to take it bit by bit and try to understand it and some of its biblical subtexts.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, the first thing is the word matthal.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
All you need to know about it, simply speaking, is matthal was used for a sculpture.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Like you know when you have a great leader and they build a statue,

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
that's supposed to look like that leader.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So, it's supposed to be a copy of the person that it's representing.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, you see that statue, but you're actually thinking of the person that it represents.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
From it came the idea of misal.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Misal is commonly translated as an example.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the idea of an example is,

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm talking about this concept, but it's directly taking you back to the reality of the situation.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Just like a statue is taking you back in your mind to the real person,

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the example is taking you back to the concept at hand.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So, the fact that masat is being used has to have a purpose.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It always takes you back to something real.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Who's trying something?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't know.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It was there, it seemed to be...

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They'll work on it.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They're good people. Alhamdulillah.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, the purpose of method is to help students with the lesson at hand.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Meaning if Allah starts the ayah with the word method,

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
it must mean there's already an example, a concept that's there,

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and this is going to help us understand why this example is being used.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Like for example, when you study any subject, if you're a student of mathematics,

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and there's a concept that's being explained,

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
right after the concept, here are the following examples.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And then solve the following problems.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So, they'll give you a couple of examples that they've solved for you,

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and then you have to figure out the rest to solve yourself.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Same way when I teach any subject, if I'm teaching Arabic for example, a grammar concept,

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll give a couple of examples of it, then you can solve your own problems.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So, the idea of method here necessarily connects to what came before.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And that's really, really important.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The ayah right before said, you know, that Allah has favored us.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And in the very next ayah, Allah is talking about the Israelites.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why? Because the Israelites were favored by Allah already.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
وَأَنْنِ فَبَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
مَفَبَّلْلَهُمْ عَلَى الْعَلْمِينَ

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
وَآَتَيْنَهُمْ إِلَى الْعَيَاتِ مَا فِيهِ بَدَاءُمْ بُبِينَ

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Multiple places in the Qur'an, Allah says,

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I favored you over all other nations.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We favored them knowingly over other nations

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and gave them all kinds of ayah in which there were great tests and great blessings.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is what he says about the Israelites.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So, he just mentioned us getting fulbul.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And then he mentions the nation that used to have the fulbul.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
As an example, why?

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because now that you're stepping up, you know, like to give you a baseball analogy,

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
when somebody's up to bat, it's their turn.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Right? But before you go up to bat, let me give you the example of the last guy who was in your place.

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Here's the mistake they made.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The purpose of it is, you are now standing in the exact place that the Israelites were standing.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Which means, you are in potential danger of making the same mistakes that they made.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's the point that's being made.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And this mindset really helps us appreciate why the word, you know,

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
the first word that's going to get used after an example is,

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
hummulu, the example of those who were given the burden, who were burdened or loaded with the Torah.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam, is told,

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Inna salulki alaika kaulan saqila.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We are putting a heavy word on you.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The Quran is described as a heavy word.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What did we just learn about the Torah? They were given the burden of the Torah.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What does Allah say about the Quran? It is a heavy word put on the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We ask Allah, at the end of Surat al-Baqarah, after learning about the Israelites in detail,

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
at the end of it, we say,

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
ربنا لا تحمد عدينة إسلن كما حملته على النذين من قبلنا.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Ya Allah, do not place a burden on us like you placed on those who came before us.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
ربنا ولا تحملنا ما لا طاقت لنا به.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Our master do not put a burden on us that we have no power to bear.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So the word burden is now associated with the responsibility of carrying revelation.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We saw in the second ayah, يطلو عليهما ياته ويزكيهم ويعندي مهم الكتاب والحكمة.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And in the next ayah Allah described this as a fadhan.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is a favor of Allah that you get to have the Quran.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now there is the other side.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a privilege, fadhan, it's a privilege, but it's also a massive burden and massive responsibility.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And that's two sides of something.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Like for example, this takes us back also to al-Madik and Aziz,

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
when the king appoints someone as the advisor.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Isn't that a huge privilege?

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But at the same time, a huge responsibility, right?

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So the positions that have the highest privilege also come with the highest responsibility.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We respect people in high positions.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Actually we respect them because they have to carry high responsibilities.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's what makes them respectable.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You see?

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So your teacher is respected because he has higher responsibility.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The principal is more respected.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The dean of the university is even more respected because they're carrying higher and higher responsibilities.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Now we are privileged to have the Quran and we have the responsibility of the burden of carrying the Quran.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So it's important that now that you have this privilege, congratulations, that's the fadhah of Allah,

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
now you better watch out because this privilege will go away the moment you no longer carry your responsibility.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Like any job, you can have the most prestigious job,

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but the moment you don't do justice with your job, you get humiliated.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You could have the job of the president, a really prestigious job,

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and then you're corrupt in your role and you're the most humiliated person in the country

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
because you misuse that role.

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So now that Muslims are in this position, they need to know what happened to people who were privileged before you

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and they lost that privilege.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You don't want to fall into this position.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Look at these other ayat in the Quran that similarly allude to this concept.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If they turn away then the messenger is only responsible for the burden that was placed on him.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you are only responsible for the burden that was placed on you.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
When you are to follow him, you will be committed to guidance.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And the only obligation the messenger has is to communicate clearly.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Another ayat in the Quran, actually this is a scary one, but I'm going to...

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You know what? Let me just tell it to you now.

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We offered the trust to the skies and the earth and the mountains

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and they all refused to carry the burden.

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They all refused to carry the trust.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The trust is actually the choice to do right and wrong in Surat al-Ahzab.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And Allah is saying the choice to do right and wrong was...

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Human beings were privileged with high intellect.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
They were privileged with the soul, the Ruh that Allah blew inside them.

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And as a result they have more power to make right choices than any other creature.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So when this power, this trust, that I'll let you make whatever choice you want,

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
when this trust was being handed to any other creation, they could not hold it.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But the human being decided to hold it.

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And in the next ayat Allah says,

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And it so ended up happening that Allah will end up punishing the hypocrites of the men and the women.

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And the mushrikeen, men and women.

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Who was mentioned first? Mushrikun or hypocrites?

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hypocrites are people who accept the responsibility, who have, who accept the religion,

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and then play games with the religion.

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Those are the hypocrites.

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They were put on the responsibility first because they actually consciously took the responsibility.

154
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Anyway, so that's a little bit about the notion of carrying the responsibility,

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
those who were given the load of carrying the Torah.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Before we go on, we should also learn some things about the word Torah.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The word Torah comes from the Hebrew language and is pronounced as Torah.

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It is usually translated as law or instruction,

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and is considered as the most sacred text in Judaism.

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The Torah consists of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible,

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy,

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and includes God's instructions, guidance, and teachings for the Jewish people.

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So generally speaking, the Torah refers to the Old Testament,

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the five books of the Old Testament.

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
In Hebrew, it is from the root YAH-RAHA, which is similar to Arabic,

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Wari actually, which has the primary meaning throw or shoot.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
In the derived Haif-al form, Af-A'la form, the verb means to teach,

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
to throw knowledge towards someone else.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So from that, the noun Torah means direction or instruction.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So actually, Torah literally means instruction or law or direction.

171
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's what the word comes from.

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Now, let me give you an example.

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is just an example. This is not what the Qur'an says.

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I just want to explain a point to you.

175
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Those who were charged with the Qur'an then didn't uphold it.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If I say that, those who were charged with the Qur'an and didn't uphold it,

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
is that a comment about all of those who were charged with the Qur'an

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
or some of those who were charged with the Qur'an?

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Huh?

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If you say all, then it means none of them upheld it.

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If you say those who were charged with the Qur'an and didn't uphold it,

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
only these people.

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So when Allah says,

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
مثل لذين فمل التورات ثم لم يفملها,

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the example of those who were charged with the Torah and didn't uphold it,

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
is that all the Jews are some of the Jews.

187
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you understand the point?

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There are those who were given the Torah that upheld it.

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Allah talks about them.

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There were those that were given the Torah that lived by it and died by it.

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And there are heroes. They're talked about in the Qur'an too.

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This example, see what happens sometimes is

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
people want to find, oh, the Qur'an is anti-Semitic

194
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
or the Qur'an is anti-Jewish.

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Actually, it's pretty pro-Jewish.

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
More Jewish prophets are mentioned,

197
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
more Israelite prophets are mentioned than any other nation's prophets in the Qur'an.

198
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Musa A.S. has mentioned over 70 times in the Qur'an.

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Right?

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And one of the noble prophets that even our prophet is supposed to take inspiration from.

201
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But the most important piece here is Allah does not only criticize the Jews

202
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and He does not only praise the Jews and He does not only...

203
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There's no only. There's in specific cases, specific case studies are mentioned.

204
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This is a case study of those who were charged with the Torah and didn't live up to it.

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Now, let's understand what does it mean to be charged with the Torah?

206
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It actually means those who studied it, those who learned it, the scholars among them.

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And again, not all scholars among them, some scholars among them

208
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
who after having learned it did not live up to it.

209
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
They did not live up to it.

210
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Hum Mila also is a passive verb, which I'll explain in a second.

211
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Now, because there's a lot of work to do today on this,

212
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I want to first get through our understanding.

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How does the Qur'an explain this concept?

214
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
When He says they didn't live up to the Torah, they didn't carry it.

215
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, how does He explain that they didn't carry it?

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm going to go through a number of ayat.

217
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This is not comprehensive, but it should give you a pretty decent idea.

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What I want you to keep in your mind is the first thing I said.

219
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why is this example being given? For whose benefit?

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Ours. So every mistake of theirs is potentially whose mistake?

221
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's ours. We have to have a really good look at ourselves as we read this.

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
First,

223
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The worst pits of hell are for those who wrote the law with their own hands

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and then said, this is from Allah.

225
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So they can make some small, cathetic profit from it.

226
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
They toyed with the law of Allah.

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So,

228
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
then terrible hell is for them because of what their hands wrote

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and terrible hell is for them because of what they keep on earning.

230
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So the first thing is to come up with laws and fatwas and rulings

231
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and then say this is actually from Allah, but do it for corrupt reasons.

232
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That'd be genuine.

233
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You will see a huge population among them that make a lot of efforts

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
to spread animosity and sin.

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They want to spread harm and animosity, hate.

236
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And they want to eat corrupt food, meaning they want to eat from illegitimate means,

237
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
haram means, through cheating, through lying, through stealing, through robbery.

238
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They are making terrible their behaviors have been.

239
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And the Jews said,

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Allah's hands are tied.

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Allah's hands are tied.

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
May their hands be tied.

243
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And they should be cursed because of what they said.

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Now, what does it mean Allah's hands are tied?

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Where's Allah? Allah's not doing anything.

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why is this happening to us?

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Why is this, why is his hands tied?

248
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Where was Allah when I had a car accident?

249
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Where was Allah when I lost my job?

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Where was Allah when this happened in this country and that happened in that country?

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Where was, what are they trying to say?

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Allah's hands are tied.

253
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Alhamdulillah, we don't do that.

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oops.

255
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
He spends how he wants.

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well,

258
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Watch this and a good number of them,

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
what has been sent to you from your rub makes them even more rebellious and more, more, more disbelieving.

260
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Meaning they get offended by the word of Allah.

261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And we have put animosity and hatred between them for each other until judgment day.

262
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Every time they try to start a new fire of war, Allah puts it out.

263
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They make all kinds of efforts to create corruption in the land, in the region.

264
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Allah does not love those who cause corruption.

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
They even killed prophets.

266
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Allah says,

267
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Every time a prophet would come to them,

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
a messenger would come telling them something they don't want to hear,

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
either they called him a liar or they got him killed.

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, we don't have any more prophets after Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam,

271
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
but we have people that would invite people or educate people about what the prophet taught,

272
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
what the Book of Allah taught, and sometimes we don't want to hear what the Book of Allah says.

273
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So what did we do with certain people that were saying this is what Allah says?

274
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We would either call them liars, humiliate them, disgrace them, or even get them killed.

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There were many great scholars of Islamic history that were jailed, beat, tortured, killed, humiliated,

276
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and many of them even today, people say lots of lies against them.

277
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm not afraid to say it.

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I think Imam Abu Hanifa r.a is one of the most lied about people in Islamic history.

279
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Like even people who like him lie about him, don't even know.

280
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Like there's so much wrong done with certain people in our history and he's one of those people.

281
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He's one of the Muslim-mean in Islamic history.

282
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Honest to God.

283
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And there's just, he was such a remarkable figure and then later on the worst things were associated with him.

284
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And you know how sometimes, I'll give you an analogy, sometimes you go to some people's house,

285
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
they insult you nicely.

286
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You know what I'm talking about?

287
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, Mashallah, you still have the same job, huh?

288
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hey, you still driving that Toyota?

289
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Cool.

290
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah, I remember.

291
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Does it still have the same scratches?

292
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Are those people who insult you nicely?

293
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There's a lot of people who insult the scholars of the past nicely.

294
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
May Allah reward him, Mashallah.

295
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And then they'll still all catalyze about.

296
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And this, this is for the Fariqah and Kebzabu and Fariqah and Yakturun.

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
They would kill prophets.

298
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
They would lie against prophets.

299
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We don't, Alhamdulillah, there's no more prophets.

300
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But the next best thing is the ambassador of the prophets.

301
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Who are the ambassadors of the prophets?

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The scholars.

303
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So the ones who, among them, who did speak the truth, they, you, you didn't want to hear what they have to say,

304
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
because what happened with the Israelites where they were living under kingdoms

305
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and so their religious hierarchy was associated with the government.

306
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So if a scholar came and said something the government didn't want to hear,

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
then he would put the, his payroll scholars to go after the scholar that's not on the payroll and annihilate him.

308
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
If that wasn't enough, get them killed.

309
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Get rid of them all together.

310
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You know? Throw them in jail. Do this to that.

311
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So this is Fariqah and Kebzabu and Fariqah and Yakturun.

312
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Ka'nu la'yatanaahuna an munkarin fa'aloo. This is scary.

313
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
They didn't use to stop each other from bad things that they did.

314
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
They just didn't let it happen and just say,

315
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
what can I do? There's just us, who they are, is who they do.

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
They wouldn't even say anything bad about it.

317
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
La bisa ma ka'nu ya fa'aloo, what a terrible thing they were doing.

318
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Meaning, not only were the bad people doing something bad,

319
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
the people that were standing and watching were also doing something terrible.

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Just becoming bystanders.

321
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Ya ayyu an ladinaa manoo la tasalua an asyaa, entubdala kum tasaukum.

322
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Those of you who have faith, don't ask about things that if you find out about them,

323
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
they will hurt you.

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Wa entasalua anhaa hayda yu-razaan mukr'aan, tubdala kum, a'fa allahu anhaa.

325
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And if you ask about them, when the Quran is still coming down,

326
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
they will be made clear to you, Allah has forgiven certain things.

327
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Meaning, if Allah didn't talk about something,

328
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
if Allah didn't say this is halal or this is haram, He didn't discuss the issue.

329
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's not because Allah didn't remember to discuss the issue.

330
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's because whatever He doesn't mention, He has forgiven.

331
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's what Allah is saying, a'fa allahu anhaa.

332
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Allah has already forgiven it.

333
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But what do people want to know?

334
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Can you tell me about this? Can you tell me about this?

335
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Can you tell me about this?

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Musa A.S. told the people, slaughter a cow.

337
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Easy, slaughter a cow.

338
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What is it? No, a cow will cover cow.

339
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
How big, how tall, how fat, skinny, you know, it's still confusing.

340
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And the more questions they asked, the answer became easier and more difficult.

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So who created the difficulty?

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Their questions created the difficulty.

343
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Their questions created the difficulty.

344
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And He says, Allah says,

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
There were people before you that used to ask a lot of questions

346
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
on creating more and more complications.

347
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And because of it, they became disbelievers.

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Because of their questions, they became disbelievers.

349
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.

350
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you

351
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com

352
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and help other sign up, even sponsor students for bayinatv.com

353
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
so we can create worldwide communities of students that are studying the meanings

354
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran

355
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and are insha'Allah, spreading that in their own circles.

356
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Thanks so much.

357
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Because of their questions, they became disbelievers.

358
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So that's one, you know, it's not like you're not allowed to ask questions.

359
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Of course, you're allowed to ask questions.

360
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But when you're trying to split hairs, you know,

361
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and get into nitty gritty details, details on top of details on top of details,

362
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
complicating things more than they need to be complicated, you know,

363
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
then you're just creating, you're making the religion so difficult

364
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
that you can't even practice it.

365
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It will become impossible.

366
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Okay.

367
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So now another disease that they used to have.

368
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You were the people from Mahantum Ha'udah,

369
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Takhtulun Anfusakum Wa Toqriyuna Fariqa Minkum Min Diyaarihim.

370
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You were the same people who used to kill each other.

371
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
They were Muslims, killing other Muslims.

372
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But then, and then you were killing, you were expelling them,

373
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
your own people from your own homes,

374
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and you were taking over each other's properties,

375
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
T'allah Aruna Aalaihim Bilal I.

376
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You were making aggressive moves against each other,

377
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
invading each other's properties, taking each other's land and things like that.

378
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But then after you fought each other,

379
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
by the way, when the Muslims fought each other, they became weak.

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If a family is having fights within itself, the family is weak,

381
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
which means it's easier to attack from the outside.

382
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So when the Israelites fought each other, other nations saw that they're weak.

383
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So they started invading them.

384
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
When they invaded them, many of them became slaves.

385
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Then they would have fundraisers, our Muslim brothers are being tortured.

386
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Please, raise some money so we can free our Muslim brothers.

387
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Wa In Ya'atukum Musaara Tufaduhum

388
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
When they come to you as slaves, you go and pay money to rescue them.

389
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You want to raise money for that cause.

390
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Wa Wa Mu'harramun Aalaikum Ikhrajuhum

391
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Kicking them out of their homes in the first place was haram for you.

392
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You created a conflict that led them to become this way,

393
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and then you want to come and rescue them. This is what Tufrah says.

394
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The first was the infighting, and then there was a whole help your fellow brother.

395
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This hypocrisy was created within them.

396
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay, then,

397
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Ifa Tugliluna Bi Ba'ud Lil Kitabi Wa Takt Furuna Bi Ba'ud

398
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Do you believe in some parts of the book and just completely reject other parts of the book?

399
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Fa Maa Jazaa'u Ma Ya'f'alu Dhalika

400
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Inlaa Khizyul Fi Al Hayatul Dunyaa

401
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What could be the payback for someone who does something like that,

402
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
except they should be humiliated in this light?

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
They should live in humiliation.

404
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Wa Yaumal Qiyamati Yuradunaylaa Shadil Adab

405
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
In the Day of Resurrection, they will be taken back to the worst of punishments.

406
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh, this one's scary. Wa Qaalul Qulubuna Wulf

407
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
They said, our hearts are wrapped up.

408
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Our hearts are safe, no matter what.

409
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
As bad as I am, I still have iman in my heart.

410
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It doesn't matter how... Okay, ya, this is haram, this is haram, this is haram.

411
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I do a lot of haram, but I'm a good person.

412
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
In my heart, I'm still a good person.

413
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You should know that. Don't judge my heart.

414
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
My heart is still good.

415
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
O' Allah says,

416
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Allaahubu'Allah bi Kufrihim

417
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Allah crush them because they're denial.

418
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Fa Qalilam Ma Ya'yut Bilun. How little they have faith.

419
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
This way of saying, ya, ya, ya, I'd shut.

420
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You're right, I do a lot of bad things, but I'm not that bad because deep down inside...

421
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Deep down, really deep down.

422
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Wa Lammaa Jaaahum Kitabubin A'indil Nahi Musaddikul Dima Maaahum

423
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And when they would make predictions of the future,

424
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
that when the final prophet comes, you will see,

425
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, it's gonna be awesome. We're gonna win.

426
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Ah, that sounds familiar.

427
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
When the signs of judgment take come, then the Muslims are gonna...

428
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Right now though, my heart's in a good place.

429
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Wa Qalilam Min Kumli Astaftihaun A'adil Adha Bina Qafal. Okay.

430
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Allah says to them, Listen.

431
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He holds the mountain above them.

432
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
He scares them and says,

433
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Hold on to what I'm giving you with might.

434
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Wa Saba'u, Listen.

435
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Qa'udu Sama'ana Wa As-Sina.

436
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
They say, We heard and we disobeyed.

437
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You know what this is? Let me tell you.

438
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Sometimes Allah scares people.

439
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He puts them in a very scary situation.

440
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And in that scary situation, they realize they must obey Allah.

441
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And soon after that scary situation,

442
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
when the scary situation is gone, what happens to those people?

443
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
They're gonna...

444
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Allah's not mad anymore.

445
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I think I can go back to normal now.

446
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Like Allah gives the analogy of even non-believers,

447
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
you know, when they're traveling by sea and the sea becomes turbulent,

448
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
they all start remembering Allah.

449
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Right? If you're on a plane and the medical mouth mask falls.

450
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Right?

451
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Oops, sorry.

452
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The pilot fell asleep.

453
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You can put the medical mouth mask back up.

454
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Okay, well, I'll go back to Netflix then.

455
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Right?

456
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So there's a...

457
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And the idea here is actually even more than that.

458
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They were shaken up and they were told,

459
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
listen to what we are giving you seriously.

460
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And hold on to it.

461
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And they said, we hear, but later on, even though they heard it,

462
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
they still disobeyed.

463
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And then Allah says, has a punishment.

464
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This is a punishment from Allah when people hear the word of Allah

465
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and they don't care that Allah puts the love of filthy things in their hearts.

466
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
He says,

467
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You know, they ended up loving the worship of a cow.

468
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And they were obsessed with it.

469
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Where did that filthy love come from?

470
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's shirk.

471
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You're a Muslim.

472
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
How could you just do shirk like that?

473
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That's the punishment of hearing the word of Allah after being shaken up

474
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and still dismissing it.

475
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Well, you want to dismiss it, then Allah does not reside in your heart.

476
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Then you...

477
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He'll allow that heart to be flooded with all kinds of shirk

478
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and creepy weird practices.

479
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And you'll find, I don't have to spell this out to you,

480
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
but there's no shortage of weird shirk-y,

481
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
total idol worship type practices across the Muslim world.

482
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Total idol worship type, like crazy, and they call themselves Muslim.

483
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And they do the most like non-Muslim things.

484
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Openly.

485
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I was told that I promised to stop my worship

486
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
but most of them made a promise breaking.

487
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Every time they made any promise, they threw it away.

488
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
They couldn't keep any promises.

489
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I learned this the hard way in Pakistan.

490
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I thought things would get better.

491
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You know what I learned about Islam?

492
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
When somebody says, don't worry about it at all.

493
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Done.

494
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Take care.

495
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That's when you should worry.

496
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
When the guy says,

497
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm thinking about it, I don't know.

498
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Oh my God.

499
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The more guarantees, the more guarantees,

500
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
the more lies.

501
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Why?

502
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Why?

503
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Allah says every time they made any promise,

504
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
they threw it behind their back.

505
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I was speaking to a senior in Pakistan intellectual,

506
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
became a friend of mine.

507
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I love making friends with elders.

508
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
They're just so wise.

509
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He said, you know what our problem is in our country?

510
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We're just in the habit of lying about the smallest things.

511
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
We just have to lie.

512
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
We don't even have, there's no reason.

513
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We still do it.

514
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
We still do it.

515
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You're like, your friend is waiting for you at the door, right?

516
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And he calls you and says, you coming?

517
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You could say, I need five minutes.

518
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You say, no, no, I'm already down the stairs.

519
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm right there, bro.

520
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm right there.

521
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Just 10 seconds, 10 minutes later.

522
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Right?

523
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
There was no reason to lie, but you still have to do it.

524
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You know?

525
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Hey, have you finished the Saim-e-Dalagi-Bu?

526
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Alhamdulillah.

527
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You guys are unrelated, Alhamdulillah.

528
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I wasn't related to what you said.

529
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I was just saying praise the Lord to Allah.

530
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Then here's the other scary one.

531
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You will find them the most desiring of living.

532
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
They just want to live.

533
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
They just don't want to die.

534
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Even more than the people who do shirk.

535
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Each one of them wants to live a thousand years.

536
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You know how this is a new one.

537
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I didn't think this would happen to us, but a lot of people

538
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Muslims come up to me, young and old.

539
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I have a real fear of dying.

540
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I just don't want to die.

541
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Why do you lucky death?

542
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I have nightmares about dying.

543
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Why are you afraid of dying?

544
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We came from Allah.

545
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
We return back to Allah.

546
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
This is an episode of our life.

547
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
This is not the end of our life.

548
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I met a doctor who told me he deals with patients that are on the verge of death.

549
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You know?

550
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And sometimes he has to tell the family he only has a month left.

551
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
He has two weeks left.

552
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If you'd like to take him off the machine and take them home or whatever,

553
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
take them off dialysis, etc., then it's your choice.

554
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And he says, man, I deal with atheist families, Jewish families, Christian families, Hindu families,

555
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
all kinds of Muslim families.

556
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And the only families to say, no, no, no, he cannot die.

557
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
He cannot die.

558
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Keep him on the machine.

559
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I know his brain is not working anymore.

560
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But no, no, no, that cannot be.

561
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We cannot have him die.

562
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The only families that do that are the Muslim families.

563
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Everybody else says he had a good life.

564
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The atheist says I had a good life.

565
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me go in peace.

566
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
They have no problem.

567
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The Hindu says, okay, I'll come back.

568
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Karma, I'll come back.

569
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Patelliteb, whatever, I'll come back.

570
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The only people now that cannot accept the notion of death, how could this happen?

571
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
How could death happen?

572
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
No, no, no, they're still alive.

573
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
They can't go.

574
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
They can't go.

575
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And they can't accept it over and over again.

576
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You know what Allah did with us?

577
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
We don't hand the body over to a cremation company so they can deal with it.

578
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Or to a company that embalms the body or who washes the body?

579
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The family members.

580
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Who puts the coffin on the body?

581
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
The family members.

582
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Traditionally, who put the body in the grave?

583
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The family, why?

584
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Because Allah's, this religion teaches you to deal with death, not run from it to deal with it.

585
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
These realites developed a terrible fear of death.

586
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Terrible fear of death.

587
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's reminding me of a hadith of the Prophet Salli Shalim when he said that people are going to eat from us like wolves, tear up a sheep.

588
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And he said, what's the, when he was asked, Malmalja, how are we going to get out of this?

589
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
He said, remember death a lot, right?

590
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And that's some people look at that and say, why shouldn't I remember death a lot?

591
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It's depressing.

592
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The point of that hadith is people will become so obsessed with what?

593
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Life that they don't want to accept the reality of death.

594
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's not that you should wake up and say, I'm going to die.

595
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Breakfast, I'm going to die.

596
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You're going to have lunch, I'm going to die.

597
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That's not what's being said.

598
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's just that you're so engulfed in life that you're denying the reality of death.

599
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You're denying that this life is a journey.

600
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And this was something that they before us, you know,

601
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,000
they're not going to be getting away from punishment if they no longer how much, how long they live.

602
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Here's another one that they did.

603
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They had this problem. Alhamdulillah.

604
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
We don't have this problem anywhere in the Muslim world.

605
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You're alimuna nasa siha.

606
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
They used to teach people, the angels were sent to teach them magic.

607
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And they were told when you learn magic,

608
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
if you learn this, you'll become kafir.

609
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And they would learn things that would cause them harm.

610
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You mayu farraqoola bihi bayin al-lalhi was a uji.

611
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
They would especially learn magic that would cause marriages to break up or a proposal to not go through.

612
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Or this girl should never get married.

613
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Or that guy should become sick before his engagement happens.

614
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Or this is what they, this is where a lot of the magic industry went with them.

615
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Alhamdulillah, we don't do that.

616
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
We're good.

617
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Wa-lāhum bi-dhāri nabihī min-ahadil l-lābīdilā.

618
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You couldn't be harming anybody with this kind of stuff except by Allah's permission.

619
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Wa-yate'allam ulamayyaduruhum alayyamfa'uhum.

620
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And they would only learn something that would harm them and not benefit them.

621
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Wa-lābīt samāsharul bihi anfusahum.

622
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Wa-lāqad alimu lamanishtara'um ala'u fil-ākhirati min-khadā'a.

623
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And they knew whoever uses any of this or tries to do any of this

624
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
will have no portion in the akhira.

625
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What a horrible thing they sold themselves for.

626
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
If they only knew, lo kan li'alam.

627
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Min-adadīnahadu yuharrifūn al-kalīmā amma wādi'i.

628
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Among the Israelites, the Jews, there are some who remove the word from its place.

629
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Allah says one thing, they say, no, that's not what it means, this is what it means.

630
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That's not what it says, this is what it says.

631
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Messing with the words.

632
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Now with the Qur'an, we can't change the word of Allah, right?

633
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Here's a creative exercise.

634
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Okay, we can't change the words.

635
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Let's just tell people, I know this is what it says,

636
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
but it says X, but what it really means is Y.

637
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I know it says X, I know, I know.

638
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I know Allah is the best speaker, and he's very clear in his speech.

639
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But what this really means is something else.

640
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Or, oh, this is what the ayah is, but no, no, no, this ayah, we don't know how to follow this ayah.

641
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We have to follow this ayah.

642
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What?

643
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yuharrifūn al-kalīmā amma wādi'i.

644
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yakūluna sama'ina wa'a'asayna.

645
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And they say, we hear and we disobey.

646
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Wasma'a ghayla wa'sma'in.

647
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And we hear in a way that shouldn't be heard.

648
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Wa ra'ina layyam bi'a'asinati.

649
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Meaning they twist their tongue and make insults.

650
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Ta'anan fiddīn.

651
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
They are sarcastic in the matter of religion.

652
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Wa qalū an'ahu wa la'u an'ahu.

653
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Wa la'u an'ahu wa'sma'u an'ahu.

654
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Wa'sma'u an'ahu wa'sma'u an'ahu.

655
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And if they had only heard and obeyed, wa'sma'u an'ahu wa'sma'u an'ahu.

656
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And had listened and said, wait for us.

657
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
La qāna khayran la'u an'ahu wa'a'ahu.

658
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
There would have been better for them.

659
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
They, okay, here's the next one.

660
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Again, something, al-ḥamdu liLlāh, we are immune.

661
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
They, he says, and you know, he says,

662
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
ma yawaddu lladheena kafurumil an'al kitā'u wa l-al-mushinkīn

663
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
an'u nazzala aalaykum min khayri'ma rabbikum.

664
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
They never want that something good should come to you.

665
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
They hate that something good should come to you.

666
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Wa la'u yashtasubi r-rahmati himayyasha.

667
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And the knowledgeable among them hate that you now have revelation.

668
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Meaning they feel like if you have knowledge of revelation,

669
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
then people are not going to come to us.

670
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
They're not going to be impressed with our knowledge now

671
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
because you have that knowledge.

672
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So they don't want that for you.

673
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Muslims within each other, you know, even in the Islamic space.

674
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Even in the Islamic space.

675
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You know, sometimes you can learn something good

676
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
from someone who knows a lot less than you.

677
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Is that possible? Right?

678
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But you notice that sometimes there's somebody who knows a lot more

679
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and someone who knows a lot less.

680
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But the one who knows a lot less is a lot more popular.

681
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah?

682
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And the one who knows a lot more gets really upset.

683
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But the guy who knows a lot less is more popular.

684
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And maybe he says some wrong things, whatever he says.

685
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But does he say something good also?

686
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah, he said me, this is something good.

687
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Now, when you can do two things, you could say,

688
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Hey, mashā'Allah, you're popular, you're reaching a lot of people.

689
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Here are some mistakes you're making. Let me help you with them privately.

690
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Because you care about this person and the good that they do.

691
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
But is that what we do?

692
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Let me now, because I'm less popular, let me now announce to the world

693
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
how wrong this person is and highlight all of the wrong that they do.

694
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And then tell people, yeah, there's some good things, mashā'Allah.

695
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But you know what?

696
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Those good things don't count for anything because look at all these wrongs.

697
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Look at all these mistakes.

698
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
They cannot stand that something good might come from someone else.

699
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You can't.

700
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
What is, you know, our religion has very simple principles.

701
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
If I have a problem with someone, what should I do?

702
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Talk about them or talk to them?

703
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Talk to them.

704
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Our religion has very simple principles.

705
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Hide the faults of your brother and sister or broadcast the faults of your brother and sister.

706
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
What is it?

707
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Whoever covers a believer, Allah covers them on judgment day.

708
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
A lot of our Islamic content now is dedicated to one person destroying another person.

709
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yes or no?

710
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
My question is, that person who wanted to destroy that other person,

711
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
couldn't email them, couldn't find their phone number, couldn't go to their masjid,

712
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
couldn't go to their, didn't have a conversation with them, couldn't sit and talk, they couldn't do that.

713
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
They had to go to the world first and say what a kafir they are first.

714
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That was step one.

715
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
This is what I don't understand.

716
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
There's one thing that you, you know, at least you talk to the person.

717
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You talk to them, you have a conversation with them.

718
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You know?

719
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And even on top of that, my own theory, you don't have to agree with this.

720
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Human beings will always disagree with each other.

721
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And no human being will ever be perfect.

722
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You could spend your energy describing how wrong someone else is,

723
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
or you could spend your energy showing, doing something right.

724
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You could, you decide where you want to put your energy.

725
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You know?

726
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Some people, some people's entire religion just becomes correcting someone else,

727
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
knocking somebody else down.

728
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Right?

729
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And if somebody else is actually doing something really terrible,

730
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
or it's a very wrong idea that they're spreading, you know what?

731
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Ideas should be attacked.

732
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The Quran teaches us to attack ideas, instead of attacking what?

733
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
People.

734
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
We become obsessed with attacking people, instead of ideas.

735
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Now the thing is, when you attack a person, that person is made up of good ideas and bad ideas.

736
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
When you attack that person, you have refuted everything.

737
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But if you attack ideas, then you are making everyone move up.

738
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You're helping each other.

739
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But this, this is not what they did.

740
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
They don't like that good would come to somebody else.

741
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
There's one last one.

742
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Adhan has also been given.

743
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
They started believing nobody will enter Jannah except us.

744
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
These are the wishful thoughts.

745
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
How to burhanakum?

746
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Bring your proof.

747
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'll say bring your proof.

748
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Is there any ayah in the Quran that says nobody will enter Jannah except you people?

749
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That Allah give us a guarantee that you and I are going to enter Jannah.

750
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
No.

751
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
He says,

752
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
koo an fusakum ba'aadikum nara.

753
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Save yourselves and your families from the fire.

754
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
He says,

755
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
ya ayu an nadina amanu koo an fusakum ba'aadikum nara.

756
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
He didn't say,

757
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
ya ayu an nadina katharu koo an fusakum ba'aadikum nara.

758
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
He said,

759
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
those of you who believe, save yourselves and your families from the fire.

760
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Wait.

761
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
No, no, no.

762
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Bur believers.

763
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
We're already safe.

764
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
This should be said to those who don't believe.

765
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
The rest of you, save yourselves from the fire, because we are already on the safe side.

766
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
No, he says, those of you who believe, save yourselves and your families from the fire.

767
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
What does that tell you?

768
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Believers don't have a false sense of security.

769
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And because they don't have that, they're not, they don't have any mental energy to decide who is and isn't going to help.

770
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
They don't have energy for that, because they've got to worry about themselves.

771
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
They've got to worry about them.

772
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
How many people come to me and say, what's going to happen to Mother Teresa?

773
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Is that your concern on Judgment Day, bro?

774
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Like honestly, when we rise and you see the sun and the moon colliding with each other and the oceans boiling, you're like, where's Mother Teresa?

775
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Well, are you honestly going to be the day on which a mother will drop her baby?

776
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The day on which a person will run from their own family.

777
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You're like, but I have a good coworker.

778
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm just wondering if they're going to go to hell or not.

779
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Why is this even your concern?

780
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Do you not believe in Allah the just?

781
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Do you not believe in Allah the knower of all things?

782
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Do you not believe in Allah who understands the inside and the outside?

783
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Why do you have to have an answer?

784
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And if I say, if I help you out and say, you know what, your coworker, nice guy, yeah, Allah will put him in jannah.

785
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You are not sure.

786
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
We're not even sure about ourselves, are we?

787
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Then why do you want guarantees for someone else?

788
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Where did this mentality come from?

789
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It came from we're already saved.

790
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I want other people to join the saved group.

791
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
This is self-righteousness.

792
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Don't declare yourselves pure.

793
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Don't declare yourself saved.

794
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
He knows better who has taqwa.

795
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
They developed this mentality.

796
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And unfortunately, and we didn't even say, well, Muslims are saved.

797
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
We don't say that.

798
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
We say my version of Muslims are saved.

799
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:15,000
My people, my mentor, my sheikh, my whoever, and the people that wear the same uniform as me, wear the saved ones.

800
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Everybody else, you know, they're just barbecued.

801
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
These, this is what, why do I go through all of these ayat?

802
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Allah said what?

803
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Those who were given the burden of the Torah and they didn't carry it.

804
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
They took the religion and made it into something else.

805
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
This is not what Allah gave.

806
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
They turned it into a different religion altogether.

807
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And Allah says, this is this.

808
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm giving you this example because now you have been privileged.

809
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Don't make these mistakes.

810
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And if we have been making these mistakes, enough of us, not all of us,

811
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
but enough of us have been making these mistakes,

812
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
now it's time we put a stop to it.

813
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Now it's time we, you know, we have to study the Israelites

814
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
as we are studying ourselves, actually.

815
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You know what, in medical school they do, right?

816
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
They study the cadaver, the dead body,

817
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
because they're actually studying the future patient.

818
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
We're studying the Israelites, not to study the Israelites.

819
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
We're studying them to study ourselves.

820
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
The Lord, that's what we're honest, but Allah's guidance for us.

821
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Not fun facts from history.

822
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So as I leave you, one of the, this is not where it gets things really cool.

823
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I'll tell you at the end of after the prayer,

824
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
but one of the things I will share with you,

825
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
the example given was of a donkey that carries a burden.

826
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Check this out.

827
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
One of the sages of the school of Eliyahu taught,

828
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
this is Jewish literature, the rabbinical literature.

829
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This is the Babylonian Talmud.

830
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
A person should always make himself subjugated to matters of the Torah,

831
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
like an ox to a yoke, and like a donkey to a burden.

832
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So the Torah actually said you should be committed to the book,

833
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
like a donkey is committed to the burden on it.

834
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So they use this analogy to say,

835
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
this demonstrates how committed you should be to the book of Allah.

836
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Allah took that image and reversed it and said,

837
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
yes, the analogy is true, but you actually became someone

838
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
who has no idea what it's carrying, like a donkey carrying a bunch of books.

839
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The analogy is actually not originally Oran,

840
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
the analogy is actually taken from rabbinical literature

841
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
and being re-engineered to make this point.

842
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So how Allah, okay, and then we'll discuss more of this after the Salat.

843
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Barakallahu wa Alaykum, As-salamu alaykum wa rehmatullah.

844
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Here's what's coming up in the next episode

845
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and this deeper look of Surat al-Jumu'ah.

846
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So the donkey that was trying to get rid of its burden ended up carrying even more.

847
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Which is an interesting analogy because the Israelites,

848
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
they tried to play with the word of Allah

849
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and the more they tried to play with it, life became more and more difficult for them.

850
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
The more complications came in their life.

851
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Obeying the word of Allah makes life easy.

852
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Disobeying the word of Allah makes life difficult.

853
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
That is the Quran's formula that's always been there since the beginning.
