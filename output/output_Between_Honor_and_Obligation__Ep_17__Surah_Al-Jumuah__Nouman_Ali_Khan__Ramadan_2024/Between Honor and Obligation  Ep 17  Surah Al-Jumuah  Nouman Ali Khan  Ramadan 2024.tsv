0	2000	And then Allah says, has a punishment.
2000	6000	This is a punishment from Allah when people hear the word of Allah and they don't care
6000	10000	that Allah puts the love of filthy things in their hearts.
10000	11000	He says,
13000	16000	You know they ended up loving the worship of a cow?
16000	18000	And they were obsessed with it.
18000	21000	Where did that filthy love come from? It's shabq.
21000	24000	You're a Muslim. How could you do shabq like that?
24000	28000	That's the punishment of hearing the word of Allah after being shaken up
28000	30000	and still dismissing it.
30000	33000	Well, you want to dismiss it, then Allah does not reside in your heart.
58000	71000	We begin our study of ayah number five.
71000	73000	I'll translate the ayah first.
73000	75000	It's a difficult ayah to translate.
75000	78000	It might come across as offensive, but as we navigate through it,
78000	80000	inshallah we'll understand it better and better.
80000	84000	The example of those who were given the responsibility of the Torah,
84000	87000	who were loaded with the responsibility of the Torah.
87000	94000	Then they did not uphold it, meaning they didn't live up to the responsibility of the Torah.
94000	101000	Asfara is the example of the donkey that is carrying books,
101000	103000	that is carrying volumes of books.
103000	113000	What a terrible example it is of the group of people or the kind of nation
113000	118000	who lied against the revelations of Allah or the signs of Allah,
118000	120000	the miraculous signs of Allah.
120000	126000	Allah does not guide the wrongdoing nation.
126000	132000	That's a longer ayah, but it is an ayah about the Israelites clearly.
132000	136000	We're going to take it bit by bit and try to understand it and some of its biblical subtexts.
136000	138000	So, the first thing is the word matthal.
138000	144000	All you need to know about it, simply speaking, is matthal was used for a sculpture.
144000	147000	Like you know when you have a great leader and they build a statue,
147000	149000	that's supposed to look like that leader.
149000	154000	So, it's supposed to be a copy of the person that it's representing.
154000	158000	So, you see that statue, but you're actually thinking of the person that it represents.
158000	160000	From it came the idea of misal.
160000	163000	Misal is commonly translated as an example.
163000	165000	And the idea of an example is,
165000	170000	I'm talking about this concept, but it's directly taking you back to the reality of the situation.
170000	174000	Just like a statue is taking you back in your mind to the real person,
174000	178000	the example is taking you back to the concept at hand.
178000	182000	So, the fact that masat is being used has to have a purpose.
182000	185000	It always takes you back to something real.
187000	189000	Who's trying something?
189000	191000	I don't know.
191000	193000	It was there, it seemed to be...
193000	194000	They'll work on it.
194000	196000	They're good people. Alhamdulillah.
196000	200000	So, the purpose of method is to help students with the lesson at hand.
200000	203000	Meaning if Allah starts the ayah with the word method,
203000	208000	it must mean there's already an example, a concept that's there,
208000	213000	and this is going to help us understand why this example is being used.
213000	217000	Like for example, when you study any subject, if you're a student of mathematics,
217000	219000	and there's a concept that's being explained,
219000	223000	right after the concept, here are the following examples.
223000	225000	And then solve the following problems.
225000	228000	So, they'll give you a couple of examples that they've solved for you,
228000	231000	and then you have to figure out the rest to solve yourself.
231000	235000	Same way when I teach any subject, if I'm teaching Arabic for example, a grammar concept,
235000	239000	I'll give a couple of examples of it, then you can solve your own problems.
239000	243000	So, the idea of method here necessarily connects to what came before.
243000	245000	And that's really, really important.
245000	250000	The ayah right before said, you know, that Allah has favored us.
250000	255000	That is the favor of Allah. He gives it to whoever he wants.
255000	258000	And in the very next ayah, Allah is talking about the Israelites.
258000	262000	Why? Because the Israelites were favored by Allah already.
262000	265000	وَأَنْنِ فَبَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ
265000	267000	مَفَبَّلْلَهُمْ عَلَى الْعَلْمِينَ
267000	270000	وَآَتَيْنَهُمْ إِلَى الْعَيَاتِ مَا فِيهِ بَدَاءُمْ بُبِينَ
270000	272000	Multiple places in the Qur'an, Allah says,
272000	274000	I favored you over all other nations.
274000	277000	We favored them knowingly over other nations
277000	282000	and gave them all kinds of ayah in which there were great tests and great blessings.
282000	284000	This is what he says about the Israelites.
284000	287000	So, he just mentioned us getting fulbul.
287000	291000	And then he mentions the nation that used to have the fulbul.
291000	293000	As an example, why?
293000	300000	Because now that you're stepping up, you know, like to give you a baseball analogy,
300000	304000	when somebody's up to bat, it's their turn.
304000	309000	Right? But before you go up to bat, let me give you the example of the last guy who was in your place.
309000	311000	Here's the mistake they made.
311000	316000	The purpose of it is, you are now standing in the exact place that the Israelites were standing.
316000	325000	Which means, you are in potential danger of making the same mistakes that they made.
325000	327000	That's the point that's being made.
327000	335000	And this mindset really helps us appreciate why the word, you know,
335000	338000	the first word that's going to get used after an example is,
338000	348000	hummulu, the example of those who were given the burden, who were burdened or loaded with the Torah.
348000	351000	The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam, is told,
351000	353000	Inna salulki alaika kaulan saqila.
353000	356000	We are putting a heavy word on you.
356000	359000	The Quran is described as a heavy word.
359000	362000	What did we just learn about the Torah? They were given the burden of the Torah.
362000	367000	What does Allah say about the Quran? It is a heavy word put on the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam.
367000	373000	We ask Allah, at the end of Surat al-Baqarah, after learning about the Israelites in detail,
373000	375000	at the end of it, we say,
375000	379000	ربنا لا تحمد عدينة إسلن كما حملته على النذين من قبلنا.
379000	385000	Ya Allah, do not place a burden on us like you placed on those who came before us.
385000	388000	ربنا ولا تحملنا ما لا طاقت لنا به.
388000	393000	Our master do not put a burden on us that we have no power to bear.
393000	398000	So the word burden is now associated with the responsibility of carrying revelation.
398000	404000	We saw in the second ayah, يطلو عليهما ياته ويزكيهم ويعندي مهم الكتاب والحكمة.
404000	407000	And in the next ayah Allah described this as a fadhan.
407000	409000	This is a favor of Allah that you get to have the Quran.
409000	411000	Now there is the other side.
411000	418000	It's a privilege, fadhan, it's a privilege, but it's also a massive burden and massive responsibility.
418000	420000	And that's two sides of something.
420000	425000	Like for example, this takes us back also to al-Madik and Aziz,
425000	431000	when the king appoints someone as the advisor.
431000	433000	Isn't that a huge privilege?
433000	438000	But at the same time, a huge responsibility, right?
438000	444000	So the positions that have the highest privilege also come with the highest responsibility.
444000	447000	We respect people in high positions.
447000	451000	Actually we respect them because they have to carry high responsibilities.
451000	453000	That's what makes them respectable.
453000	454000	You see?
454000	457000	So your teacher is respected because he has higher responsibility.
457000	459000	The principal is more respected.
459000	463000	The dean of the university is even more respected because they're carrying higher and higher responsibilities.
463000	469000	Now we are privileged to have the Quran and we have the responsibility of the burden of carrying the Quran.
469000	474000	So it's important that now that you have this privilege, congratulations, that's the fadhah of Allah,
474000	481000	now you better watch out because this privilege will go away the moment you no longer carry your responsibility.
481000	484000	Like any job, you can have the most prestigious job,
484000	489000	but the moment you don't do justice with your job, you get humiliated.
489000	492000	You could have the job of the president, a really prestigious job,
492000	497000	and then you're corrupt in your role and you're the most humiliated person in the country
497000	499000	because you misuse that role.
499000	505000	So now that Muslims are in this position, they need to know what happened to people who were privileged before you
505000	507000	and they lost that privilege.
507000	509000	You don't want to fall into this position.
509000	513000	Look at these other ayat in the Quran that similarly allude to this concept.
520000	529000	If they turn away then the messenger is only responsible for the burden that was placed on him.
532000	535000	And you are only responsible for the burden that was placed on you.
535000	539000	When you are to follow him, you will be committed to guidance.
539000	546000	And the only obligation the messenger has is to communicate clearly.
546000	550000	Another ayat in the Quran, actually this is a scary one, but I'm going to...
550000	552000	You know what? Let me just tell it to you now.
557000	563000	We offered the trust to the skies and the earth and the mountains
563000	566000	and they all refused to carry the burden.
566000	569000	They all refused to carry the trust.
569000	574000	The trust is actually the choice to do right and wrong in Surat al-Ahzab.
574000	577000	And Allah is saying the choice to do right and wrong was...
577000	580000	Human beings were privileged with high intellect.
580000	583000	They were privileged with the soul, the Ruh that Allah blew inside them.
583000	587000	And as a result they have more power to make right choices than any other creature.
587000	592000	So when this power, this trust, that I'll let you make whatever choice you want,
592000	596000	when this trust was being handed to any other creation, they could not hold it.
596000	599000	But the human being decided to hold it.
599000	601000	And in the next ayat Allah says,
605000	610000	And it so ended up happening that Allah will end up punishing the hypocrites of the men and the women.
610000	612000	And the mushrikeen, men and women.
612000	614000	Who was mentioned first? Mushrikun or hypocrites?
614000	620000	Hypocrites are people who accept the responsibility, who have, who accept the religion,
620000	622000	and then play games with the religion.
622000	623000	Those are the hypocrites.
623000	628000	They were put on the responsibility first because they actually consciously took the responsibility.
628000	632000	Anyway, so that's a little bit about the notion of carrying the responsibility,
632000	635000	those who were given the load of carrying the Torah.
635000	638000	Before we go on, we should also learn some things about the word Torah.
638000	642000	The word Torah comes from the Hebrew language and is pronounced as Torah.
642000	645000	It is usually translated as law or instruction,
645000	649000	and is considered as the most sacred text in Judaism.
649000	652000	The Torah consists of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible,
652000	656000	Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy,
656000	660000	and includes God's instructions, guidance, and teachings for the Jewish people.
660000	664000	So generally speaking, the Torah refers to the Old Testament,
664000	666000	the five books of the Old Testament.
666000	672000	In Hebrew, it is from the root YAH-RAHA, which is similar to Arabic,
672000	677000	Wari actually, which has the primary meaning throw or shoot.
677000	682000	In the derived Haif-al form, Af-A'la form, the verb means to teach,
682000	685000	to throw knowledge towards someone else.
685000	690000	So from that, the noun Torah means direction or instruction.
690000	695000	So actually, Torah literally means instruction or law or direction.
695000	697000	That's what the word comes from.
697000	700000	Now, let me give you an example.
700000	702000	This is just an example. This is not what the Qur'an says.
702000	704000	I just want to explain a point to you.
704000	708000	Those who were charged with the Qur'an then didn't uphold it.
708000	713000	If I say that, those who were charged with the Qur'an and didn't uphold it,
713000	718000	is that a comment about all of those who were charged with the Qur'an
718000	721000	or some of those who were charged with the Qur'an?
721000	723000	Huh?
723000	729000	If you say all, then it means none of them upheld it.
729000	734000	If you say those who were charged with the Qur'an and didn't uphold it,
734000	736000	only these people.
736000	737000	So when Allah says,
737000	741000	مثل لذين فمل التورات ثم لم يفملها,
741000	747000	the example of those who were charged with the Torah and didn't uphold it,
747000	750000	is that all the Jews are some of the Jews.
750000	752000	Do you understand the point?
752000	755000	There are those who were given the Torah that upheld it.
755000	757000	Allah talks about them.
757000	761000	There were those that were given the Torah that lived by it and died by it.
761000	763000	And there are heroes. They're talked about in the Qur'an too.
763000	766000	This example, see what happens sometimes is
766000	770000	people want to find, oh, the Qur'an is anti-Semitic
770000	772000	or the Qur'an is anti-Jewish.
772000	774000	Actually, it's pretty pro-Jewish.
774000	776000	More Jewish prophets are mentioned,
776000	779000	more Israelite prophets are mentioned than any other nation's prophets in the Qur'an.
779000	782000	Musa A.S. has mentioned over 70 times in the Qur'an.
782000	784000	Right?
784000	789000	And one of the noble prophets that even our prophet is supposed to take inspiration from.
789000	793000	But the most important piece here is Allah does not only criticize the Jews
793000	796000	and He does not only praise the Jews and He does not only...
796000	801000	There's no only. There's in specific cases, specific case studies are mentioned.
801000	805000	This is a case study of those who were charged with the Torah and didn't live up to it.
805000	808000	Now, let's understand what does it mean to be charged with the Torah?
808000	814000	It actually means those who studied it, those who learned it, the scholars among them.
814000	819000	And again, not all scholars among them, some scholars among them
819000	822000	who after having learned it did not live up to it.
822000	824000	They did not live up to it.
824000	827000	Hum Mila also is a passive verb, which I'll explain in a second.
827000	832000	Now, because there's a lot of work to do today on this,
832000	835000	I want to first get through our understanding.
835000	838000	How does the Qur'an explain this concept?
838000	842000	When He says they didn't live up to the Torah, they didn't carry it.
842000	844000	Well, how does He explain that they didn't carry it?
844000	846000	I'm going to go through a number of ayat.
846000	849000	This is not comprehensive, but it should give you a pretty decent idea.
849000	852000	What I want you to keep in your mind is the first thing I said.
852000	855000	Why is this example being given? For whose benefit?
855000	862000	Ours. So every mistake of theirs is potentially whose mistake?
862000	866000	It's ours. We have to have a really good look at ourselves as we read this.
866000	867000	First,
868000	877000	The worst pits of hell are for those who wrote the law with their own hands
877000	879000	and then said, this is from Allah.
879000	883000	So they can make some small, cathetic profit from it.
883000	885000	They toyed with the law of Allah.
886000	889000	So,
889000	892000	then terrible hell is for them because of what their hands wrote
892000	896000	and terrible hell is for them because of what they keep on earning.
896000	900000	So the first thing is to come up with laws and fatwas and rulings
900000	904000	and then say this is actually from Allah, but do it for corrupt reasons.
904000	906000	That'd be genuine.
909000	913000	You will see a huge population among them that make a lot of efforts
914000	918000	to spread animosity and sin.
918000	921000	They want to spread harm and animosity, hate.
923000	928000	And they want to eat corrupt food, meaning they want to eat from illegitimate means,
928000	933000	haram means, through cheating, through lying, through stealing, through robbery.
933000	937000	They are making terrible their behaviors have been.
937000	941000	And the Jews said,
942000	945000	Allah's hands are tied.
945000	947000	Allah's hands are tied.
947000	949000	May their hands be tied.
949000	952000	And they should be cursed because of what they said.
952000	954000	Now, what does it mean Allah's hands are tied?
954000	956000	Where's Allah? Allah's not doing anything.
956000	958000	Why is this happening to us?
958000	961000	Why is this, why is his hands tied?
961000	963000	Where was Allah when I had a car accident?
963000	965000	Where was Allah when I lost my job?
965000	968000	Where was Allah when this happened in this country and that happened in that country?
968000	970000	Where was, what are they trying to say?
970000	972000	Allah's hands are tied.
972000	975000	Alhamdulillah, we don't do that.
975000	976000	Oops.
976000	977000	But
977000	982000	He spends how he wants.
982000	983000	Well,
987000	989000	Watch this and a good number of them,
989000	997000	what has been sent to you from your rub makes them even more rebellious and more, more, more disbelieving.
997000	999000	Meaning they get offended by the word of Allah.
999000	1010000	And we have put animosity and hatred between them for each other until judgment day.
1010000	1017000	Every time they try to start a new fire of war, Allah puts it out.
1017000	1024000	They make all kinds of efforts to create corruption in the land, in the region.
1024000	1029000	Allah does not love those who cause corruption.
1029000	1036000	They even killed prophets.
1036000	1037000	Allah says,
1043000	1045000	Every time a prophet would come to them,
1045000	1048000	a messenger would come telling them something they don't want to hear,
1048000	1051000	either they called him a liar or they got him killed.
1051000	1054000	Well, we don't have any more prophets after Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam,
1054000	1060000	but we have people that would invite people or educate people about what the prophet taught,
1060000	1065000	what the Book of Allah taught, and sometimes we don't want to hear what the Book of Allah says.
1065000	1069000	So what did we do with certain people that were saying this is what Allah says?
1069000	1076000	We would either call them liars, humiliate them, disgrace them, or even get them killed.
1076000	1081000	There were many great scholars of Islamic history that were jailed, beat, tortured, killed, humiliated,
1081000	1085000	and many of them even today, people say lots of lies against them.
1085000	1086000	I'm not afraid to say it.
1086000	1092000	I think Imam Abu Hanifa r.a is one of the most lied about people in Islamic history.
1092000	1096000	Like even people who like him lie about him, don't even know.
1096000	1100000	Like there's so much wrong done with certain people in our history and he's one of those people.
1100000	1103000	He's one of the Muslim-mean in Islamic history.
1103000	1105000	Honest to God.
1105000	1114000	And there's just, he was such a remarkable figure and then later on the worst things were associated with him.
1114000	1119000	And you know how sometimes, I'll give you an analogy, sometimes you go to some people's house,
1119000	1121000	they insult you nicely.
1121000	1123000	You know what I'm talking about?
1123000	1126000	Oh, Mashallah, you still have the same job, huh?
1129000	1131000	Hey, you still driving that Toyota?
1131000	1132000	Cool.
1132000	1134000	Yeah, I remember.
1134000	1137000	Does it still have the same scratches?
1137000	1140000	Are those people who insult you nicely?
1140000	1144000	There's a lot of people who insult the scholars of the past nicely.
1144000	1147000	May Allah reward him, Mashallah.
1147000	1151000	And then they'll still all catalyze about.
1151000	1155000	And this, this is for the Fariqah and Kebzabu and Fariqah and Yakturun.
1155000	1157000	They would kill prophets.
1157000	1159000	They would lie against prophets.
1159000	1161000	We don't, Alhamdulillah, there's no more prophets.
1161000	1164000	But the next best thing is the ambassador of the prophets.
1164000	1166000	Who are the ambassadors of the prophets?
1166000	1168000	The scholars.
1168000	1172000	So the ones who, among them, who did speak the truth, they, you, you didn't want to hear what they have to say,
1172000	1175000	because what happened with the Israelites where they were living under kingdoms
1175000	1180000	and so their religious hierarchy was associated with the government.
1180000	1183000	So if a scholar came and said something the government didn't want to hear,
1183000	1190000	then he would put the, his payroll scholars to go after the scholar that's not on the payroll and annihilate him.
1190000	1192000	If that wasn't enough, get them killed.
1192000	1194000	Get rid of them all together.
1194000	1196000	You know? Throw them in jail. Do this to that.
1196000	1199000	So this is Fariqah and Kebzabu and Fariqah and Yakturun.
1199000	1202000	Ka'nu la'yatanaahuna an munkarin fa'aloo. This is scary.
1202000	1206000	They didn't use to stop each other from bad things that they did.
1206000	1208000	They just didn't let it happen and just say,
1208000	1211000	what can I do? There's just us, who they are, is who they do.
1211000	1213000	They wouldn't even say anything bad about it.
1213000	1216000	La bisa ma ka'nu ya fa'aloo, what a terrible thing they were doing.
1216000	1218000	Meaning, not only were the bad people doing something bad,
1218000	1221000	the people that were standing and watching were also doing something terrible.
1221000	1223000	Just becoming bystanders.
1223000	1228000	Ya ayyu an ladinaa manoo la tasalua an asyaa, entubdala kum tasaukum.
1228000	1233000	Those of you who have faith, don't ask about things that if you find out about them,
1233000	1235000	they will hurt you.
1235000	1239000	Wa entasalua anhaa hayda yu-razaan mukr'aan, tubdala kum, a'fa allahu anhaa.
1239000	1243000	And if you ask about them, when the Quran is still coming down,
1243000	1246000	they will be made clear to you, Allah has forgiven certain things.
1246000	1248000	Meaning, if Allah didn't talk about something,
1248000	1252000	if Allah didn't say this is halal or this is haram, He didn't discuss the issue.
1252000	1256000	That's not because Allah didn't remember to discuss the issue.
1256000	1260000	It's because whatever He doesn't mention, He has forgiven.
1260000	1262000	That's what Allah is saying, a'fa allahu anhaa.
1262000	1264000	Allah has already forgiven it.
1264000	1266000	But what do people want to know?
1266000	1268000	Can you tell me about this? Can you tell me about this?
1268000	1269000	Can you tell me about this?
1269000	1273000	Musa A.S. told the people, slaughter a cow.
1273000	1275000	Easy, slaughter a cow.
1275000	1277000	What is it? No, a cow will cover cow.
1277000	1281000	How big, how tall, how fat, skinny, you know, it's still confusing.
1281000	1285000	And the more questions they asked, the answer became easier and more difficult.
1285000	1288000	So who created the difficulty?
1288000	1291000	Their questions created the difficulty.
1291000	1292000	Their questions created the difficulty.
1292000	1294000	And He says, Allah says,
1299000	1302000	There were people before you that used to ask a lot of questions
1302000	1305000	on creating more and more complications.
1305000	1307000	And because of it, they became disbelievers.
1307000	1310000	Because of their questions, they became disbelievers.
1310000	1313000	Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.
1313000	1316000	Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you
1316000	1318000	that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com
1318000	1322000	and help other sign up, even sponsor students for bayinatv.com
1322000	1326000	so we can create worldwide communities of students that are studying the meanings
1326000	1328000	and the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran
1328000	1330000	and are insha'Allah, spreading that in their own circles.
1330000	1331000	Thanks so much.
1331000	1334000	Because of their questions, they became disbelievers.
1334000	1339000	So that's one, you know, it's not like you're not allowed to ask questions.
1339000	1341000	Of course, you're allowed to ask questions.
1341000	1345000	But when you're trying to split hairs, you know,
1345000	1350000	and get into nitty gritty details, details on top of details on top of details,
1350000	1354000	complicating things more than they need to be complicated, you know,
1354000	1358000	then you're just creating, you're making the religion so difficult
1358000	1361000	that you can't even practice it.
1361000	1362000	It will become impossible.
1362000	1363000	Okay.
1363000	1366000	So now another disease that they used to have.
1366000	1368000	You were the people from Mahantum Ha'udah,
1368000	1372000	Takhtulun Anfusakum Wa Toqriyuna Fariqa Minkum Min Diyaarihim.
1372000	1376000	You were the same people who used to kill each other.
1376000	1379000	They were Muslims, killing other Muslims.
1379000	1382000	But then, and then you were killing, you were expelling them,
1382000	1384000	your own people from your own homes,
1384000	1387000	and you were taking over each other's properties,
1387000	1389000	T'allah Aruna Aalaihim Bilal I.
1389000	1392000	You were making aggressive moves against each other,
1392000	1395000	invading each other's properties, taking each other's land and things like that.
1395000	1398000	But then after you fought each other,
1398000	1402000	by the way, when the Muslims fought each other, they became weak.
1402000	1405000	If a family is having fights within itself, the family is weak,
1405000	1408000	which means it's easier to attack from the outside.
1408000	1412000	So when the Israelites fought each other, other nations saw that they're weak.
1412000	1414000	So they started invading them.
1414000	1416000	When they invaded them, many of them became slaves.
1416000	1420000	Then they would have fundraisers, our Muslim brothers are being tortured.
1420000	1423000	Please, raise some money so we can free our Muslim brothers.
1423000	1425000	Wa In Ya'atukum Musaara Tufaduhum
1425000	1429000	When they come to you as slaves, you go and pay money to rescue them.
1429000	1431000	You want to raise money for that cause.
1431000	1434000	Wa Wa Mu'harramun Aalaikum Ikhrajuhum
1434000	1437000	Kicking them out of their homes in the first place was haram for you.
1437000	1440000	You created a conflict that led them to become this way,
1440000	1444000	and then you want to come and rescue them. This is what Tufrah says.
1444000	1448000	The first was the infighting, and then there was a whole help your fellow brother.
1448000	1451000	This hypocrisy was created within them.
1451000	1453000	Okay, then,
1453000	1456000	Ifa Tugliluna Bi Ba'ud Lil Kitabi Wa Takt Furuna Bi Ba'ud
1456000	1461000	Do you believe in some parts of the book and just completely reject other parts of the book?
1461000	1464000	Fa Maa Jazaa'u Ma Ya'f'alu Dhalika
1464000	1468000	Inlaa Khizyul Fi Al Hayatul Dunyaa
1468000	1471000	What could be the payback for someone who does something like that,
1471000	1473000	except they should be humiliated in this light?
1473000	1475000	They should live in humiliation.
1475000	1478000	Wa Yaumal Qiyamati Yuradunaylaa Shadil Adab
1478000	1482000	In the Day of Resurrection, they will be taken back to the worst of punishments.
1482000	1486000	Oh, this one's scary. Wa Qaalul Qulubuna Wulf
1486000	1490000	They said, our hearts are wrapped up.
1490000	1494000	Our hearts are safe, no matter what.
1494000	1498000	As bad as I am, I still have iman in my heart.
1498000	1501000	It doesn't matter how... Okay, ya, this is haram, this is haram, this is haram.
1501000	1504000	I do a lot of haram, but I'm a good person.
1504000	1507000	In my heart, I'm still a good person.
1507000	1510000	You should know that. Don't judge my heart.
1510000	1512000	My heart is still good.
1512000	1513000	O' Allah says,
1513000	1515000	Allaahubu'Allah bi Kufrihim
1515000	1517000	Allah crush them because they're denial.
1517000	1520000	Fa Qalilam Ma Ya'yut Bilun. How little they have faith.
1520000	1522000	This way of saying, ya, ya, ya, I'd shut.
1522000	1527000	You're right, I do a lot of bad things, but I'm not that bad because deep down inside...
1527000	1530000	Deep down, really deep down.
1530000	1534000	Wa Lammaa Jaaahum Kitabubin A'indil Nahi Musaddikul Dima Maaahum
1534000	1537000	And when they would make predictions of the future,
1537000	1541000	that when the final prophet comes, you will see,
1541000	1543000	Oh, it's gonna be awesome. We're gonna win.
1543000	1545000	Ah, that sounds familiar.
1545000	1550000	When the signs of judgment take come, then the Muslims are gonna...
1550000	1553000	Right now though, my heart's in a good place.
1553000	1558000	Wa Qalilam Min Kumli Astaftihaun A'adil Adha Bina Qafal. Okay.
1558000	1561000	Allah says to them, Listen.
1561000	1563000	He holds the mountain above them.
1563000	1565000	He scares them and says,
1565000	1567000	Hold on to what I'm giving you with might.
1567000	1569000	Wa Saba'u, Listen.
1569000	1571000	Qa'udu Sama'ana Wa As-Sina.
1571000	1573000	They say, We heard and we disobeyed.
1573000	1575000	You know what this is? Let me tell you.
1575000	1577000	Sometimes Allah scares people.
1578000	1580000	He puts them in a very scary situation.
1580000	1584000	And in that scary situation, they realize they must obey Allah.
1584000	1586000	And soon after that scary situation,
1586000	1589000	when the scary situation is gone, what happens to those people?
1589000	1592000	They're gonna...
1592000	1594000	Allah's not mad anymore.
1594000	1597000	I think I can go back to normal now.
1597000	1600000	Like Allah gives the analogy of even non-believers,
1600000	1603000	you know, when they're traveling by sea and the sea becomes turbulent,
1603000	1605000	they all start remembering Allah.
1605000	1609000	Right? If you're on a plane and the medical mouth mask falls.
1609000	1611000	Right?
1616000	1618000	Oops, sorry.
1618000	1620000	The pilot fell asleep.
1620000	1622000	You can put the medical mouth mask back up.
1622000	1625000	Okay, well, I'll go back to Netflix then.
1628000	1629000	Right?
1629000	1630000	So there's a...
1630000	1633000	And the idea here is actually even more than that.
1633000	1635000	They were shaken up and they were told,
1635000	1638000	listen to what we are giving you seriously.
1638000	1640000	And hold on to it.
1640000	1643000	And they said, we hear, but later on, even though they heard it,
1643000	1645000	they still disobeyed.
1645000	1647000	And then Allah says, has a punishment.
1647000	1649000	This is a punishment from Allah when people hear the word of Allah
1649000	1654000	and they don't care that Allah puts the love of filthy things in their hearts.
1654000	1655000	He says,
1658000	1661000	You know, they ended up loving the worship of a cow.
1661000	1663000	And they were obsessed with it.
1663000	1665000	Where did that filthy love come from?
1665000	1666000	It's shirk.
1666000	1667000	You're a Muslim.
1667000	1668000	How could you just do shirk like that?
1668000	1673000	That's the punishment of hearing the word of Allah after being shaken up
1673000	1674000	and still dismissing it.
1674000	1678000	Well, you want to dismiss it, then Allah does not reside in your heart.
1678000	1679000	Then you...
1679000	1681000	He'll allow that heart to be flooded with all kinds of shirk
1681000	1683000	and creepy weird practices.
1683000	1686000	And you'll find, I don't have to spell this out to you,
1686000	1689000	but there's no shortage of weird shirk-y,
1689000	1693000	total idol worship type practices across the Muslim world.
1693000	1697000	Total idol worship type, like crazy, and they call themselves Muslim.
1697000	1700000	And they do the most like non-Muslim things.
1700000	1701000	Openly.
1701000	1705000	I was told that I promised to stop my worship
1705000	1707000	but most of them made a promise breaking.
1707000	1710000	Every time they made any promise, they threw it away.
1710000	1712000	They couldn't keep any promises.
1712000	1715000	I learned this the hard way in Pakistan.
1715000	1717000	I thought things would get better.
1717000	1719000	You know what I learned about Islam?
1719000	1721000	When somebody says, don't worry about it at all.
1721000	1722000	Done.
1722000	1723000	Take care.
1723000	1725000	That's when you should worry.
1725000	1729000	When the guy says,
1729000	1731000	I'm thinking about it, I don't know.
1731000	1734000	Oh my God.
1734000	1739000	The more guarantees, the more guarantees,
1739000	1741000	the more lies.
1741000	1742000	Why?
1742000	1743000	Why?
1743000	1745000	Allah says every time they made any promise,
1745000	1746000	they threw it behind their back.
1746000	1749000	I was speaking to a senior in Pakistan intellectual,
1749000	1750000	became a friend of mine.
1750000	1752000	I love making friends with elders.
1752000	1753000	They're just so wise.
1753000	1756000	He said, you know what our problem is in our country?
1756000	1759000	We're just in the habit of lying about the smallest things.
1759000	1761000	We just have to lie.
1761000	1763000	We don't even have, there's no reason.
1763000	1764000	We still do it.
1764000	1765000	We still do it.
1765000	1771000	You're like, your friend is waiting for you at the door, right?
1771000	1773000	And he calls you and says, you coming?
1773000	1775000	You could say, I need five minutes.
1775000	1777000	You say, no, no, I'm already down the stairs.
1777000	1778000	I'm right there, bro.
1778000	1779000	I'm right there.
1779000	1781000	Just 10 seconds, 10 minutes later.
1781000	1782000	Right?
1782000	1787000	There was no reason to lie, but you still have to do it.
1787000	1788000	You know?
1788000	1791000	Hey, have you finished the Saim-e-Dalagi-Bu?
1791000	1792000	Alhamdulillah.
1797000	1799000	You guys are unrelated, Alhamdulillah.
1799000	1800000	I wasn't related to what you said.
1800000	1802000	I was just saying praise the Lord to Allah.
1802000	1806000	Then here's the other scary one.
1806000	1817000	You will find them the most desiring of living.
1817000	1819000	They just want to live.
1819000	1821000	They just don't want to die.
1821000	1824000	Even more than the people who do shirk.
1824000	1827000	Each one of them wants to live a thousand years.
1827000	1829000	You know how this is a new one.
1829000	1831000	I didn't think this would happen to us, but a lot of people
1831000	1834000	Muslims come up to me, young and old.
1834000	1836000	I have a real fear of dying.
1836000	1838000	I just don't want to die.
1838000	1839000	Why do you lucky death?
1839000	1840000	I have nightmares about dying.
1840000	1842000	Why are you afraid of dying?
1842000	1844000	We came from Allah.
1844000	1846000	We return back to Allah.
1846000	1847000	This is an episode of our life.
1847000	1849000	This is not the end of our life.
1849000	1854000	I met a doctor who told me he deals with patients that are on the verge of death.
1854000	1855000	You know?
1855000	1858000	And sometimes he has to tell the family he only has a month left.
1858000	1860000	He has two weeks left.
1860000	1864000	If you'd like to take him off the machine and take them home or whatever,
1864000	1868000	take them off dialysis, etc., then it's your choice.
1868000	1874000	And he says, man, I deal with atheist families, Jewish families, Christian families, Hindu families,
1874000	1876000	all kinds of Muslim families.
1876000	1879000	And the only families to say, no, no, no, he cannot die.
1879000	1880000	He cannot die.
1880000	1881000	Keep him on the machine.
1881000	1882000	I know his brain is not working anymore.
1882000	1884000	But no, no, no, that cannot be.
1884000	1885000	We cannot have him die.
1885000	1888000	The only families that do that are the Muslim families.
1889000	1891000	Everybody else says he had a good life.
1891000	1892000	The atheist says I had a good life.
1892000	1893000	Let me go in peace.
1893000	1896000	They have no problem.
1896000	1898000	The Hindu says, okay, I'll come back.
1898000	1899000	Karma, I'll come back.
1899000	1901000	Patelliteb, whatever, I'll come back.
1901000	1908000	The only people now that cannot accept the notion of death, how could this happen?
1908000	1909000	How could death happen?
1909000	1911000	No, no, no, they're still alive.
1911000	1912000	They can't go.
1912000	1913000	They can't go.
1913000	1915000	And they can't accept it over and over again.
1915000	1917000	You know what Allah did with us?
1917000	1923000	We don't hand the body over to a cremation company so they can deal with it.
1923000	1927000	Or to a company that embalms the body or who washes the body?
1927000	1929000	The family members.
1929000	1932000	Who puts the coffin on the body?
1932000	1933000	The family members.
1933000	1936000	Traditionally, who put the body in the grave?
1936000	1938000	The family, why?
1938000	1944000	Because Allah's, this religion teaches you to deal with death, not run from it to deal with it.
1944000	1949000	These realites developed a terrible fear of death.
1949000	1951000	Terrible fear of death.
1951000	1958000	It's reminding me of a hadith of the Prophet Salli Shalim when he said that people are going to eat from us like wolves, tear up a sheep.
1958000	1963000	And he said, what's the, when he was asked, Malmalja, how are we going to get out of this?
1963000	1965000	He said, remember death a lot, right?
1965000	1968000	And that's some people look at that and say, why shouldn't I remember death a lot?
1968000	1969000	It's depressing.
1969000	1973000	The point of that hadith is people will become so obsessed with what?
1973000	1978000	Life that they don't want to accept the reality of death.
1978000	1980000	It's not that you should wake up and say, I'm going to die.
1980000	1982000	Breakfast, I'm going to die.
1982000	1984000	You're going to have lunch, I'm going to die.
1984000	1986000	That's not what's being said.
1986000	1991000	It's just that you're so engulfed in life that you're denying the reality of death.
1991000	1993000	You're denying that this life is a journey.
1993000	1996000	And this was something that they before us, you know,
1996000	2004000	they're not going to be getting away from punishment if they no longer how much, how long they live.
2004000	2006000	Here's another one that they did.
2006000	2008000	They had this problem. Alhamdulillah.
2008000	2012000	We don't have this problem anywhere in the Muslim world.
2012000	2014000	You're alimuna nasa siha.
2014000	2018000	They used to teach people, the angels were sent to teach them magic.
2018000	2020000	And they were told when you learn magic,
2020000	2025000	if you learn this, you'll become kafir.
2025000	2027000	And they would learn things that would cause them harm.
2027000	2029000	You mayu farraqoola bihi bayin al-lalhi was a uji.
2029000	2034000	They would especially learn magic that would cause marriages to break up or a proposal to not go through.
2034000	2036000	Or this girl should never get married.
2036000	2039000	Or that guy should become sick before his engagement happens.
2039000	2044000	Or this is what they, this is where a lot of the magic industry went with them.
2044000	2046000	Alhamdulillah, we don't do that.
2046000	2048000	We're good.
2048000	2052000	Wa-lāhum bi-dhāri nabihī min-ahadil l-lābīdilā.
2052000	2056000	You couldn't be harming anybody with this kind of stuff except by Allah's permission.
2056000	2059000	Wa-yate'allam ulamayyaduruhum alayyamfa'uhum.
2059000	2062000	And they would only learn something that would harm them and not benefit them.
2062000	2065000	Wa-lābīt samāsharul bihi anfusahum.
2065000	2068000	Wa-lāqad alimu lamanishtara'um ala'u fil-ākhirati min-khadā'a.
2068000	2071000	And they knew whoever uses any of this or tries to do any of this
2071000	2074000	will have no portion in the akhira.
2074000	2076000	What a horrible thing they sold themselves for.
2076000	2081000	If they only knew, lo kan li'alam.
2081000	2086000	Min-adadīnahadu yuharrifūn al-kalīmā amma wādi'i.
2086000	2093000	Among the Israelites, the Jews, there are some who remove the word from its place.
2093000	2096000	Allah says one thing, they say, no, that's not what it means, this is what it means.
2096000	2099000	That's not what it says, this is what it says.
2099000	2100000	Messing with the words.
2100000	2104000	Now with the Qur'an, we can't change the word of Allah, right?
2104000	2105000	Here's a creative exercise.
2105000	2107000	Okay, we can't change the words.
2107000	2110000	Let's just tell people, I know this is what it says,
2110000	2115000	but it says X, but what it really means is Y.
2115000	2117000	I know it says X, I know, I know.
2117000	2120000	I know Allah is the best speaker, and he's very clear in his speech.
2120000	2123000	But what this really means is something else.
2123000	2128000	Or, oh, this is what the ayah is, but no, no, no, this ayah, we don't know how to follow this ayah.
2128000	2130000	We have to follow this ayah.
2130000	2132000	What?
2132000	2134000	Yuharrifūn al-kalīmā amma wādi'i.
2134000	2136000	Yakūluna sama'ina wa'a'asayna.
2136000	2137000	And they say, we hear and we disobey.
2137000	2139000	Wasma'a ghayla wa'sma'in.
2139000	2141000	And we hear in a way that shouldn't be heard.
2141000	2144000	Wa ra'ina layyam bi'a'asinati.
2144000	2147000	Meaning they twist their tongue and make insults.
2147000	2148000	Ta'anan fiddīn.
2148000	2150000	They are sarcastic in the matter of religion.
2150000	2152000	Wa qalū an'ahu wa la'u an'ahu.
2152000	2153000	Wa la'u an'ahu wa'sma'u an'ahu.
2153000	2154000	Wa'sma'u an'ahu wa'sma'u an'ahu.
2154000	2157000	And if they had only heard and obeyed, wa'sma'u an'ahu wa'sma'u an'ahu.
2157000	2159000	And had listened and said, wait for us.
2159000	2161000	La qāna khayran la'u an'ahu wa'a'ahu.
2161000	2164000	There would have been better for them.
2164000	2166000	They, okay, here's the next one.
2166000	2171000	Again, something, al-ḥamdu liLlāh, we are immune.
2171000	2176000	They, he says, and you know, he says,
2176000	2179000	ma yawaddu lladheena kafurumil an'al kitā'u wa l-al-mushinkīn
2179000	2181000	an'u nazzala aalaykum min khayri'ma rabbikum.
2181000	2185000	They never want that something good should come to you.
2185000	2188000	They hate that something good should come to you.
2188000	2190000	Wa la'u yashtasubi r-rahmati himayyasha.
2190000	2195000	And the knowledgeable among them hate that you now have revelation.
2195000	2198000	Meaning they feel like if you have knowledge of revelation,
2198000	2200000	then people are not going to come to us.
2200000	2202000	They're not going to be impressed with our knowledge now
2202000	2204000	because you have that knowledge.
2204000	2207000	So they don't want that for you.
2207000	2212000	Muslims within each other, you know, even in the Islamic space.
2212000	2214000	Even in the Islamic space.
2214000	2216000	You know, sometimes you can learn something good
2216000	2218000	from someone who knows a lot less than you.
2218000	2221000	Is that possible? Right?
2221000	2225000	But you notice that sometimes there's somebody who knows a lot more
2225000	2227000	and someone who knows a lot less.
2227000	2231000	But the one who knows a lot less is a lot more popular.
2231000	2232000	Yeah?
2232000	2235000	And the one who knows a lot more gets really upset.
2235000	2238000	But the guy who knows a lot less is more popular.
2238000	2241000	And maybe he says some wrong things, whatever he says.
2241000	2243000	But does he say something good also?
2243000	2245000	Yeah, he said me, this is something good.
2245000	2247000	Now, when you can do two things, you could say,
2247000	2250000	Hey, mashā'Allah, you're popular, you're reaching a lot of people.
2250000	2254000	Here are some mistakes you're making. Let me help you with them privately.
2254000	2257000	Because you care about this person and the good that they do.
2257000	2259000	But is that what we do?
2259000	2264000	Let me now, because I'm less popular, let me now announce to the world
2264000	2269000	how wrong this person is and highlight all of the wrong that they do.
2269000	2273000	And then tell people, yeah, there's some good things, mashā'Allah.
2273000	2274000	But you know what?
2274000	2278000	Those good things don't count for anything because look at all these wrongs.
2278000	2280000	Look at all these mistakes.
2280000	2285000	They cannot stand that something good might come from someone else.
2285000	2286000	You can't.
2286000	2289000	What is, you know, our religion has very simple principles.
2289000	2292000	If I have a problem with someone, what should I do?
2292000	2295000	Talk about them or talk to them?
2295000	2296000	Talk to them.
2296000	2298000	Our religion has very simple principles.
2298000	2304000	Hide the faults of your brother and sister or broadcast the faults of your brother and sister.
2304000	2306000	What is it?
2306000	2312000	Whoever covers a believer, Allah covers them on judgment day.
2312000	2317000	A lot of our Islamic content now is dedicated to one person destroying another person.
2317000	2318000	Yes or no?
2318000	2322000	My question is, that person who wanted to destroy that other person,
2322000	2327000	couldn't email them, couldn't find their phone number, couldn't go to their masjid,
2327000	2331000	couldn't go to their, didn't have a conversation with them, couldn't sit and talk, they couldn't do that.
2331000	2334000	They had to go to the world first and say what a kafir they are first.
2334000	2336000	That was step one.
2336000	2337000	This is what I don't understand.
2337000	2341000	There's one thing that you, you know, at least you talk to the person.
2341000	2344000	You talk to them, you have a conversation with them.
2344000	2345000	You know?
2345000	2350000	And even on top of that, my own theory, you don't have to agree with this.
2350000	2352000	Human beings will always disagree with each other.
2352000	2356000	And no human being will ever be perfect.
2356000	2360000	You could spend your energy describing how wrong someone else is,
2360000	2364000	or you could spend your energy showing, doing something right.
2364000	2367000	You could, you decide where you want to put your energy.
2367000	2368000	You know?
2368000	2373000	Some people, some people's entire religion just becomes correcting someone else,
2373000	2375000	knocking somebody else down.
2375000	2376000	Right?
2376000	2379000	And if somebody else is actually doing something really terrible,
2379000	2382000	or it's a very wrong idea that they're spreading, you know what?
2382000	2386000	Ideas should be attacked.
2387000	2391000	The Quran teaches us to attack ideas, instead of attacking what?
2391000	2392000	People.
2392000	2396000	We become obsessed with attacking people, instead of ideas.
2396000	2401000	Now the thing is, when you attack a person, that person is made up of good ideas and bad ideas.
2401000	2405000	When you attack that person, you have refuted everything.
2405000	2409000	But if you attack ideas, then you are making everyone move up.
2409000	2410000	You're helping each other.
2410000	2412000	But this, this is not what they did.
2412000	2414000	They don't like that good would come to somebody else.
2414000	2416000	There's one last one.
2416000	2418000	Adhan has also been given.
2422000	2425000	They started believing nobody will enter Jannah except us.
2425000	2428000	These are the wishful thoughts.
2428000	2429000	How to burhanakum?
2429000	2430000	Bring your proof.
2430000	2432000	I'll say bring your proof.
2432000	2438000	Is there any ayah in the Quran that says nobody will enter Jannah except you people?
2438000	2442000	That Allah give us a guarantee that you and I are going to enter Jannah.
2442000	2443000	No.
2443000	2444000	He says,
2444000	2445000	koo an fusakum ba'aadikum nara.
2445000	2447000	Save yourselves and your families from the fire.
2447000	2448000	He says,
2448000	2451000	ya ayu an nadina amanu koo an fusakum ba'aadikum nara.
2451000	2452000	He didn't say,
2452000	2455000	ya ayu an nadina katharu koo an fusakum ba'aadikum nara.
2455000	2456000	He said,
2456000	2459000	those of you who believe, save yourselves and your families from the fire.
2459000	2460000	Wait.
2460000	2461000	No, no, no.
2461000	2462000	Bur believers.
2462000	2463000	We're already safe.
2463000	2466000	This should be said to those who don't believe.
2466000	2470000	The rest of you, save yourselves from the fire, because we are already on the safe side.
2470000	2475000	No, he says, those of you who believe, save yourselves and your families from the fire.
2475000	2476000	What does that tell you?
2476000	2479000	Believers don't have a false sense of security.
2479000	2486000	And because they don't have that, they're not, they don't have any mental energy to decide who is and isn't going to help.
2486000	2491000	They don't have energy for that, because they've got to worry about themselves.
2491000	2492000	They've got to worry about them.
2492000	2496000	How many people come to me and say, what's going to happen to Mother Teresa?
2497000	2499000	Is that your concern on Judgment Day, bro?
2499000	2506000	Like honestly, when we rise and you see the sun and the moon colliding with each other and the oceans boiling, you're like, where's Mother Teresa?
2510000	2515000	Well, are you honestly going to be the day on which a mother will drop her baby?
2516000	2519000	The day on which a person will run from their own family.
2519000	2522000	You're like, but I have a good coworker.
2522000	2525000	I'm just wondering if they're going to go to hell or not.
2527000	2529000	Why is this even your concern?
2529000	2531000	Do you not believe in Allah the just?
2531000	2534000	Do you not believe in Allah the knower of all things?
2534000	2540000	Do you not believe in Allah who understands the inside and the outside?
2540000	2543000	Why do you have to have an answer?
2543000	2549000	And if I say, if I help you out and say, you know what, your coworker, nice guy, yeah, Allah will put him in jannah.
2549000	2550000	You are not sure.
2552000	2554000	We're not even sure about ourselves, are we?
2555000	2557000	Then why do you want guarantees for someone else?
2557000	2559000	Where did this mentality come from?
2559000	2560000	It came from we're already saved.
2560000	2564000	I want other people to join the saved group.
2565000	2566000	This is self-righteousness.
2566000	2572000	Don't declare yourselves pure.
2572000	2574000	Don't declare yourself saved.
2574000	2576000	He knows better who has taqwa.
2576000	2578000	They developed this mentality.
2578000	2581000	And unfortunately, and we didn't even say, well, Muslims are saved.
2581000	2582000	We don't say that.
2582000	2585000	We say my version of Muslims are saved.
2585000	2595000	My people, my mentor, my sheikh, my whoever, and the people that wear the same uniform as me, wear the saved ones.
2595000	2597000	Everybody else, you know, they're just barbecued.
2601000	2604000	These, this is what, why do I go through all of these ayat?
2604000	2605000	Allah said what?
2605000	2609000	Those who were given the burden of the Torah and they didn't carry it.
2609000	2612000	They took the religion and made it into something else.
2613000	2614000	This is not what Allah gave.
2614000	2616000	They turned it into a different religion altogether.
2617000	2619000	And Allah says, this is this.
2619000	2622000	I'm giving you this example because now you have been privileged.
2622000	2624000	Don't make these mistakes.
2625000	2628000	And if we have been making these mistakes, enough of us, not all of us,
2628000	2630000	but enough of us have been making these mistakes,
2630000	2632000	now it's time we put a stop to it.
2633000	2636000	Now it's time we, you know, we have to study the Israelites
2636000	2639000	as we are studying ourselves, actually.
2640000	2641000	You know what, in medical school they do, right?
2641000	2643000	They study the cadaver, the dead body,
2644000	2646000	because they're actually studying the future patient.
2647000	2650000	We're studying the Israelites, not to study the Israelites.
2650000	2652000	We're studying them to study ourselves.
2652000	2655000	The Lord, that's what we're honest, but Allah's guidance for us.
2655000	2657000	Not fun facts from history.
2658000	2662000	So as I leave you, one of the, this is not where it gets things really cool.
2662000	2664000	I'll tell you at the end of after the prayer,
2664000	2666000	but one of the things I will share with you,
2666000	2670000	the example given was of a donkey that carries a burden.
2670000	2671000	Check this out.
2672000	2675000	One of the sages of the school of Eliyahu taught,
2675000	2678000	this is Jewish literature, the rabbinical literature.
2678000	2681000	This is the Babylonian Talmud.
2681000	2685000	A person should always make himself subjugated to matters of the Torah,
2685000	2689000	like an ox to a yoke, and like a donkey to a burden.
2690000	2694000	So the Torah actually said you should be committed to the book,
2694000	2698000	like a donkey is committed to the burden on it.
2698000	2701000	So they use this analogy to say,
2701000	2705000	this demonstrates how committed you should be to the book of Allah.
2705000	2708000	Allah took that image and reversed it and said,
2708000	2711000	yes, the analogy is true, but you actually became someone
2711000	2715000	who has no idea what it's carrying, like a donkey carrying a bunch of books.
2715000	2718000	The analogy is actually not originally Oran,
2718000	2722000	the analogy is actually taken from rabbinical literature
2722000	2725000	and being re-engineered to make this point.
2726000	2731000	So how Allah, okay, and then we'll discuss more of this after the Salat.
2731000	2734000	Barakallahu wa Alaykum, As-salamu alaykum wa rehmatullah.
2734000	2737000	Here's what's coming up in the next episode
2737000	2739000	and this deeper look of Surat al-Jumu'ah.
2739000	2744000	So the donkey that was trying to get rid of its burden ended up carrying even more.
2744000	2747000	Which is an interesting analogy because the Israelites,
2747000	2749000	they tried to play with the word of Allah
2749000	2753000	and the more they tried to play with it, life became more and more difficult for them.
2753000	2756000	The more complications came in their life.
2756000	2759000	Obeying the word of Allah makes life easy.
2759000	2762000	Disobeying the word of Allah makes life difficult.
2762000	2766000	That is the Quran's formula that's always been there since the beginning.
