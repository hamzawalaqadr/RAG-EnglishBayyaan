1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If I am just having way too much fun, way too much like money is good, entertainment is good, family of everything is set, everything is cruising, right?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's easy for me to forget that this life is temporary.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Maybe at that time a good reminder for me is I should be prepared for death and I shouldn't just associate this as my goal.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But my journey is a lot longer. You can get distracted easily.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Allah says it. When you have a lot of good things, they distract.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also. Thank you.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We are now up to ayah 6. Our goal today is to reach ayah number 8, which I think is an easy goal.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So we might not even need the entire time today, but I'm not going to go past ayah number 8. That's at least my assumption for today.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Today's subject is going to be really interesting.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
6, 7 and 8, all three ayah that we're going to be discussing have to do with death, which sounds very dark.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But actually it's an opportunity to discuss the Islam's take in Islam's philosophy on death, on life and death and how we view it, how we're supposed to think about that, not just philosophically and theologically,

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but what impact is that supposed to have on my day to day life?

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Death is a reality, but how much of that plays a role in the way that I live my life and my emotions, how I regulate myself on a day to day basis.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So let me just first begin with this ayah's translation and then inshallah we'll get into the work.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Qul, tell them. When you see Qul in the Quran, it's the Prophet ﷺ being told to speak to somebody directly.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So the Prophet ﷺ is being commanded to address this community.

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So Allah's now, the lessons so far were to the Muslims, but now there's a quick switch and now temporarily go talk to them also.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So the secondary audience became the primary audience temporarily.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, they became the primary audience.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And then right after that, they're going to become the secondary audience again and the primary audience will once again be the Muslims.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ya ayyuhadna zina amadu is coming in ayah number nine.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is an important piece of information because this tells us that the Quran was speaking to multiple audiences at the same time.

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Right? And when it's speaking to multiple audiences, like I'm talking to you, but they can hear me.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Right? Or I'm talking to them and they can hear me.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And then sometimes I switch over and talk to them directly while they can also hear.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Kind of like, you know, a parent when they're yelling at one child and the other kids are enjoying it.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And then they turn to the other one and they're like, your turn.

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You know, they switch to the other side.

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, but there is this kind of intifat.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's called intifat, switching from one audience to another audience.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And this is something that happens in the Quran very strategically.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And this is a lesbian showing us that in the in Medina, when the Quran was being recited and when it was being declared and publicly shared,

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that it wasn't just the Muslims that were listening and engaging with the Quran.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It was also actually the Jewish and Christian communities that were engaging with the Quran.

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And the Quran was actually telling the Prophet's life to engage them directly in dialogue.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was actually directly engaging. It's not just talking about them. It's talking to them.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And the Prophet is being instructed directly to engage with them, which is really interesting because there was a mentality that the scholars,

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
like there's their people of knowledge and they saw the the rest of the Arabs as these uneducated people who don't know how to read and write.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Right. So how can someone who's uneducated officially be debating with someone who is very well educated in their literature?

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Right.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's like it's like somebody who didn't even graduate from school debating with someone who has a PhD.

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right. And the scholarship of the Jewish community, the Israelites, their scholarship is actually called Ahbar in the Quran.

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Ahbar actually comes from the word Hebrew, which means ink.

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And because they wrote so much and because they read the leather that they stretched and they wrote on,

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
they read that so much and they put their finger on it so much, their hands would always have ink on them.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Smudged from the reading and the writing they did all the time.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And so they just got called people of ink because they're doing all this reading and writing all the time.

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I had the good fortune of making friends with a couple of rabbis and, you know, I hang out with them.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They shall not be named because they would rather remain anonymous.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Right. Which is cool. I get it.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So but when I talk to them, I am so impressed with the level of study that they do.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Like it's unbelievable how much study they do.

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I mean, one of the friends I know, he studied 14 years in their madrasa, like their religious school, 14 years,

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and then went to university and did a PhD, you know, another eight years.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And then after that, he still now studies an average of 10 hours a day.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is an average of 10 hours.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Like the amount that they study is staggering.

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's actually so impressive, you know.

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And this is their history.

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Their history is that of volumes and volumes and volumes and volumes of books.

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
These are people of a lot of learning.

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And now the Prophet, peace be upon him, was an ummi, which means doesn't read and doesn't write.

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And you didn't write this with your hands because you don't know how to write.

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's what the Prophet, the claim about the Prophet, is,

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
he's being told to go debate with them.

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why? How could that be possible?

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is actually the second episode where this is being done with the Israelites.

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The first episode that this was being done was with Jesus, with Isa, peace be upon him.

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And with Isa, peace be upon him, he went to the Israelite scholars and you would quote the Torah to them.

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Because Allah taught Isa, peace be upon him, the Torah and the Injeel.

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And you had the book, the wisdom, the Torah and the Injeel.

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And he didn't go to their schools to learn it.

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Allah revealed it over again to him.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So you can think of it as Torah was revealed to Musa, peace be upon him,

75
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and it was revealed again to Isa, peace be upon him.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So the original Torah, because it was changed so many times through history.

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So Jesus had it again.

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So he would quote them the Torah better than they knew after all of their scholarship.

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And we know in the Quran, we have something about Jesus that's not even in the biblical literature.

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Like he started speaking from the day he was born.

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So now, not just, this is ummi, meaning unlettered as if they came out of their child.

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He was literally ummi, like he just came out of his own.

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And he was already speaking to them, you understand?

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So this is a repeat of something that has happened before,

85
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
but the Prophet Isa, peace be upon him, is being told to challenge them with this divine knowledge.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And this also tells us something else about the nature of our religion.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If you know your book, if you know the scripture that Allah has revealed, the Quran,

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
then you don't have to be intimidated by the qualifications of someone.

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I can't talk to them about this because they have way too much, you know, too many degrees that I can't challenge.

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Because sometimes you'll find in a debate or a discussion, somebody might say,

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
oh yeah, what degree do you have?

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What qualifications do you have?

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And qualifications are about how many books have you read, right?

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
How many classes and courses have you taken?

95
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You know, how many courses of education have you completed from one degree to another, to another, to another?

96
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Which is all about knowledge, right?

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's all the more degrees you have, the more knowledge you have.

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But the Quran, interestingly, the Quran didn't emphasize knowledge as much as it emphasized thinking.

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So the Quran keeps saying, it doesn't constantly say,

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
don't you then know?

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It says,

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
don't you then think?

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So what's the difference between knowing and thinking?

104
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So I'll give you a quick example of this because this also goes back to

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and it goes back to that concept.

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And that is that, you know, everybody can watch the news.

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Everybody can watch the news.

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You can say, oh, this war started, or the price went up for gasoline, the price went up.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Or, you know, food prices went up or whatever.

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Anybody can see that.

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But there are some people who can see that and they know that that means that there's a ripple effect of this bit of news.

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And behind it, there's an entire story.

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And after it, there's an entire story.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And they can think through that.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's not just a bit of information, but they can analyze that information, right?

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You can study history.

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
In study and history, you can see this nation came, this empire came, that this empire came, that this empire came.

118
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But if somebody studies the philosophy of history, you know what they study?

119
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How do nations rise and how do nations fall?

120
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What, like they study the formula behind it, right?

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's actually thinking.

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's not just the information because, you know, even in school, sometimes you had to take a test.

123
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You had to memorize a bunch of information.

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And then when the test came, you just have to write the information that you memorized.

125
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So you had the knowledge, but you didn't have the thought, the thought process behind it, right?

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And by the way, some of the most boring subjects when you were younger are subjects like history, right?

127
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Literature, these are the boring subjects.

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't have to know all this.

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What's the point of it?

130
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Right?

131
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And then as you become older and wiser, you'll realize that those are some of the most important things that develop a person's understanding, right?

132
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Because then Akali is being applied.

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What the Prophet s.a.w. is teaching us is that it's not the degrees that make it intellectual.

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Actually, it's thinking that makes it intellectual.

135
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You can have someone in the desert that has never gone to a university who's a bigger intellectual than someone who has 20 degrees.

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And they've got all this information gathered up.

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I'm not saying those people can't be wise.

138
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Also, they can be, but I've met plenty of, I'm sorry to say this, but I've met plenty of PhDs that are stupid.

139
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I've met plenty of taxi drivers that dropped out of school in third grade that are very wise, that are extremely intellectual.

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's reality life, right?

141
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So here, all Ya'ayu and Nazeena hadu, you go say to them.

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The Prophet's being told, go address them.

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And then say what to them?

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ya'ayu and Nazeena hadu means those from the Jewish community.

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Ya'ayu and Nazeena hadu.

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The word hadu is interesting because it's a verb.

147
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If it was Ya'ayu and Yehud, and Yehud is the Jewish term also, right?

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And in some societies, this became a condescending term, but this is original.

149
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's a history behind the term.

150
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We'll look at that history in a second.

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But the word hadu is a verb.

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And it was used in Arabic.

153
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
According to Hamid al-Din Farahi, he argues that it was used in Arabic for those who belong to the Jewish community.

154
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So it was not a condescending term.

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It was actually used as a regular term.

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The verb in its original meaning in Arabic, hadayahudu actually means to repent, to make tawbah.

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Hadayahudu means to make tawbah.

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So Ya'ayu and Nazeena hadu actually means those who repented in the past also.

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It doesn't just mean those who were Jewish, but also means those who repented.

160
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hadaa also means to come back, those who went back, meaning those who went back to God.

161
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Which is actually another meaning of tawbah.

162
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Tawbah means to return back to Allah, as it does in it.

163
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So it says,

164
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you have the assumption that you are in fact close friends and protective friends to Allah,

165
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
as opposed to all other people,

166
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
then wish for death.

167
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If in fact you are truthful and solid in your claim.

168
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
These are the words that this is a word of translation of the ayah.

169
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The word hadaa also means to move gently, to move slowly and gently.

170
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So that's one of the side meanings of it.

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I just give it to you.

172
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But I want to read this to you because this is actually an excerpt from a book called Mufradatun Quran.

173
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Which means terms of the Quran, written by a remarkable scholar, Hamiduddin Farahi Rahimallah.

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He was an Indian scholar, but he had studied, he had traveled across the Arab world also.

175
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And he wrote books in which he specialized in what the Quran is saying and how that compares to the Torah.

176
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And he actually mastered Hebrew also.

177
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So he knew quite a bit of Hebrew.

178
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And he would comment on words in the Quran that are also found in the Torah and knew a comparative analysis of them.

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
One of his most amazing books is Arat Yusahiyeh, Timad-u-Zabih.

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
For those of you that can read Arabic, the correct position in who was to be slaughtered.

181
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Was it Ishmael that was to be slaughtered by the dream of Abraham?

182
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Or was it Isaac?

183
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Was it Ismael or Ishaq?

184
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Because Muslims have both opinions in our history.

185
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Some Muslims believe it was Ishaq, some Muslims believe it was Ismael.

186
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So he wrote a book about why he believes it's Ismael A.S.

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What's really cool about his book is the first argument is the Quran's argument.

188
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The second argument is the Torah's argument.

189
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And the third argument is from Jewish scholarship.

190
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Not even from Muslim scholarship, Jewish scholarship.

191
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And he shows demonstrably how it is actually Ismael A.S.

192
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That was supposed to be the one to be slaughtered.

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He proves it from all three.

194
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And then comes to that conclusion.

195
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But a very unique kind of writer.

196
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Anyway, so he talked about the word hadu because it has that biblical connotation.

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He says, hadayahudu haudantaba waraja'a.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This word means to repent and to go back.

199
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hikayaat an-du'a'i Musa A.S.

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This is also used in that way in the dua of Musa A.S.

201
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
which is in the Quran.

202
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Wa qtub lana fi hadihehid dunya hasana wasil aakhira.

203
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I actually read this to you from Surat al-A'raf.

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
A guarantee for us good in this life and in the next life.

205
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Inna hudna ilayka.

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Inna hudna ilayka from yawudu or hadayahudu is actually we come back to you.

207
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Meaning we repent to you.

208
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So the word is used in the meaning of repentance.

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Wa qalu wa aizan hada sarayahudiyan.

210
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And hada also means for someone to be Jewish.

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
To actually be Jewish.

212
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And it's also used in that way.

213
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
For example,

214
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
khunuhudana un-nasara.

215
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Haqadah tahuwada wa danika'a la taliqil arabiya.

216
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So the word tahuwada, for those of you that know a little bit of Arabic morphology, sarf,

217
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
tahuwada tanasara.

218
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So nasrani means Christian.

219
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Tanasara means to become Christian or to be Christian.

220
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Tahuwada means to be Jewish.

221
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So, kama yuqal tanasara bida nasraniya.

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Wa za'ama tta'inun thu qur'an.

223
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Anna haathith kala maqalima khata.

224
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And some critics believe that this word is a mistake in the Quran.

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Fa inna isma liyawud,

226
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
lesa maafuza min maddat haud.

227
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Balhwa nisba ilayyawudah.

228
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So, he says some people think this is a mistake in the Quran

229
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
because the word Jewish or the word yawudi or hada

230
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
is not about returning or repenting.

231
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It actually originally has to do with Judea

232
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
or Judah, actually Judah,

233
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
who is the fourth son of Jacob in the Bible.

234
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So, Jacob has 12 sons

235
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and the fourth son's name is Yahuda, actually, Yahuda.

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And that's in English or Latinized, it becomes Judah.

237
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And later on, instead of reading it, I'll summarize this for you,

238
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
later on the Jewish empire, from his children, by the way,

239
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
from the children of Judah, from Yaqub al-Azim,

240
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
eventually came Dawud al-Azim.

241
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And from Dawud al-Azim came Suleiman al-Azim.

242
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And Dawud al-Azim had a massive empire

243
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and so did Suleiman al-Azim.

244
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And that empire was called Judah, or Judea, actually, Yahuda.

245
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So, it was named after their forefather, which is the son of Yaqub.

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Eventually, the Israelites, they started fighting with each other.

247
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The believers of that time, the Muslims of that time,

248
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
they started fighting with each other

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and they broke that one nation into two nations,

250
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
much after Suleiman al-Azim.

251
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They broke it up into two nations called Judea and Israel.

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So, they're called Judea and Israel.

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And eventually, even those nations fell apart,

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
others came and invaded them.

255
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And when they invaded them, actually, let me read that part for you here.

256
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Did I click here? No, I didn't.

257
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, here it is.

258
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So, the fourth son of Yaqub, who was the fourth son of Yaqub,

259
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
was Dawud al-Azim.

260
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Dawud al-Azim was from this lineage.

261
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So, it became the second son of the Jewish nation,

262
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the Jewish nation of Israel,

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and the rest of the Israelites, the rest of the Israelites,

264
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and the rest of the Israelites,

265
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and then after that, the Sabbath and the Caldions,

266
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
the Caldions, they called them.

267
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You can look them up on Wikipedia.

268
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There was a Caldian empire, they came and they kind of destroyed

269
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
the Jewish empire and they broke it up.

270
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And now they saw all the Jews,

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
they didn't used to get called Jews before.

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The Judeans were the people that lived in the kingdom of Judea

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
or the descendants of Judah, you understand?

274
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But the enemy came and they just started calling all of the Israelites

275
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yerudi.

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And they didn't say Yerudi with Addaal,

277
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
they said Yerudi with Addaal.

278
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So, they changed it.

279
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And so, it started that way, this just became the new word for them.

280
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But it goes back to the fourth son of Yaqub al-Azim,

281
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
or historically you can say it refers to the time

282
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
where their empire started disintegrating.

283
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The Jewish empire started disintegrating

284
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and that's when this name became the common name.

285
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There's another interesting thing about this name.

286
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The Bible has the story of Yaqub and his family.

287
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Like you don't have the absolute Yusuf in the Quran.

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So, the Bible has the story of Yaqub and his wife

289
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and each one of his wives, like Lea and Rachel,

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and you know, he had two wives and two servants

291
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and he had children with all of them.

292
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And one of those Rachel's children are Joseph and Benjamin,

293
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
who we call what, Yusuf and Midyamin.

294
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But the other children, the way they have the story is that

295
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
every time a child was born, the mother, in this case Lea,

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
made a prayer. Right?

297
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, this is a mercy from God.

298
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Or God has granted this child and things like that.

299
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And so, she turns back to Allah and makes dua

300
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and when Judah was born,

301
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and she said the Hebrew version of Yahuza

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and that's why she named him that,

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
which actually has similar meaning to coming back to God

304
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
as a show of gratitude to God.

305
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So, what Allah does in the Quran when he says,

306
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Ya'u Yuhadna dhina hadu, he's actually,

307
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
he's killing two birds with one stone.

308
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
One, it's referring to their empire name

309
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and their civilizational name

310
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and it's also referring to the idea that they were supposed

311
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
to come back to Allah.

312
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And that's where the name's blessing came from.

313
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So, that's how the Quran has employed this name.

314
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay, anyway. So, in zaamtum, then there's the word za'am

315
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and this is an important word to understand in the Quran.

316
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Za'am, kidmiz'ama means a snake, a serpent.

317
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Taza'um means a lie.

318
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Azza'um min an ibil wal ghinnam.

319
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is, let me explain this to you, animals.

320
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Sometimes when they buy an animal,

321
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
they check if it's muscular or if it's got good fat,

322
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
depending on what they're going to do with it.

323
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If they're going to load a lot of burdens on it,

324
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
they want to see if it's muscular.

325
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
If they're hungry, they're going to check if it's fat.

326
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Right, because they want to enjoy the fatty meat.

327
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Right, so, when they check the animal like that,

328
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
some of you think you're experts in fruits.

329
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So, when you pick up a fruit in the store,

330
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you kind of like, you check the watermelon.

331
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You listen to the soul of the watermelon and then you...

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Which is, you know, some people have this like...

333
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
They believe they have knowledge of the unseen

334
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
when they pick a cantaloupe or a watermelon,

335
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
but they look like they know what they're doing.

336
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You see, some people really take this seriously.

337
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You know, put that tomato down. It's red though.

338
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, but that one, you see that?

339
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
They're both red.

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So, but this is also called a za'um.

341
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Za'um is the animal that you feel the flesh on.

342
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Roasted greasy meat is called shawat wu za'um.

343
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You know, the first...

344
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The land that starts growing a lot of crop all of a sudden.

345
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Right, that's called az-z'amatid ar-dol wu za'um.

346
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's a farmer that covers the body za'um.

347
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Lots of different meanings from this word,

348
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
but here's the bottom line.

349
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This is why the word za'um was used mostly

350
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
in something that isn't for sure.

351
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're not so sure about it.

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So you use the word za'um.

353
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Like, you know, you say,

354
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Hey, are you going to come tomorrow?

355
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm pretty sure I'm coming.

356
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Are you coming?

357
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm pretty sure.

358
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What are you doing?

359
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You're putting a little bit of doubt

360
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
in whether you're coming or not.

361
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Wala yuhaktaquwala yudra la'allahu kathif.

362
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And it cannot be verified or known for sure

363
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
whether it's true or not.

364
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Like, you can't be entirely certain.

365
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm balfing.

366
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Wala al-azhari ibaratun duwaddikhu ma'akad dhalalat

367
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ttaqeeb alamala yuttaqwubihim minal kalam.

368
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And it indicates, according to al-azhari,

369
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
this is the kind of verb that's used to say,

370
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
when someone's saying something that you cannot fully trust.

371
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You cannot fully trust it.

372
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Now, from this came another word, which is za'een.

373
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Za'een.

374
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Za'een means someone who gives a guarantee.

375
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So it's used in surat Yusuf, for example,

376
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
that whoever finds the cup,

377
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm going to give them the reward of a full camel load of wealth.

378
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And I'm guaranteeing it.

379
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm giving the guarantee of it.

380
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But the guarantor is in making people believe

381
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that he's going to be able to give something,

382
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
even though they haven't seen any evidence.

383
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So they have to rely on his claim

384
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and have confidence in him without evidence.

385
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So that becomes a za'een, a guarantor.

386
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So sometimes, for example, when you're signing papers,

387
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
or you're signing an apartment rent lease agreement,

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
or you're leasing a car or something like that,

389
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
they make you fill out all kinds of paperwork,

390
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
your date of birth, your financial records,

391
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
your job, how much money you make,

392
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
how long have you had the job, what's your shoe size,

393
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
what's your favorite color, all of it,

394
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
they make you fill that out, right?

395
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What's your blood type in case we need to drain your blood

396
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
to make the payment, et cetera, et cetera.

397
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But they don't have a guarantee that you're going to pay,

398
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
but they have to make their best guess

399
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
based on your job history, your financial situation, right?

400
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Have you made payments in the past or not?

401
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And then they basically use that

402
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
as the closest thing to a guarantee.

403
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So they do za'een, right?

404
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And you're basically giving them a guarantee

405
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
that you're going to make the payments based on this.

406
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So you become a za'een, you understand?

407
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So the verb being used, if you are so sure,

408
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
is actually, are you so confident?

409
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But I can tell you're not that confident.

410
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Because if they were absolutely confident

411
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
about what they're saying,

412
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
then the word za'een wouldn't be used.

413
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You understand?

414
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So if you actually think this,

415
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and I know that you don't totally think this,

416
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
then as opposed to other people,

417
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Fatima and Nawalbaut,

418
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
now before I read some hadith to you,

419
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
we need to understand the challenge in this ayah.

420
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Look, I don't try to,

421
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't just try to read them with a silhouette

422
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and then tell you what they said.

423
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
When I study the Quran,

424
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
my first process is Allah is talking to me,

425
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
not to any of you, so are going to me.

426
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Right now, Allah is directly speaking with me

427
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
as a slave of Allah who received,

428
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
by whatever means, received this final revelation.

429
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We got it from those who believe before us,

430
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
said those before us, said those before us,

431
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and now I'm hearing these words.

432
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What am I supposed to think about this ayah?

433
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Right?

434
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So my first question that comes is,

435
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
well, the ayah says,

436
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
if you are actually friends with Allah,

437
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
then you should wish for what?

438
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Death.

439
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So then my question becomes,

440
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
well, if I want to be friends with Allah,

441
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
should I wish for death?

442
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Logical question, right?

443
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Is that what the Quran wants?

444
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because it's saying, if you really are,

445
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
then you should wish for death.

446
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So we need to address that question.

447
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
First and foremost,

448
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
that I misrepresented what Allah said on purpose.

449
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So you understand the problem with that kind of thinking.

450
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The ayah doesn't say,

451
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
if you're actually friends with Allah,

452
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
then wish for death.

453
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It says, if you think you're so confident

454
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
that you're the real friends of Allah,

455
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
as opposed to everyone else on earth,

456
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
mendun and nas.

457
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's a disclaimer, isn't it?

458
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That's an additional qualification.

459
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So it doesn't just say,

460
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
oh, if you're close to Allah,

461
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
you should want to die.

462
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
No, if you're close to Allah,

463
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and you're so confident

464
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
that you're the only one close to Allah,

465
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and everybody else is not,

466
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
then you know what?

467
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You should even be closer to Allah.

468
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Because if you're that close,

469
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
then get even closer.

470
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Because nobody else is.

471
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So that's one dent in that argument.

472
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But the other is, let's take a step back

473
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and understand how Islam wants me to think about death.

474
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Should I be wishing for death?

475
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Should I actually be asking for death?

476
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Sometimes we have these more Islamic

477
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
than Islam type discussions,

478
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
where people say things like,

479
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
we love the Akhirah more than we love disdunya.

480
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Wallahi disdunya is nothing.

481
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Disdunya is nothing.

482
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It is not even a tissue, a used tissue.

483
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It will go away.

484
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And then so much nothing, nothing, nothing.

485
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And I'm like,

486
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
if somebody came to you and you said,

487
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
your parents are nothing,

488
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
you'd get upset because they are something.

489
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Somebody came to you and said,

490
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
the Quran that Allah revealed to us in disdunya is nothing.

491
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You would have a problem with that.

492
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And if somebody told you,

493
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
if somebody says, this tree is nothing,

494
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and that mountain is nothing,

495
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
well Allah says go look at the tree.

496
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And He says go look at the mountain,

497
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and find an ayah in it.

498
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And an ayah is something of value.

499
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
How are you telling me the tree

500
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and the mountain is nothing?

501
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
How are you going to tell me Allah says the winds are something?

502
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Allah says the clouds are something.

503
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
They have value.

504
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Allah says the sea is something, doesn't He?

505
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Doesn't He say that?

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And if it's all nothing,

507
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
by the way, if I do nothing for you,

508
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
then you don't have to say thank you.

509
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Because I did what?

510
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Nothing.

511
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But if I did something for you,

512
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
then at least the courtesy is what?

513
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Thanks.

514
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Allah does so much for us,

515
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and He talks about it in the Qur'an,

516
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and then as a result, what should we do?

517
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
We cannot thank Him for something that has no value.

518
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Isn't that true?

519
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So first, the first is nothing.

520
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Hold on, let's put that in perspective.

521
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
This dunya is nothing compared to the basr.

522
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Of course, this planet is nothing

523
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
compared to the rest of the universe in size.

524
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The Akhira is the size of seven heavens,

525
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and the earth combined.

526
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So clearly, the Akhira is way bigger

527
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
than this dunya, and by comparison, it is nothing.

528
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But right now we are here, and this is something.

529
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And this is so important that Allah decided

530
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
that throughout this,

531
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
throughout up from the seven heavens,

532
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
He decided to speak to us on this earth.

533
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You know what that means?

534
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
This is something.

535
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And you know what?

536
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
If you're nothing, if you're so insignificant,

537
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
why would Allah tell all the angels

538
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
that have ever existed,

539
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I have created this creation

540
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that demands a sajda should be done

541
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
over what I have done?

542
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Like, why would all the angels do sajda

543
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
at the amazing creation of the human being

544
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
if we're nothing, if this life is nothing?

545
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And He didn't just say,

546
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
oh, do sajda to the, you know, to the rule.

547
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Or because of the rule.

548
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
No.

549
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He said, I'm going to make Him from clay, dirt,

550
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
which is earth, and then I'm going to put my rule in Him.

551
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And then you will do sajda.

552
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
He described the entire process

553
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
before we were told to do sajda.

554
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So, you know, sometimes we say these things

555
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and they sound like really cool slogans.

556
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And then you forward them to people

557
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
when you see these YouTube shorts.

558
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This dunya has nothing.

559
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Hey, I want to forward this to all my friends

560
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
because I'm really depressed.

561
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And I just want everyone else to feel

562
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
like dunya has nothing.

563
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yes, in comparison to the Akhira,

564
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Fa ma mataa ul hayatil dunya fil akhirati laqqadil.

565
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The things you would join this life

566
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
are opposed to the after life,

567
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
there are nothing but very little.

568
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So that's one.

569
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The second is, I just,

570
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I just want to be with Allah swt.

571
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't want to live in this world.

572
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I just want to go to, okay,

573
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
let's talk to you a little bit.

574
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Let's have a conversation with you.

575
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Man ahabba, there's a Hadith of the Prophet says, okay?

576
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Man ahabba liqaa Allahi ahabba Allahu liqaaahu

577
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
whoever loves to meet with Allah,

578
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Allah would love to meet with them.

579
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Okay?

580
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Man kariha liqaa Allah,

581
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
kariha Allahu liqaaahu

582
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and whoever doesn't want to meet with Allah,

583
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Allah doesn't want to meet with them.

584
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Now you would think meeting with Allah means what?

585
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Death.

586
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So if you don't love dying,

587
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
then Allah doesn't love you.

588
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And if you hate dying,

589
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
then Allah doesn't want to meet you.

590
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay?

591
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That would, you might take that.

592
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Qalata a'isha'u ba'agu wa z-wajihi

593
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
in na nakrahu al-mout,

594
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
a'isha'u ba'bi'al-lahu anha

595
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and some of his other spouses also said,

596
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
we hate death.

597
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
What?

598
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
A'isha'u wa z-wan?

599
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Wait, you're supposed to be Islamic.

600
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Qalata yisa'ak

601
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
wa lakinna al-moubin idha hadarahu al-mout

602
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
bushira bi-l-udwaninnahi wa karamatihi

603
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
This is not what this means.

604
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
However, when a believer,

605
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
when death comes to a believer,

606
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
when death comes to a believer,

607
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
he is given the good news

608
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
that Allah is happy with him

609
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and he's about to be honored.

610
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
This is mentioned in Sunnah Fusilat.

611
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Inna liwi na qalurabbu l-Allahu ful-mastaqabu

612
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
tatalazalu a'lihimu al-malayka

613
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
anna taqafu wa na ta'azalu wa abshiru bil-danna

614
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
When a person is dying,

615
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
the angels show up before you're dying.

616
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You haven't died yet.

617
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You're dying and angels have already started showing up.

618
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
In the hospital bed, you're in bed,

619
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
people around you are crying

620
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and you can't move your face anymore.

621
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You can't show them with your eyes,

622
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
but angels are starting to show up

623
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and saying congratulations, you made it, sir.

624
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You did good.

625
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Abshunu, congratulations, Jannah is coming for you.

626
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We were, by the way,

627
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
we were your security guards in this life.

628
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And we're going to be escorting you into the Asr.

629
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And you will have everything you ever wanted.

630
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Everybody around you is crying at your life.

631
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You know what?

632
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
This person acted like one day

633
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
they will love to meet with Allah.

634
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And when the time comes,

635
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Allah is now welcoming them

636
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
as if He loves to meet with them.

637
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay.

638
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Fa-laisa shay'un ahabba i-rayhi mimma ababahu

639
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So at that time,

640
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
there will be nothing more beloved to that person

641
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
except for what is in front of them.

642
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Fa-ahabba liqaa Allah

643
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
so they will at that time love meeting with Allah

644
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
wa-ahabba Allah liqaaahu

645
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and Allah will love to meet with them.

646
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Wa-innil kashira ila hudira

647
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And the disbeliever,

648
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
when death is presented to them,

649
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
bushyama bi'adab illahi wa rukubatihi

650
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
they will be given the good news of Allah's punishment

651
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and the outcome of their actions.

652
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Fa-laisa shay'un akraha ilayhi mimma ababahu

653
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
there's nothing more hated to that person

654
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
more than what they see in front of them.

655
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Karihah liqaa Allah

656
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
If this person hated the meeting with Allah

657
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
wa-karihah Allah liqaaahu

658
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Allah hated meeting with them.

659
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Man ahabba liqaa Allah

660
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
ahabba Allah liqaaahu

661
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
wa-min karihah liqaa Allah

662
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
karihah Allah liqaaahu

663
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
fa-qala fa-ateitu a'isha

664
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This is another narration, same one.

665
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The one who loves meeting with Allah,

666
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Allah loves meeting with them,

667
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
the one who hates meeting with Allah,

668
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Allah hates meeting with them.

669
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The Sahabi says,

670
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I came to A'isha l-labilahu anha.

671
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Fa-kultu ya'umal muminin

672
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I said, mother of the believers.

673
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I heard Abu Huraira

674
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I heard Abu Huraira

675
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
mention this hadith from the prophet

676
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
If it is like that, faqad halakna

677
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
then we're dead.

678
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
If that is the case, then

679
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I mean that means we should all die.

680
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's such a depressing hadith.

681
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That's what he said too.

682
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Who?

683
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Aisha l-labilahu.

684
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
He said,

685
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
If that is a hadith,

686
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
he didn't say the hadith,

687
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
he just said,

688
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I heard something,

689
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
he said,

690
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I heard something,

691
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I heard something,

692
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I heard something,

693
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I heard something,

694
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I heard something,

695
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I heard something from Abu Huraira.

696
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
If it's true, we're all dead.

697
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And she said,

698
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Well, if the prophet said,

699
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
you're dead, then you're dead.

700
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But what did he say?

701
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So she said,

702
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Anha,

703
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
What did he say actually?

704
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
She was curious though.

705
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Tell me what he said.

706
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Qa'la qa'la Rasulullah

707
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam

708
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
man ahabba diqaa Allah

709
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
ahabba Allah

710
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
diqaa Allah

711
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The person then told her,

712
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
the prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said,

713
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Whoever loves to meet with Allah,

714
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Allah loves to meet with them.

715
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Man qa'liha diqaa Allah

716
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
qa'liha Allah diqaa

717
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
whoever hated meeting with Allah,

718
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Allah does not like to meet with them.

719
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And then she says,

720
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Wa layisa minna,

721
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh, he said,

722
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Wa layisa minna ahadun

723
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
illa huwa huwa yakra hu'ul moot

724
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and there's not one of us who doesn't hate death.

725
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Who likes death?

726
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Fak'alat.

727
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So she said,

728
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
By the way,

729
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
the one who's saying,

730
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I can't think of anyone who loves to die,

731
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
who wants to die.

732
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Everybody hates death.

733
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Is he not a sahabi?

734
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Is he not a sahabi?

735
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
He's a sahabi, right?

736
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
He's not a sahabi that's going to make a YouTube real about,

737
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
We should love death more than we love life.

738
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Have you let this,

739
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
that's a sahabi if you watch that YouTube video below.

740
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Or you need to have a conversation with Aisha, bro.

741
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Wa bi-Allah.

742
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Fak'alat.

743
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Qa'la hu rasulullah,

744
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

745
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Aisha confirmed,

746
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
that's exactly what the prophet said.

747
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So she had heard this before.

748
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So she told him,

749
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Right, that is what the prophet said.

750
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Wa laysa binda dhita thabu ilayh

751
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And it is not what you are going towards.

752
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Meaning,

753
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
you're taking this in the wrong direction.

754
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Then she says,

755
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Wa lakin idhaa shakha sal-basah

756
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Wa ha'shar iya s-sadr

757
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Wa kasha'ar wal jimd

758
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Wa tashad najatin asabi'

759
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
When the fingers stop moving,

760
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
when the eyes are petrified,

761
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
when the heart,

762
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
when the chest is humbled,

763
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
when the skin,

764
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
the hair rises,

765
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
meaning death comes.

766
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The moment of death.

767
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Fa'inda thalika.

768
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And at that moment,

769
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
whoever would love to meet with Allah,

770
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Allah would love to meet with,

771
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
then this hadith is about

772
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
the moment of your death.

773
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Not the rest of your life.

774
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Now, another narration

775
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

776
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
La yata manna ahadukum wal mauta

777
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
None of you should wish for death.

778
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
None of you should wish for death.

779
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
We have to understand,

780
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
the ayah just said,

781
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
if you are French to Allah,

782
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
then what?

783
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Wish for death.

784
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And now the hadith is saying clearly,

785
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
none of you should wish for death.

786
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We've got to reconcile this.

787
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
We've got to figure this out.

788
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Okay.

789
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Imma mohsi'an fa la'allahu yasdaad.

790
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Wa imma musi'an fa la'allahu yasdaat.

791
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Wa tafakur alaybo khariaan muslin.

792
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
If it's a good person,

793
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
if they live longer,

794
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
then they will do more good deeds.

795
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And if they're not a good person,

796
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
then maybe they'll make doba.

797
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So they shouldn't wish for what?

798
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Death.

799
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Allah is keeping air going into my lungs.

800
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
He's allowing me to inhale and exhale.

801
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Allah is allowing my heart to pump blood

802
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
throughout my body because

803
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
he in his wisdom,

804
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
the one who owns everything in his wisdom,

805
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
yuhiyyuhu yuhiyyuhu,

806
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
decides when I will live,

807
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
decides when I will die.

808
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
He decided,

809
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I still have an opportunity

810
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
to do more good deeds,

811
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
and I still have an opportunity to repent.

812
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It is not time for me to leave yet.

813
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
When there's no purpose left for me on this earth,

814
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and Allah's plan, I will die.

815
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
When there's no purpose left.

816
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And that purpose of mine,

817
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
how long will I live?

818
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
What good will I serve?

819
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
How much opportunity of good will I have?

820
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
That wasn't decided by me.

821
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That was decided by Allah az-zawati.

822
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
This is in the hands of Allah.

823
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So nobody should be wishing for that.

824
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Something that is decreed,

825
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
yuhiyyuhu yuhiyyuhu,

826
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
what you mean?

827
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
He gives life, he gives death.

828
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
He gives life and he gives death.

829
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So now,

830
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
alright,

831
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
let's now understand this ayah again.

832
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And before we do,

833
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
a couple of other statements about death.

834
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Two about death and two about life.

835
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We make a dua in the Quran,

836
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yusuf A.M. made this dua,

837
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Tawafani musliman wa al-hikni bus-salitheen.

838
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Ya Allah, when you give me death,

839
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
give me death as a Muslim.

840
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Take me as a Muslim.

841
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And join me in the company of good people.

842
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
That's the words of Yusuf A.M.

843
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We make dua in Surat Al-Imran,

844
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
wa tawafana ma al-l-abraa.

845
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Take us among good people.

846
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Take us among the good people.

847
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So these are du'as for what?

848
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Death, but they're not for death right now.

849
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You know what these du'as are?

850
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
When the time of death comes,

851
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Ya Allah, allow me to be in a state of Islam,

852
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and allow me to join the people that are good.

853
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
When that time comes.

854
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Ya Allah says,

855
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Ittaqullah ha-haqqatu qatihi wa la tamutuna illa wa antu muslimu.

856
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Don't you dare die except you're in surrender.

857
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Don't you dare let death come to you except you're in surrender.

858
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
This is not wishing for death.

859
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
This is preparing for death.

860
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Those are two separate things.

861
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So that's the goal.

862
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The point of my statement so far is this.

863
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
The believer does not wish for death,

864
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
but the believer prepares for death.

865
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
The believer is ready for death,

866
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
even if they're not wishing for it.

867
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I have to live my life in a way that if Allah took me today,

868
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I should be able to say to Allah,

869
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Ya Allah, today I may tauba.

870
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Before you took me, I may tauba.

871
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And I did whatever good I could,

872
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and I was trying to get away from as much bad as I could.

873
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I have to live my life ready for death,

874
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
not wishing for death.

875
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You understand the point?

876
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Now, if Akhira is everything,

877
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and Dunya is nothing,

878
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
the biggest convention of the year

879
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
where you realize Dunya is nothing is Hajj.

880
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Why?

881
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Because you need to go to Hajj,

882
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
you wear clothes like it's judgment day already.

883
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You know that, right?

884
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I know the billionaire and the homeless person,

885
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
the taxi driver and the owner of the taxi company

886
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
all wearing the same clothes.

887
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
All lined up same way.

888
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We're standing in millions in front of Allah

889
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and sort of his house saying,

890
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
here we come Allah, here we are, here we are,

891
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
we answer your call.

892
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
By the way, this is called a dress rehearsal.

893
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It's a rehearsal for which day?

894
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
For judgment day, when we're going to come before Allah.

895
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That's what this is.

896
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So this is, if there's one time where you should forget about the Dunya,

897
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and you should only think about the Akhira,

898
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
it should be when Hajj, we do tawaaf.

899
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And as we're doing tawaaf,

900
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
we come to the stone and we say,

901
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
ربنا آتنا في الدنيا حسنة وفي الأخيرة حسنة

902
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
وقناع ذاب النار,

903
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
our master give us good in this life and good in the next life

904
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and protect us from the punishment of the fire.

905
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
If this is the time to forget all of the Dunya,

906
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
what should you be asking?

907
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Ya Allah, give us Akhira.

908
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I don't care about Dunya, it's nothing.

909
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Just let me die, let me die here.

910
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Please ya Allah, let me just die here.

911
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So people have seen that.

912
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
When I went to Hajj, I said, Allah, just let me die here.

913
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I was like, you psycho.

914
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Why are you saying, you just said ربنا آتنا في الدنيا حسنة.

915
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Oh, I feel like I'm going to die.

916
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
See this, what happens is people are depressed.

917
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
People have some hopeless situation in their lives.

918
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
People have some other problem going on.

919
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
They owe a lot of people money.

920
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Some other situation.

921
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Ya Allah, just take me because, you know.

922
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
That's not a spiritual situation.

923
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That's a psychological situation or a financial situation

924
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
or a social situation.

925
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And you like to feel better about yourself and lie to yourself

926
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and tell yourself, this is your spiritual situation.

927
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's not. You're lying.

928
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Stop kidding yourself.

929
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You know.

930
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
There are some people that like to be dramatic like that.

931
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Ya Allah, I wish I was dead before this happened.

932
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh, that's a lot easier to just...

933
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So unnecessary drama.

934
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And this is playing with something that Allah has himself given.

935
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Now look at this.

936
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
If Allah did not extend somebody's life,

937
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
then somebody gets to the point where they're 40 years old.

938
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
The Quran marks 40 years old as a pivotal moment in a person's life.

939
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It's the midpoint of their youth has ended

940
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and the older age, the adulthood into old age is going to begin.

941
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So it's the halfway. It's the half time in the match.

942
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Right? That's 40 on average.

943
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So Allah says, at that time, what dua should you make?

944
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:19,000
My master, empower me to be grateful for the favors you've already done for me.

945
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And the favors you have done to my parents.

946
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Isn't that you acknowledging that life has been good?

947
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Because how can you say, Ya Allah, enable me to be grateful for all the blessings you gave me

948
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and all the blessings you gave to my parents if there's nothing good in life?

949
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
If you should only be wishing for death, then this dua would have no meaning.

950
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You understand?

951
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And then you say, Wa Aana Amala Salih Antar Allahu.

952
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Ya Allah, allow me to do good deeds that will make you happy.

953
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Is that a dua for now or also the future?

954
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
That's also the future.

955
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Now you're making dua to have an opportunity to do good deeds in the future.

956
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What I'm saying is guys that, as I study the Quran, I realize,

957
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and I try to analyze what I hear about Islam from the khubba,

958
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
what I hear about Islam from people.

959
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And I realize, we use a lot of slogans.

960
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
We use a lot of catchphrases that aren't actually there against Allah's book.

961
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But they become very common.

962
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You know, we want death more than we want life.

963
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Who said?

964
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Who said?

965
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
He put everything in the search for you all together.

966
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Now let's take another stab at this and understand this properly.

967
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The Quran does not give the same kind of reminder in every situation.

968
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
If you are, if I am, let me not talk about you.

969
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Let me talk about me.

970
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
If I am just having way too much fun, way too much like money is good,

971
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
entertainment is good, family, everything is set, everything is cruising.

972
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Right?

973
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It's easy for me to forget that this life is temporary.

974
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Maybe at that time, a good reminder for me is I should be prepared for death.

975
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And I shouldn't just associate this as my goal.

976
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
But like journey is a lot longer.

977
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I get, you can get distracted easily.

978
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Al-Haqum uttaka'atil.

979
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Allah says it.

980
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
When you have a lot of good things, they distract.

981
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And then you end up basically, hatta az-zortum wal makabir,

982
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
you end up pretty much at the time of death and you didn't even realize you were just distracted.

983
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You know, you went from one PlayStation game to the next game to the next game,

984
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
one Netflix series to the next series to the next series,

985
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and now death is here.

986
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
So maybe it's a good thing for you to step back and remember death a little bit in that situation.

987
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You understand?

988
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But if you're going through a hard time,

989
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
if you're going through a hard time,

990
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
like when difficulty comes, Allah says it's okay, difficulty may be there,

991
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
but you're gonna die, so it's okay.

992
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You should just wish for death.

993
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
No, then you should have hope that things will get better where?

994
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
In this life,

995
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Inna la'a al-Rusli,

996
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
isn't that the opposite?

997
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
There's a balance in this religion

998
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
that if you're becoming too material,

999
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
then maybe you should step back from the material a little bit

1000
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and remember death.

1001
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And if you're becoming too gloomy about life

1002
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
and you're like,

1003
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
oh, death would be better,

1004
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
then maybe you should just shut that part of your brain up.

1005
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And don't listen to that hopeless was-wasa

1006
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
and turn the other way and say,

1007
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
no, ease will come from Allah.

1008
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Allah's help will come.

1009
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You know?

1010
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This is a balance in the Quran.

1011
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's not one size fits all.

1012
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
My life, my emotions, they're not always the same.

1013
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I go through different things in life.

1014
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And at different points,

1015
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
there are different reminders in the Quran

1016
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
that come and help me.

1017
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Assalamu alaikum everyone.

1018
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
There are almost 50,000 students around the world

1019
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
that are interested on top of the students we have

1020
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
in studying the Quran and its meanings

1021
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.

1022
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And they need sponsorships,

1023
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
which is not very expensive.

1024
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV,

1025
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
please do so and visit our sponsorship page.

1026
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I appreciate it so much.

1027
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And pray that Allah gives our mission success

1028
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran

1029
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and the beauty of it the world over.
