0	12000	If I am just having way too much fun, way too much like money is good, entertainment is good, family of everything is set, everything is cruising, right?
12000	16000	It's easy for me to forget that this life is temporary.
16000	25000	Maybe at that time a good reminder for me is I should be prepared for death and I shouldn't just associate this as my goal.
25000	29000	But my journey is a lot longer. You can get distracted easily.
29000	34000	Allah says it. When you have a lot of good things, they distract.
55000	63000	And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family and give it as a gift also. Thank you.
85000	102000	We are now up to ayah 6. Our goal today is to reach ayah number 8, which I think is an easy goal.
102000	109000	So we might not even need the entire time today, but I'm not going to go past ayah number 8. That's at least my assumption for today.
109000	111000	Today's subject is going to be really interesting.
111000	118000	6, 7 and 8, all three ayah that we're going to be discussing have to do with death, which sounds very dark.
118000	130000	But actually it's an opportunity to discuss the Islam's take in Islam's philosophy on death, on life and death and how we view it, how we're supposed to think about that, not just philosophically and theologically,
130000	133000	but what impact is that supposed to have on my day to day life?
134000	142000	Death is a reality, but how much of that plays a role in the way that I live my life and my emotions, how I regulate myself on a day to day basis.
142000	147000	So let me just first begin with this ayah's translation and then inshallah we'll get into the work.
147000	154000	Qul, tell them. When you see Qul in the Quran, it's the Prophet ﷺ being told to speak to somebody directly.
154000	158000	So the Prophet ﷺ is being commanded to address this community.
158000	167000	So Allah's now, the lessons so far were to the Muslims, but now there's a quick switch and now temporarily go talk to them also.
167000	171000	So the secondary audience became the primary audience temporarily.
171000	174000	Okay, they became the primary audience.
174000	181000	And then right after that, they're going to become the secondary audience again and the primary audience will once again be the Muslims.
181000	184000	Ya ayyuhadna zina amadu is coming in ayah number nine.
184000	193000	This is an important piece of information because this tells us that the Quran was speaking to multiple audiences at the same time.
193000	200000	Right? And when it's speaking to multiple audiences, like I'm talking to you, but they can hear me.
200000	203000	Right? Or I'm talking to them and they can hear me.
203000	209000	And then sometimes I switch over and talk to them directly while they can also hear.
210000	215000	Kind of like, you know, a parent when they're yelling at one child and the other kids are enjoying it.
215000	219000	And then they turn to the other one and they're like, your turn.
219000	221000	You know, they switch to the other side.
221000	224000	So, but there is this kind of intifat.
224000	229000	It's called intifat, switching from one audience to another audience.
229000	232000	And this is something that happens in the Quran very strategically.
232000	240000	And this is a lesbian showing us that in the in Medina, when the Quran was being recited and when it was being declared and publicly shared,
240000	244000	that it wasn't just the Muslims that were listening and engaging with the Quran.
244000	247000	It was also actually the Jewish and Christian communities that were engaging with the Quran.
247000	252000	And the Quran was actually telling the Prophet's life to engage them directly in dialogue.
252000	256000	It was actually directly engaging. It's not just talking about them. It's talking to them.
257000	265000	And the Prophet is being instructed directly to engage with them, which is really interesting because there was a mentality that the scholars,
265000	272000	like there's their people of knowledge and they saw the the rest of the Arabs as these uneducated people who don't know how to read and write.
272000	279000	Right. So how can someone who's uneducated officially be debating with someone who is very well educated in their literature?
279000	280000	Right.
280000	286000	It's like it's like somebody who didn't even graduate from school debating with someone who has a PhD.
286000	294000	Right. And the scholarship of the Jewish community, the Israelites, their scholarship is actually called Ahbar in the Quran.
294000	297000	Ahbar actually comes from the word Hebrew, which means ink.
297000	304000	And because they wrote so much and because they read the leather that they stretched and they wrote on,
304000	309000	they read that so much and they put their finger on it so much, their hands would always have ink on them.
310000	313000	Smudged from the reading and the writing they did all the time.
313000	319000	And so they just got called people of ink because they're doing all this reading and writing all the time.
319000	326000	I had the good fortune of making friends with a couple of rabbis and, you know, I hang out with them.
326000	329000	They shall not be named because they would rather remain anonymous.
329000	331000	Right. Which is cool. I get it.
331000	336000	So but when I talk to them, I am so impressed with the level of study that they do.
336000	339000	Like it's unbelievable how much study they do.
339000	348000	I mean, one of the friends I know, he studied 14 years in their madrasa, like their religious school, 14 years,
348000	355000	and then went to university and did a PhD, you know, another eight years.
355000	360000	And then after that, he still now studies an average of 10 hours a day.
360000	362000	This is an average of 10 hours.
362000	366000	Like the amount that they study is staggering.
366000	370000	It's actually so impressive, you know.
370000	371000	And this is their history.
371000	376000	Their history is that of volumes and volumes and volumes and volumes of books.
376000	378000	These are people of a lot of learning.
378000	384000	And now the Prophet, peace be upon him, was an ummi, which means doesn't read and doesn't write.
384000	388000	And you didn't write this with your hands because you don't know how to write.
388000	401000	That's what the Prophet, the claim about the Prophet, is,
401000	404000	he's being told to go debate with them.
404000	406000	Why? How could that be possible?
406000	410000	This is actually the second episode where this is being done with the Israelites.
410000	415000	The first episode that this was being done was with Jesus, with Isa, peace be upon him.
415000	420000	And with Isa, peace be upon him, he went to the Israelite scholars and you would quote the Torah to them.
420000	424000	Because Allah taught Isa, peace be upon him, the Torah and the Injeel.
424000	427000	And you had the book, the wisdom, the Torah and the Injeel.
427000	430000	And he didn't go to their schools to learn it.
430000	432000	Allah revealed it over again to him.
432000	436000	So you can think of it as Torah was revealed to Musa, peace be upon him,
436000	440000	and it was revealed again to Isa, peace be upon him.
440000	444000	So the original Torah, because it was changed so many times through history.
444000	446000	So Jesus had it again.
446000	451000	So he would quote them the Torah better than they knew after all of their scholarship.
451000	455000	And we know in the Quran, we have something about Jesus that's not even in the biblical literature.
455000	458000	Like he started speaking from the day he was born.
458000	464000	So now, not just, this is ummi, meaning unlettered as if they came out of their child.
464000	468000	He was literally ummi, like he just came out of his own.
468000	472000	And he was already speaking to them, you understand?
472000	476000	So this is a repeat of something that has happened before,
476000	479000	but the Prophet Isa, peace be upon him, is being told to challenge them with this divine knowledge.
479000	483000	And this also tells us something else about the nature of our religion.
483000	489000	If you know your book, if you know the scripture that Allah has revealed, the Quran,
489000	495000	then you don't have to be intimidated by the qualifications of someone.
495000	502000	And I can't talk to them about this because they have way too much, you know, too many degrees that I can't challenge.
502000	506000	Because sometimes you'll find in a debate or a discussion, somebody might say,
506000	508000	oh yeah, what degree do you have?
508000	510000	What qualifications do you have?
510000	514000	And qualifications are about how many books have you read, right?
514000	516000	How many classes and courses have you taken?
516000	523000	You know, how many courses of education have you completed from one degree to another, to another, to another?
523000	526000	Which is all about knowledge, right?
526000	529000	That's all the more degrees you have, the more knowledge you have.
529000	536000	But the Quran, interestingly, the Quran didn't emphasize knowledge as much as it emphasized thinking.
536000	540000	So the Quran keeps saying, it doesn't constantly say,
541000	543000	don't you then know?
543000	545000	It says,
545000	547000	don't you then think?
547000	549000	So what's the difference between knowing and thinking?
549000	553000	So I'll give you a quick example of this because this also goes back to
553000	556000	and it goes back to that concept.
556000	560000	And that is that, you know, everybody can watch the news.
560000	561000	Everybody can watch the news.
561000	567000	You can say, oh, this war started, or the price went up for gasoline, the price went up.
567000	569000	Or, you know, food prices went up or whatever.
569000	571000	Anybody can see that.
571000	579000	But there are some people who can see that and they know that that means that there's a ripple effect of this bit of news.
579000	581000	And behind it, there's an entire story.
581000	583000	And after it, there's an entire story.
583000	584000	And they can think through that.
584000	589000	It's not just a bit of information, but they can analyze that information, right?
589000	591000	You can study history.
591000	597000	In study and history, you can see this nation came, this empire came, that this empire came, that this empire came.
597000	601000	But if somebody studies the philosophy of history, you know what they study?
601000	604000	How do nations rise and how do nations fall?
604000	607000	What, like they study the formula behind it, right?
607000	609000	That's actually thinking.
609000	613000	That's not just the information because, you know, even in school, sometimes you had to take a test.
613000	615000	You had to memorize a bunch of information.
615000	619000	And then when the test came, you just have to write the information that you memorized.
619000	625000	So you had the knowledge, but you didn't have the thought, the thought process behind it, right?
625000	631000	And by the way, some of the most boring subjects when you were younger are subjects like history, right?
631000	633000	Literature, these are the boring subjects.
633000	635000	I don't have to know all this.
635000	636000	What's the point of it?
636000	637000	Right?
637000	645000	And then as you become older and wiser, you'll realize that those are some of the most important things that develop a person's understanding, right?
645000	648000	Because then Akali is being applied.
648000	654000	What the Prophet s.a.w. is teaching us is that it's not the degrees that make it intellectual.
654000	658000	Actually, it's thinking that makes it intellectual.
658000	664000	You can have someone in the desert that has never gone to a university who's a bigger intellectual than someone who has 20 degrees.
664000	668000	And they've got all this information gathered up.
668000	670000	And I'm not saying those people can't be wise.
670000	676000	Also, they can be, but I've met plenty of, I'm sorry to say this, but I've met plenty of PhDs that are stupid.
677000	684000	And I've met plenty of taxi drivers that dropped out of school in third grade that are very wise, that are extremely intellectual.
684000	687000	That's reality life, right?
687000	691000	So here, all Ya'ayu and Nazeena hadu, you go say to them.
691000	694000	The Prophet's being told, go address them.
694000	696000	And then say what to them?
696000	700000	Ya'ayu and Nazeena hadu means those from the Jewish community.
700000	702000	Ya'ayu and Nazeena hadu.
702000	704000	The word hadu is interesting because it's a verb.
704000	710000	If it was Ya'ayu and Yehud, and Yehud is the Jewish term also, right?
710000	714000	And in some societies, this became a condescending term, but this is original.
714000	715000	There's a history behind the term.
715000	717000	We'll look at that history in a second.
717000	719000	But the word hadu is a verb.
719000	721000	And it was used in Arabic.
721000	726000	According to Hamid al-Din Farahi, he argues that it was used in Arabic for those who belong to the Jewish community.
726000	728000	So it was not a condescending term.
728000	730000	It was actually used as a regular term.
730000	737000	The verb in its original meaning in Arabic, hadayahudu actually means to repent, to make tawbah.
737000	739000	Hadayahudu means to make tawbah.
739000	743000	So Ya'ayu and Nazeena hadu actually means those who repented in the past also.
743000	747000	It doesn't just mean those who were Jewish, but also means those who repented.
747000	753000	Hadaa also means to come back, those who went back, meaning those who went back to God.
753000	755000	Which is actually another meaning of tawbah.
755000	758000	Tawbah means to return back to Allah, as it does in it.
758000	760000	So it says,
762000	771000	If you have the assumption that you are in fact close friends and protective friends to Allah,
771000	774000	as opposed to all other people,
774000	777000	then wish for death.
777000	782000	If in fact you are truthful and solid in your claim.
782000	785000	These are the words that this is a word of translation of the ayah.
785000	792000	The word hadaa also means to move gently, to move slowly and gently.
792000	794000	So that's one of the side meanings of it.
794000	795000	I just give it to you.
795000	801000	But I want to read this to you because this is actually an excerpt from a book called Mufradatun Quran.
801000	807000	Which means terms of the Quran, written by a remarkable scholar, Hamiduddin Farahi Rahimallah.
807000	812000	He was an Indian scholar, but he had studied, he had traveled across the Arab world also.
813000	821000	And he wrote books in which he specialized in what the Quran is saying and how that compares to the Torah.
821000	824000	And he actually mastered Hebrew also.
824000	826000	So he knew quite a bit of Hebrew.
826000	832000	And he would comment on words in the Quran that are also found in the Torah and knew a comparative analysis of them.
832000	835000	One of his most amazing books is Arat Yusahiyeh, Timad-u-Zabih.
835000	839000	For those of you that can read Arabic, the correct position in who was to be slaughtered.
839000	843000	Was it Ishmael that was to be slaughtered by the dream of Abraham?
843000	844000	Or was it Isaac?
844000	845000	Was it Ismael or Ishaq?
845000	847000	Because Muslims have both opinions in our history.
847000	851000	Some Muslims believe it was Ishaq, some Muslims believe it was Ismael.
851000	854000	So he wrote a book about why he believes it's Ismael A.S.
854000	860000	What's really cool about his book is the first argument is the Quran's argument.
860000	863000	The second argument is the Torah's argument.
863000	867000	And the third argument is from Jewish scholarship.
867000	870000	Not even from Muslim scholarship, Jewish scholarship.
870000	874000	And he shows demonstrably how it is actually Ismael A.S.
874000	876000	That was supposed to be the one to be slaughtered.
876000	878000	He proves it from all three.
878000	879000	And then comes to that conclusion.
879000	881000	But a very unique kind of writer.
881000	886000	Anyway, so he talked about the word hadu because it has that biblical connotation.
886000	889000	He says, hadayahudu haudantaba waraja'a.
889000	891000	This word means to repent and to go back.
891000	894000	Hikayaat an-du'a'i Musa A.S.
894000	897000	This is also used in that way in the dua of Musa A.S.
897000	898000	which is in the Quran.
898000	902000	Wa qtub lana fi hadihehid dunya hasana wasil aakhira.
902000	904000	I actually read this to you from Surat al-A'raf.
904000	908000	A guarantee for us good in this life and in the next life.
908000	910000	Inna hudna ilayka.
910000	916000	Inna hudna ilayka from yawudu or hadayahudu is actually we come back to you.
916000	917000	Meaning we repent to you.
917000	919000	So the word is used in the meaning of repentance.
919000	923000	Wa qalu wa aizan hada sarayahudiyan.
923000	926000	And hada also means for someone to be Jewish.
926000	928000	To actually be Jewish.
928000	930000	And it's also used in that way.
930000	931000	For example,
931000	932000	khunuhudana un-nasara.
932000	934000	Haqadah tahuwada wa danika'a la taliqil arabiya.
934000	939000	So the word tahuwada, for those of you that know a little bit of Arabic morphology, sarf,
939000	941000	tahuwada tanasara.
941000	943000	So nasrani means Christian.
943000	946000	Tanasara means to become Christian or to be Christian.
946000	949000	Tahuwada means to be Jewish.
949000	952000	So, kama yuqal tanasara bida nasraniya.
952000	954000	Wa za'ama tta'inun thu qur'an.
954000	956000	Anna haathith kala maqalima khata.
956000	959000	And some critics believe that this word is a mistake in the Quran.
959000	960000	Fa inna isma liyawud,
960000	962000	lesa maafuza min maddat haud.
962000	965000	Balhwa nisba ilayyawudah.
965000	969000	So, he says some people think this is a mistake in the Quran
969000	974000	because the word Jewish or the word yawudi or hada
974000	977000	is not about returning or repenting.
977000	980000	It actually originally has to do with Judea
980000	983000	or Judah, actually Judah,
983000	986000	who is the fourth son of Jacob in the Bible.
986000	988000	So, Jacob has 12 sons
988000	992000	and the fourth son's name is Yahuda, actually, Yahuda.
992000	996000	And that's in English or Latinized, it becomes Judah.
996000	1000000	And later on, instead of reading it, I'll summarize this for you,
1000000	1003000	later on the Jewish empire, from his children, by the way,
1003000	1006000	from the children of Judah, from Yaqub al-Azim,
1006000	1009000	eventually came Dawud al-Azim.
1009000	1012000	And from Dawud al-Azim came Suleiman al-Azim.
1012000	1015000	And Dawud al-Azim had a massive empire
1015000	1017000	and so did Suleiman al-Azim.
1017000	1022000	And that empire was called Judah, or Judea, actually, Yahuda.
1022000	1026000	So, it was named after their forefather, which is the son of Yaqub.
1026000	1031000	Eventually, the Israelites, they started fighting with each other.
1031000	1033000	The believers of that time, the Muslims of that time,
1033000	1035000	they started fighting with each other
1035000	1037000	and they broke that one nation into two nations,
1037000	1040000	much after Suleiman al-Azim.
1040000	1044000	They broke it up into two nations called Judea and Israel.
1044000	1046000	So, they're called Judea and Israel.
1046000	1048000	And eventually, even those nations fell apart,
1048000	1052000	others came and invaded them.
1052000	1059000	And when they invaded them, actually, let me read that part for you here.
1059000	1061000	Did I click here? No, I didn't.
1061000	1062000	Oh, here it is.
1062000	1068000	So, the fourth son of Yaqub, who was the fourth son of Yaqub,
1068000	1070000	was Dawud al-Azim.
1070000	1073000	Dawud al-Azim was from this lineage.
1073000	1075000	So, it became the second son of the Jewish nation,
1075000	1076000	the Jewish nation of Israel,
1076000	1079000	and the rest of the Israelites, the rest of the Israelites,
1079000	1080000	and the rest of the Israelites,
1080000	1082000	and then after that, the Sabbath and the Caldions,
1082000	1084000	the Caldions, they called them.
1084000	1086000	You can look them up on Wikipedia.
1086000	1089000	There was a Caldian empire, they came and they kind of destroyed
1089000	1091000	the Jewish empire and they broke it up.
1091000	1094000	And now they saw all the Jews,
1094000	1096000	they didn't used to get called Jews before.
1096000	1099000	The Judeans were the people that lived in the kingdom of Judea
1099000	1102000	or the descendants of Judah, you understand?
1102000	1106000	But the enemy came and they just started calling all of the Israelites
1106000	1108000	Yerudi.
1108000	1110000	And they didn't say Yerudi with Addaal,
1110000	1112000	they said Yerudi with Addaal.
1112000	1113000	So, they changed it.
1113000	1117000	And so, it started that way, this just became the new word for them.
1117000	1120000	But it goes back to the fourth son of Yaqub al-Azim,
1120000	1123000	or historically you can say it refers to the time
1123000	1126000	where their empire started disintegrating.
1126000	1128000	The Jewish empire started disintegrating
1128000	1131000	and that's when this name became the common name.
1131000	1133000	There's another interesting thing about this name.
1133000	1137000	The Bible has the story of Yaqub and his family.
1137000	1139000	Like you don't have the absolute Yusuf in the Quran.
1139000	1142000	So, the Bible has the story of Yaqub and his wife
1142000	1145000	and each one of his wives, like Lea and Rachel,
1145000	1147000	and you know, he had two wives and two servants
1147000	1149000	and he had children with all of them.
1149000	1153000	And one of those Rachel's children are Joseph and Benjamin,
1153000	1155000	who we call what, Yusuf and Midyamin.
1155000	1158000	But the other children, the way they have the story is that
1158000	1161000	every time a child was born, the mother, in this case Lea,
1161000	1163000	made a prayer. Right?
1163000	1165000	Oh, this is a mercy from God.
1165000	1168000	Or God has granted this child and things like that.
1168000	1172000	And so, she turns back to Allah and makes dua
1172000	1174000	and when Judah was born,
1174000	1177000	and she said the Hebrew version of Yahuza
1177000	1179000	and that's why she named him that,
1179000	1182000	which actually has similar meaning to coming back to God
1182000	1184000	as a show of gratitude to God.
1184000	1186000	So, what Allah does in the Quran when he says,
1186000	1189000	Ya'u Yuhadna dhina hadu, he's actually,
1189000	1192000	he's killing two birds with one stone.
1192000	1195000	One, it's referring to their empire name
1195000	1197000	and their civilizational name
1197000	1200000	and it's also referring to the idea that they were supposed
1200000	1202000	to come back to Allah.
1202000	1204000	And that's where the name's blessing came from.
1204000	1207000	So, that's how the Quran has employed this name.
1207000	1210000	Okay, anyway. So, in zaamtum, then there's the word za'am
1210000	1213000	and this is an important word to understand in the Quran.
1213000	1217000	Za'am, kidmiz'ama means a snake, a serpent.
1217000	1219000	Taza'um means a lie.
1219000	1221000	Azza'um min an ibil wal ghinnam.
1221000	1223000	This is, let me explain this to you, animals.
1223000	1225000	Sometimes when they buy an animal,
1225000	1228000	they check if it's muscular or if it's got good fat,
1228000	1230000	depending on what they're going to do with it.
1230000	1232000	If they're going to load a lot of burdens on it,
1232000	1234000	they want to see if it's muscular.
1234000	1237000	If they're hungry, they're going to check if it's fat.
1237000	1239000	Right, because they want to enjoy the fatty meat.
1239000	1241000	Right, so, when they check the animal like that,
1241000	1243000	some of you think you're experts in fruits.
1243000	1245000	So, when you pick up a fruit in the store,
1245000	1249000	you kind of like, you check the watermelon.
1249000	1254000	You listen to the soul of the watermelon and then you...
1254000	1258000	Which is, you know, some people have this like...
1258000	1261000	They believe they have knowledge of the unseen
1261000	1264000	when they pick a cantaloupe or a watermelon,
1264000	1267000	but they look like they know what they're doing.
1267000	1269000	You see, some people really take this seriously.
1269000	1271000	You know, put that tomato down. It's red though.
1271000	1273000	Yeah, but that one, you see that?
1273000	1276000	They're both red.
1276000	1281000	So, but this is also called a za'um.
1281000	1284000	Za'um is the animal that you feel the flesh on.
1284000	1288000	Roasted greasy meat is called shawat wu za'um.
1288000	1290000	You know, the first...
1290000	1294000	The land that starts growing a lot of crop all of a sudden.
1294000	1298000	Right, that's called az-z'amatid ar-dol wu za'um.
1298000	1300000	It's a farmer that covers the body za'um.
1300000	1302000	Lots of different meanings from this word,
1302000	1304000	but here's the bottom line.
1304000	1310000	This is why the word za'um was used mostly
1310000	1313000	in something that isn't for sure.
1313000	1314000	You're not so sure about it.
1314000	1316000	So you use the word za'um.
1316000	1317000	Like, you know, you say,
1317000	1319000	Hey, are you going to come tomorrow?
1319000	1322000	I'm pretty sure I'm coming.
1322000	1324000	Are you coming?
1324000	1326000	I'm pretty sure.
1326000	1327000	What are you doing?
1327000	1329000	You're putting a little bit of doubt
1329000	1331000	in whether you're coming or not.
1331000	1334000	Wala yuhaktaquwala yudra la'allahu kathif.
1334000	1337000	And it cannot be verified or known for sure
1337000	1339000	whether it's true or not.
1339000	1342000	Like, you can't be entirely certain.
1342000	1343000	I'm balfing.
1343000	1347000	Wala al-azhari ibaratun duwaddikhu ma'akad dhalalat
1347000	1350000	ttaqeeb alamala yuttaqwubihim minal kalam.
1350000	1353000	And it indicates, according to al-azhari,
1353000	1355000	this is the kind of verb that's used to say,
1355000	1359000	when someone's saying something that you cannot fully trust.
1359000	1361000	You cannot fully trust it.
1361000	1364000	Now, from this came another word, which is za'een.
1364000	1365000	Za'een.
1365000	1368000	Za'een means someone who gives a guarantee.
1368000	1370000	So it's used in surat Yusuf, for example,
1370000	1372000	that whoever finds the cup,
1372000	1375000	I'm going to give them the reward of a full camel load of wealth.
1375000	1377000	And I'm guaranteeing it.
1377000	1379000	I'm giving the guarantee of it.
1379000	1383000	But the guarantor is in making people believe
1383000	1385000	that he's going to be able to give something,
1385000	1387000	even though they haven't seen any evidence.
1387000	1390000	So they have to rely on his claim
1390000	1393000	and have confidence in him without evidence.
1393000	1396000	So that becomes a za'een, a guarantor.
1396000	1399000	So sometimes, for example, when you're signing papers,
1399000	1402000	or you're signing an apartment rent lease agreement,
1402000	1405000	or you're leasing a car or something like that,
1405000	1407000	they make you fill out all kinds of paperwork,
1407000	1410000	your date of birth, your financial records,
1410000	1412000	your job, how much money you make,
1412000	1414000	how long have you had the job, what's your shoe size,
1414000	1417000	what's your favorite color, all of it,
1417000	1419000	they make you fill that out, right?
1419000	1421000	What's your blood type in case we need to drain your blood
1421000	1423000	to make the payment, et cetera, et cetera.
1423000	1426000	But they don't have a guarantee that you're going to pay,
1426000	1429000	but they have to make their best guess
1429000	1433000	based on your job history, your financial situation, right?
1433000	1435000	Have you made payments in the past or not?
1435000	1437000	And then they basically use that
1437000	1439000	as the closest thing to a guarantee.
1439000	1441000	So they do za'een, right?
1441000	1443000	And you're basically giving them a guarantee
1443000	1446000	that you're going to make the payments based on this.
1446000	1448000	So you become a za'een, you understand?
1448000	1451000	So the verb being used, if you are so sure,
1451000	1453000	is actually, are you so confident?
1453000	1456000	But I can tell you're not that confident.
1456000	1459000	Because if they were absolutely confident
1459000	1460000	about what they're saying,
1460000	1462000	then the word za'een wouldn't be used.
1462000	1463000	You understand?
1463000	1465000	So if you actually think this,
1465000	1468000	and I know that you don't totally think this,
1468000	1470000	then as opposed to other people,
1470000	1471000	Fatima and Nawalbaut,
1471000	1473000	now before I read some hadith to you,
1473000	1476000	we need to understand the challenge in this ayah.
1476000	1477000	Look, I don't try to,
1477000	1479000	I don't just try to read them with a silhouette
1479000	1481000	and then tell you what they said.
1481000	1483000	When I study the Quran,
1483000	1486000	my first process is Allah is talking to me,
1486000	1488000	not to any of you, so are going to me.
1488000	1490000	Right now, Allah is directly speaking with me
1490000	1492000	as a slave of Allah who received,
1492000	1496000	by whatever means, received this final revelation.
1496000	1498000	We got it from those who believe before us,
1498000	1500000	said those before us, said those before us,
1500000	1501000	and now I'm hearing these words.
1501000	1503000	What am I supposed to think about this ayah?
1503000	1504000	Right?
1504000	1505000	So my first question that comes is,
1505000	1506000	well, the ayah says,
1506000	1508000	if you are actually friends with Allah,
1508000	1510000	then you should wish for what?
1510000	1511000	Death.
1511000	1513000	So then my question becomes,
1513000	1516000	well, if I want to be friends with Allah,
1516000	1518000	should I wish for death?
1518000	1520000	Logical question, right?
1520000	1522000	Is that what the Quran wants?
1522000	1525000	Because it's saying, if you really are,
1525000	1527000	then you should wish for death.
1527000	1530000	So we need to address that question.
1530000	1531000	First and foremost,
1531000	1535000	that I misrepresented what Allah said on purpose.
1535000	1538000	So you understand the problem with that kind of thinking.
1538000	1539000	The ayah doesn't say,
1539000	1541000	if you're actually friends with Allah,
1541000	1542000	then wish for death.
1542000	1545000	It says, if you think you're so confident
1545000	1547000	that you're the real friends of Allah,
1547000	1550000	as opposed to everyone else on earth,
1550000	1552000	mendun and nas.
1552000	1553000	That's a disclaimer, isn't it?
1553000	1555000	That's an additional qualification.
1555000	1556000	So it doesn't just say,
1556000	1558000	oh, if you're close to Allah,
1558000	1559000	you should want to die.
1559000	1561000	No, if you're close to Allah,
1561000	1562000	and you're so confident
1562000	1563000	that you're the only one close to Allah,
1563000	1566000	and everybody else is not,
1566000	1568000	then you know what?
1568000	1571000	You should even be closer to Allah.
1571000	1573000	Because if you're that close,
1573000	1575000	then get even closer.
1575000	1577000	Because nobody else is.
1577000	1580000	So that's one dent in that argument.
1580000	1582000	But the other is, let's take a step back
1582000	1585000	and understand how Islam wants me to think about death.
1585000	1587000	Should I be wishing for death?
1587000	1590000	Should I actually be asking for death?
1590000	1592000	Sometimes we have these more Islamic
1592000	1595000	than Islam type discussions,
1595000	1596000	where people say things like,
1596000	1599000	we love the Akhirah more than we love disdunya.
1599000	1601000	Wallahi disdunya is nothing.
1601000	1602000	Disdunya is nothing.
1602000	1606000	It is not even a tissue, a used tissue.
1606000	1609000	It will go away.
1609000	1612000	And then so much nothing, nothing, nothing.
1612000	1613000	And I'm like,
1613000	1615000	if somebody came to you and you said,
1615000	1617000	your parents are nothing,
1617000	1620000	you'd get upset because they are something.
1620000	1621000	Somebody came to you and said,
1621000	1626000	the Quran that Allah revealed to us in disdunya is nothing.
1626000	1628000	You would have a problem with that.
1628000	1629000	And if somebody told you,
1629000	1631000	if somebody says, this tree is nothing,
1631000	1632000	and that mountain is nothing,
1632000	1635000	well Allah says go look at the tree.
1635000	1636000	And He says go look at the mountain,
1636000	1638000	and find an ayah in it.
1638000	1640000	And an ayah is something of value.
1640000	1641000	How are you telling me the tree
1641000	1643000	and the mountain is nothing?
1643000	1646000	How are you going to tell me Allah says the winds are something?
1646000	1648000	Allah says the clouds are something.
1648000	1649000	They have value.
1649000	1651000	Allah says the sea is something, doesn't He?
1651000	1653000	Doesn't He say that?
1653000	1654000	And if it's all nothing,
1654000	1656000	by the way, if I do nothing for you,
1656000	1659000	then you don't have to say thank you.
1659000	1660000	Because I did what?
1660000	1661000	Nothing.
1661000	1664000	But if I did something for you,
1664000	1667000	then at least the courtesy is what?
1667000	1668000	Thanks.
1668000	1670000	Allah does so much for us,
1670000	1672000	and He talks about it in the Qur'an,
1672000	1675000	and then as a result, what should we do?
1675000	1679000	We cannot thank Him for something that has no value.
1679000	1681000	Isn't that true?
1681000	1683000	So first, the first is nothing.
1683000	1685000	Hold on, let's put that in perspective.
1685000	1689000	This dunya is nothing compared to the basr.
1689000	1692000	Of course, this planet is nothing
1692000	1696000	compared to the rest of the universe in size.
1696000	1699000	The Akhira is the size of seven heavens,
1699000	1700000	and the earth combined.
1700000	1703000	So clearly, the Akhira is way bigger
1703000	1705000	than this dunya, and by comparison, it is nothing.
1705000	1708000	But right now we are here, and this is something.
1708000	1710000	And this is so important that Allah decided
1710000	1711000	that throughout this,
1711000	1713000	throughout up from the seven heavens,
1713000	1715000	He decided to speak to us on this earth.
1715000	1716000	You know what that means?
1716000	1717000	This is something.
1717000	1718000	And you know what?
1718000	1721000	If you're nothing, if you're so insignificant,
1721000	1723000	why would Allah tell all the angels
1723000	1724000	that have ever existed,
1724000	1726000	I have created this creation
1726000	1728000	that demands a sajda should be done
1728000	1730000	over what I have done?
1730000	1733000	Like, why would all the angels do sajda
1733000	1736000	at the amazing creation of the human being
1736000	1739000	if we're nothing, if this life is nothing?
1739000	1740000	And He didn't just say,
1740000	1744000	oh, do sajda to the, you know, to the rule.
1744000	1745000	Or because of the rule.
1745000	1746000	No.
1746000	1748000	He said, I'm going to make Him from clay, dirt,
1748000	1751000	which is earth, and then I'm going to put my rule in Him.
1751000	1753000	And then you will do sajda.
1753000	1755000	He described the entire process
1755000	1757000	before we were told to do sajda.
1757000	1760000	So, you know, sometimes we say these things
1760000	1762000	and they sound like really cool slogans.
1762000	1763000	And then you forward them to people
1763000	1765000	when you see these YouTube shorts.
1765000	1766000	This dunya has nothing.
1766000	1768000	Hey, I want to forward this to all my friends
1768000	1770000	because I'm really depressed.
1770000	1772000	And I just want everyone else to feel
1772000	1774000	like dunya has nothing.
1774000	1776000	Yes, in comparison to the Akhira,
1776000	1780000	Fa ma mataa ul hayatil dunya fil akhirati laqqadil.
1780000	1782000	The things you would join this life
1782000	1783000	are opposed to the after life,
1783000	1784000	there are nothing but very little.
1784000	1785000	So that's one.
1785000	1786000	The second is, I just,
1786000	1789000	I just want to be with Allah swt.
1789000	1790000	I don't want to live in this world.
1790000	1792000	I just want to go to, okay,
1792000	1793000	let's talk to you a little bit.
1793000	1795000	Let's have a conversation with you.
1795000	1798000	Man ahabba, there's a Hadith of the Prophet says, okay?
1798000	1801000	Man ahabba liqaa Allahi ahabba Allahu liqaaahu
1801000	1803000	whoever loves to meet with Allah,
1803000	1805000	Allah would love to meet with them.
1805000	1806000	Okay?
1806000	1808000	Man kariha liqaa Allah,
1808000	1809000	kariha Allahu liqaaahu
1809000	1810000	and whoever doesn't want to meet with Allah,
1810000	1812000	Allah doesn't want to meet with them.
1812000	1815000	Now you would think meeting with Allah means what?
1815000	1816000	Death.
1816000	1818000	So if you don't love dying,
1818000	1820000	then Allah doesn't love you.
1820000	1822000	And if you hate dying,
1822000	1824000	then Allah doesn't want to meet you.
1824000	1825000	Okay?
1825000	1826000	That would, you might take that.
1826000	1828000	Qalata a'isha'u ba'agu wa z-wajihi
1828000	1830000	in na nakrahu al-mout,
1830000	1831000	a'isha'u ba'bi'al-lahu anha
1831000	1833000	and some of his other spouses also said,
1833000	1834000	we hate death.
1834000	1835000	What?
1835000	1837000	A'isha'u wa z-wan?
1837000	1839000	Wait, you're supposed to be Islamic.
1840000	1842000	Qalata yisa'ak
1842000	1844000	wa lakinna al-moubin idha hadarahu al-mout
1844000	1846000	bushira bi-l-udwaninnahi wa karamatihi
1846000	1848000	This is not what this means.
1848000	1850000	However, when a believer,
1850000	1853000	when death comes to a believer,
1853000	1855000	when death comes to a believer,
1855000	1857000	he is given the good news
1857000	1858000	that Allah is happy with him
1858000	1859000	and he's about to be honored.
1859000	1861000	This is mentioned in Sunnah Fusilat.
1861000	1864000	Inna liwi na qalurabbu l-Allahu ful-mastaqabu
1864000	1866000	tatalazalu a'lihimu al-malayka
1866000	1868000	anna taqafu wa na ta'azalu wa abshiru bil-danna
1868000	1870000	When a person is dying,
1870000	1872000	the angels show up before you're dying.
1872000	1874000	You haven't died yet.
1874000	1877000	You're dying and angels have already started showing up.
1877000	1879000	In the hospital bed, you're in bed,
1879000	1881000	people around you are crying
1881000	1883000	and you can't move your face anymore.
1883000	1884000	You can't show them with your eyes,
1884000	1886000	but angels are starting to show up
1886000	1888000	and saying congratulations, you made it, sir.
1889000	1890000	You did good.
1891000	1894000	Abshunu, congratulations, Jannah is coming for you.
1894000	1895000	We were, by the way,
1895000	1897000	we were your security guards in this life.
1898000	1900000	And we're going to be escorting you into the Asr.
1901000	1903000	And you will have everything you ever wanted.
1903000	1906000	Everybody around you is crying at your life.
1908000	1909000	You know what?
1909000	1911000	This person acted like one day
1911000	1913000	they will love to meet with Allah.
1913000	1915000	And when the time comes,
1915000	1917000	Allah is now welcoming them
1917000	1919000	as if He loves to meet with them.
1919000	1920000	Okay.
1921000	1924000	Fa-laisa shay'un ahabba i-rayhi mimma ababahu
1925000	1927000	So at that time,
1927000	1929000	there will be nothing more beloved to that person
1929000	1930000	except for what is in front of them.
1930000	1932000	Fa-ahabba liqaa Allah
1932000	1935000	so they will at that time love meeting with Allah
1935000	1936000	wa-ahabba Allah liqaaahu
1936000	1938000	and Allah will love to meet with them.
1938000	1940000	Wa-innil kashira ila hudira
1940000	1941000	And the disbeliever,
1941000	1943000	when death is presented to them,
1943000	1945000	bushyama bi'adab illahi wa rukubatihi
1945000	1947000	they will be given the good news of Allah's punishment
1947000	1949000	and the outcome of their actions.
1949000	1951000	Fa-laisa shay'un akraha ilayhi mimma ababahu
1951000	1953000	there's nothing more hated to that person
1953000	1955000	more than what they see in front of them.
1955000	1957000	Karihah liqaa Allah
1957000	1959000	If this person hated the meeting with Allah
1959000	1960000	wa-karihah Allah liqaaahu
1960000	1962000	Allah hated meeting with them.
1962000	1963000	Man ahabba liqaa Allah
1963000	1964000	ahabba Allah liqaaahu
1964000	1965000	wa-min karihah liqaa Allah
1965000	1966000	karihah Allah liqaaahu
1966000	1968000	fa-qala fa-ateitu a'isha
1968000	1970000	This is another narration, same one.
1970000	1972000	The one who loves meeting with Allah,
1972000	1973000	Allah loves meeting with them,
1973000	1974000	the one who hates meeting with Allah,
1974000	1976000	Allah hates meeting with them.
1976000	1977000	The Sahabi says,
1977000	1979000	I came to A'isha l-labilahu anha.
1979000	1980000	Fa-kultu ya'umal muminin
1980000	1981000	I said, mother of the believers.
1982000	1983000	I heard Abu Huraira
1983000	1984000	I heard Abu Huraira
1984000	1987000	mention this hadith from the prophet
1987000	1989000	If it is like that, faqad halakna
1989000	1990000	then we're dead.
1990000	1992000	If that is the case, then
1992000	1994000	I mean that means we should all die.
1994000	1996000	It's such a depressing hadith.
1996000	1997000	That's what he said too.
1997000	1998000	Who?
1998000	1999000	Aisha l-labilahu.
1999000	2000000	He said,
2000000	2001000	If that is a hadith,
2001000	2002000	he didn't say the hadith,
2002000	2003000	he just said,
2003000	2004000	I heard something,
2004000	2005000	he said,
2005000	2006000	I heard something,
2006000	2007000	I heard something,
2007000	2008000	I heard something,
2008000	2009000	I heard something,
2009000	2010000	I heard something,
2010000	2012000	I heard something from Abu Huraira.
2012000	2014000	If it's true, we're all dead.
2014000	2015000	And she said,
2015000	2017000	Well, if the prophet said,
2017000	2019000	you're dead, then you're dead.
2019000	2021000	But what did he say?
2021000	2022000	So she said,
2022000	2023000	Anha,
2023000	2025000	What did he say actually?
2025000	2026000	She was curious though.
2026000	2028000	Tell me what he said.
2028000	2029000	Qa'la qa'la Rasulullah
2029000	2030000	Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam
2030000	2031000	man ahabba diqaa Allah
2031000	2032000	ahabba Allah
2032000	2033000	diqaa Allah
2033000	2035000	The person then told her,
2035000	2036000	the prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said,
2036000	2038000	Whoever loves to meet with Allah,
2038000	2039000	Allah loves to meet with them.
2039000	2040000	Man qa'liha diqaa Allah
2040000	2042000	qa'liha Allah diqaa
2042000	2043000	whoever hated meeting with Allah,
2043000	2045000	Allah does not like to meet with them.
2045000	2046000	And then she says,
2046000	2047000	Wa layisa minna,
2047000	2048000	Oh, he said,
2048000	2049000	Wa layisa minna ahadun
2049000	2051000	illa huwa huwa yakra hu'ul moot
2051000	2054000	and there's not one of us who doesn't hate death.
2054000	2056000	Who likes death?
2056000	2057000	Fak'alat.
2057000	2058000	So she said,
2058000	2059000	By the way,
2059000	2061000	the one who's saying,
2061000	2063000	I can't think of anyone who loves to die,
2063000	2064000	who wants to die.
2064000	2066000	Everybody hates death.
2066000	2068000	Is he not a sahabi?
2069000	2070000	Is he not a sahabi?
2070000	2071000	He's a sahabi, right?
2071000	2074000	He's not a sahabi that's going to make a YouTube real about,
2074000	2077000	We should love death more than we love life.
2077000	2078000	Have you let this,
2078000	2082000	that's a sahabi if you watch that YouTube video below.
2082000	2084000	Or you need to have a conversation with Aisha, bro.
2084000	2085000	Wa bi-Allah.
2088000	2089000	Fak'alat.
2089000	2090000	Qa'la hu rasulullah,
2090000	2091000	Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
2091000	2092000	Aisha confirmed,
2092000	2094000	that's exactly what the prophet said.
2094000	2096000	So she had heard this before.
2096000	2097000	So she told him,
2097000	2098000	Right, that is what the prophet said.
2098000	2100000	Wa laysa binda dhita thabu ilayh
2100000	2102000	And it is not what you are going towards.
2102000	2103000	Meaning,
2103000	2105000	you're taking this in the wrong direction.
2106000	2107000	Then she says,
2107000	2109000	Wa lakin idhaa shakha sal-basah
2109000	2110000	Wa ha'shar iya s-sadr
2110000	2111000	Wa kasha'ar wal jimd
2111000	2113000	Wa tashad najatin asabi'
2113000	2115000	When the fingers stop moving,
2115000	2117000	when the eyes are petrified,
2117000	2118000	when the heart,
2118000	2119000	when the chest is humbled,
2119000	2120000	when the skin,
2120000	2121000	the hair rises,
2121000	2122000	meaning death comes.
2122000	2123000	The moment of death.
2123000	2124000	Fa'inda thalika.
2124000	2126000	And at that moment,
2126000	2128000	whoever would love to meet with Allah,
2128000	2130000	Allah would love to meet with,
2130000	2132000	then this hadith is about
2132000	2134000	the moment of your death.
2134000	2136000	Not the rest of your life.
2136000	2138000	Now, another narration
2138000	2140000	of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
2140000	2143000	La yata manna ahadukum wal mauta
2143000	2146000	None of you should wish for death.
2147000	2149000	None of you should wish for death.
2149000	2150000	We have to understand,
2150000	2151000	the ayah just said,
2151000	2153000	if you are French to Allah,
2153000	2154000	then what?
2154000	2155000	Wish for death.
2155000	2157000	And now the hadith is saying clearly,
2157000	2159000	none of you should wish for death.
2159000	2161000	We've got to reconcile this.
2161000	2163000	We've got to figure this out.
2163000	2164000	Okay.
2164000	2166000	Imma mohsi'an fa la'allahu yasdaad.
2166000	2168000	Wa imma musi'an fa la'allahu yasdaat.
2168000	2171000	Wa tafakur alaybo khariaan muslin.
2171000	2173000	If it's a good person,
2173000	2175000	if they live longer,
2175000	2177000	then they will do more good deeds.
2177000	2179000	And if they're not a good person,
2179000	2181000	then maybe they'll make doba.
2181000	2183000	So they shouldn't wish for what?
2183000	2184000	Death.
2184000	2188000	Allah is keeping air going into my lungs.
2188000	2190000	He's allowing me to inhale and exhale.
2190000	2192000	Allah is allowing my heart to pump blood
2192000	2194000	throughout my body because
2194000	2196000	he in his wisdom,
2196000	2198000	the one who owns everything in his wisdom,
2198000	2199000	yuhiyyuhu yuhiyyuhu,
2199000	2200000	decides when I will live,
2200000	2201000	decides when I will die.
2201000	2202000	He decided,
2202000	2204000	I still have an opportunity
2204000	2205000	to do more good deeds,
2205000	2207000	and I still have an opportunity to repent.
2207000	2210000	It is not time for me to leave yet.
2210000	2213000	When there's no purpose left for me on this earth,
2213000	2215000	and Allah's plan, I will die.
2215000	2217000	When there's no purpose left.
2217000	2218000	And that purpose of mine,
2218000	2219000	how long will I live?
2219000	2220000	What good will I serve?
2220000	2222000	How much opportunity of good will I have?
2222000	2224000	That wasn't decided by me.
2224000	2227000	That was decided by Allah az-zawati.
2227000	2230000	This is in the hands of Allah.
2230000	2231000	So nobody should be wishing for that.
2231000	2233000	Something that is decreed,
2233000	2234000	yuhiyyuhu yuhiyyuhu,
2234000	2235000	what you mean?
2235000	2236000	He gives life, he gives death.
2236000	2238000	He gives life and he gives death.
2238000	2239000	So now,
2239000	2242000	alright,
2242000	2245000	let's now understand this ayah again.
2245000	2247000	And before we do,
2247000	2249000	a couple of other statements about death.
2249000	2252000	Two about death and two about life.
2252000	2253000	We make a dua in the Quran,
2253000	2255000	Yusuf A.M. made this dua,
2255000	2258000	Tawafani musliman wa al-hikni bus-salitheen.
2258000	2260000	Ya Allah, when you give me death,
2260000	2262000	give me death as a Muslim.
2262000	2264000	Take me as a Muslim.
2264000	2267000	And join me in the company of good people.
2267000	2270000	That's the words of Yusuf A.M.
2270000	2272000	We make dua in Surat Al-Imran,
2272000	2274000	wa tawafana ma al-l-abraa.
2274000	2277000	Take us among good people.
2277000	2278000	Take us among the good people.
2278000	2280000	So these are du'as for what?
2280000	2283000	Death, but they're not for death right now.
2283000	2284000	You know what these du'as are?
2284000	2287000	When the time of death comes,
2287000	2291000	Ya Allah, allow me to be in a state of Islam,
2291000	2295000	and allow me to join the people that are good.
2295000	2297000	When that time comes.
2297000	2298000	Ya Allah says,
2298000	2303000	Ittaqullah ha-haqqatu qatihi wa la tamutuna illa wa antu muslimu.
2303000	2306000	Don't you dare die except you're in surrender.
2306000	2309000	Don't you dare let death come to you except you're in surrender.
2309000	2310000	This is not wishing for death.
2310000	2312000	This is preparing for death.
2312000	2314000	Those are two separate things.
2314000	2316000	So that's the goal.
2316000	2318000	The point of my statement so far is this.
2318000	2321000	The believer does not wish for death,
2321000	2324000	but the believer prepares for death.
2324000	2327000	The believer is ready for death,
2327000	2329000	even if they're not wishing for it.
2329000	2333000	I have to live my life in a way that if Allah took me today,
2333000	2335000	I should be able to say to Allah,
2335000	2337000	Ya Allah, today I may tauba.
2337000	2339000	Before you took me, I may tauba.
2339000	2341000	And I did whatever good I could,
2341000	2344000	and I was trying to get away from as much bad as I could.
2344000	2347000	I have to live my life ready for death,
2347000	2349000	not wishing for death.
2349000	2350000	You understand the point?
2350000	2353000	Now, if Akhira is everything,
2353000	2355000	and Dunya is nothing,
2355000	2359000	the biggest convention of the year
2359000	2362000	where you realize Dunya is nothing is Hajj.
2362000	2364000	Why?
2364000	2365000	Because you need to go to Hajj,
2365000	2368000	you wear clothes like it's judgment day already.
2368000	2370000	You know that, right?
2370000	2373000	I know the billionaire and the homeless person,
2373000	2375000	the taxi driver and the owner of the taxi company
2375000	2378000	all wearing the same clothes.
2378000	2381000	All lined up same way.
2381000	2383000	We're standing in millions in front of Allah
2383000	2385000	and sort of his house saying,
2385000	2387000	here we come Allah, here we are, here we are,
2387000	2388000	we answer your call.
2388000	2392000	By the way, this is called a dress rehearsal.
2392000	2394000	It's a rehearsal for which day?
2394000	2397000	For judgment day, when we're going to come before Allah.
2397000	2398000	That's what this is.
2398000	2401000	So this is, if there's one time where you should forget about the Dunya,
2401000	2403000	and you should only think about the Akhira,
2403000	2407000	it should be when Hajj, we do tawaaf.
2407000	2409000	And as we're doing tawaaf,
2409000	2412000	we come to the stone and we say,
2412000	2416000	ربنا آتنا في الدنيا حسنة وفي الأخيرة حسنة
2416000	2418000	وقناع ذاب النار,
2418000	2423000	our master give us good in this life and good in the next life
2423000	2425000	and protect us from the punishment of the fire.
2425000	2428000	If this is the time to forget all of the Dunya,
2428000	2430000	what should you be asking?
2430000	2432000	Ya Allah, give us Akhira.
2432000	2434000	I don't care about Dunya, it's nothing.
2434000	2436000	Just let me die, let me die here.
2436000	2438000	Please ya Allah, let me just die here.
2438000	2440000	So people have seen that.
2440000	2442000	When I went to Hajj, I said, Allah, just let me die here.
2442000	2444000	I was like, you psycho.
2444000	2449000	Why are you saying, you just said ربنا آتنا في الدنيا حسنة.
2449000	2452000	Oh, I feel like I'm going to die.
2452000	2457000	See this, what happens is people are depressed.
2457000	2460000	People have some hopeless situation in their lives.
2460000	2462000	People have some other problem going on.
2462000	2464000	They owe a lot of people money.
2464000	2465000	Some other situation.
2465000	2469000	Ya Allah, just take me because, you know.
2469000	2471000	That's not a spiritual situation.
2471000	2474000	That's a psychological situation or a financial situation
2474000	2476000	or a social situation.
2476000	2479000	And you like to feel better about yourself and lie to yourself
2479000	2482000	and tell yourself, this is your spiritual situation.
2482000	2484000	It's not. You're lying.
2484000	2486000	Stop kidding yourself.
2486000	2487000	You know.
2487000	2489000	There are some people that like to be dramatic like that.
2489000	2492000	Ya Allah, I wish I was dead before this happened.
2492000	2496000	Oh, that's a lot easier to just...
2498000	2500000	So unnecessary drama.
2500000	2503000	And this is playing with something that Allah has himself given.
2503000	2504000	Now look at this.
2504000	2506000	If Allah did not extend somebody's life,
2506000	2509000	then somebody gets to the point where they're 40 years old.
2509000	2513000	The Quran marks 40 years old as a pivotal moment in a person's life.
2513000	2517000	It's the midpoint of their youth has ended
2517000	2520000	and the older age, the adulthood into old age is going to begin.
2520000	2523000	So it's the halfway. It's the half time in the match.
2523000	2526000	Right? That's 40 on average.
2526000	2529000	So Allah says, at that time, what dua should you make?
2529000	2539000	My master, empower me to be grateful for the favors you've already done for me.
2539000	2542000	And the favors you have done to my parents.
2542000	2546000	Isn't that you acknowledging that life has been good?
2546000	2552000	Because how can you say, Ya Allah, enable me to be grateful for all the blessings you gave me
2552000	2557000	and all the blessings you gave to my parents if there's nothing good in life?
2557000	2561000	If you should only be wishing for death, then this dua would have no meaning.
2561000	2562000	You understand?
2562000	2565000	And then you say, Wa Aana Amala Salih Antar Allahu.
2565000	2569000	Ya Allah, allow me to do good deeds that will make you happy.
2569000	2571000	Is that a dua for now or also the future?
2571000	2573000	That's also the future.
2573000	2577000	Now you're making dua to have an opportunity to do good deeds in the future.
2577000	2581000	What I'm saying is guys that, as I study the Quran, I realize,
2581000	2585000	and I try to analyze what I hear about Islam from the khubba,
2585000	2587000	what I hear about Islam from people.
2587000	2591000	And I realize, we use a lot of slogans.
2591000	2598000	We use a lot of catchphrases that aren't actually there against Allah's book.
2598000	2600000	But they become very common.
2600000	2603000	You know, we want death more than we want life.
2603000	2604000	Who said?
2604000	2605000	Who said?
2605000	2611000	He put everything in the search for you all together.
2611000	2615000	Now let's take another stab at this and understand this properly.
2615000	2622000	The Quran does not give the same kind of reminder in every situation.
2622000	2626000	If you are, if I am, let me not talk about you.
2626000	2627000	Let me talk about me.
2627000	2633000	If I am just having way too much fun, way too much like money is good,
2633000	2638000	entertainment is good, family, everything is set, everything is cruising.
2638000	2639000	Right?
2639000	2643000	It's easy for me to forget that this life is temporary.
2643000	2648000	Maybe at that time, a good reminder for me is I should be prepared for death.
2648000	2652000	And I shouldn't just associate this as my goal.
2652000	2654000	But like journey is a lot longer.
2654000	2656000	I get, you can get distracted easily.
2656000	2657000	Al-Haqum uttaka'atil.
2657000	2658000	Allah says it.
2658000	2661000	When you have a lot of good things, they distract.
2661000	2665000	And then you end up basically, hatta az-zortum wal makabir,
2665000	2669000	you end up pretty much at the time of death and you didn't even realize you were just distracted.
2669000	2673000	You know, you went from one PlayStation game to the next game to the next game,
2673000	2675000	one Netflix series to the next series to the next series,
2675000	2677000	and now death is here.
2677000	2682000	So maybe it's a good thing for you to step back and remember death a little bit in that situation.
2682000	2683000	You understand?
2683000	2686000	But if you're going through a hard time,
2686000	2688000	if you're going through a hard time,
2688000	2692000	like when difficulty comes, Allah says it's okay, difficulty may be there,
2692000	2694000	but you're gonna die, so it's okay.
2694000	2696000	You should just wish for death.
2696000	2699000	No, then you should have hope that things will get better where?
2699000	2700000	In this life,
2700000	2702000	Inna la'a al-Rusli,
2702000	2704000	isn't that the opposite?
2704000	2707000	There's a balance in this religion
2707000	2709000	that if you're becoming too material,
2709000	2712000	then maybe you should step back from the material a little bit
2712000	2714000	and remember death.
2714000	2716000	And if you're becoming too gloomy about life
2716000	2717000	and you're like,
2717000	2719000	oh, death would be better,
2719000	2722000	then maybe you should just shut that part of your brain up.
2722000	2725000	And don't listen to that hopeless was-wasa
2725000	2727000	and turn the other way and say,
2727000	2729000	no, ease will come from Allah.
2729000	2731000	Allah's help will come.
2731000	2732000	You know?
2732000	2734000	This is a balance in the Quran.
2734000	2736000	It's not one size fits all.
2736000	2739000	My life, my emotions, they're not always the same.
2739000	2741000	I go through different things in life.
2741000	2742000	And at different points,
2742000	2744000	there are different reminders in the Quran
2744000	2746000	that come and help me.
2747000	2748000	Assalamu alaikum everyone.
2748000	2751000	There are almost 50,000 students around the world
2751000	2753000	that are interested on top of the students we have
2753000	2755000	in studying the Quran and its meanings
2755000	2758000	and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.
2758000	2759000	And they need sponsorships,
2759000	2760000	which is not very expensive.
2760000	2763000	So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV,
2763000	2765000	please do so and visit our sponsorship page.
