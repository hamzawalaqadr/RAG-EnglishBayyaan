1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Which is why social media is so addictive. A lot of times people end up on social media for hours and hours

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,560
because they're escaping a reality that they don't want to face.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:16,240
Right? They can't deal with it. A lot of people end up at a bar drinking because they can't deal with what's going on at home

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,600
or what's going on with their life. They can't face that reality.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,080
So when the reality becomes difficult, then human beings want to find some comfort in, you know, some kind of distraction.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,440
So it's not just, oh, they saw some entertainment. They ran towards it, put it in its context.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,880
They were going through a really tough time and in those kinds of times, those kinds of things become all the more attractive.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,200
Salamu alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,520
so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on bayanah TV.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,480
I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in brief and then in great detail.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,560
And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanahtv.com.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,760
And once you appreciate what's going on in bayanah TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,640
and give it as a gift also. Thank you.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
Salamu alaikum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuhu.

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:49,800
We are attempting to understand the final ayah of Surah al-Jumu'as, ayah number 11.

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,040
A rough translation is what I will start with.

17
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:03,840
And when they see a trade or distraction, in fadhu ilayha, they run towards it or they disperse towards it.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
And they leave you standing.

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Tell them what is in Allah's possession is better than distraction and better than trade or business.

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,520
Wa Allahul khairul raziqeen.

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,040
And Allah is the best of all providers, boys.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,440
Hey boys, hey boys.

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,120
Yeah, guys, you're distracting.

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,240
So turn this way.

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,760
Yeah.

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,120
Cool, we're cool.

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,640
Okay, very good.

28
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:46,560
All right, so inshaAllah, so as we wrap up this this ayah, I want to just start with a little bit of vocabulary and then we'll get into it.

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,520
There are a few key words, tijara, lahu, infadha, taraka, and then jizq.

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,440
Those are the few key words that in this ayah.

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,600
So we'll start with tijara so you guys understand that word better.

32
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:08,800
The word tijara is one of those words in Arabic that is very rare because the ta and the jim, they don't really come together in Arabic in the beginning of a word.

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
It's the only word in Arabic like that.

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,440
So usually Arabic words are made up of three root letters, most of them.

35
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,600
And there's no other word that has ta and jim together like that except for tijara.

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,160
The word ittajara, which means to trade or to seek a reward.

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,920
Al-amal talaban del-ajar, any work you do hoping that you'll get paid will be called tijara.

38
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,320
So that's the first basic meaning.

39
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,520
Al-tasarru fi raasil maal talaban lirribh.

40
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,560
When you invest, hoping that you'll make some profit from it, investments are also called tijara.

41
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,320
So so far tijara is work.

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,120
Anything you're hoping to get paid for, investments.

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,040
Ful'anu antajir bi katha ayhaziq bihi a'arifu al-wajha al-muqtasib minhu.

44
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,680
When something is a tajir of something, that means they're really good at it.

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,600
And they know how to earn from it.

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,920
So like an expert can also be called a tajir.

47
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,080
Okay, someone is a tajir in something, that's their trade.

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,040
You know like their trade is so and so, their trade is mechanics, their trade is cars, etc.

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,400
So that's another meaning.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Most of the time the word tajir was actually used for the guy that sells wine in the old Arabic before Islam.

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
They use this word very commonly for the wine seller.

52
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,680
Which he was the one selling the wine, he was also the bartender.

53
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,840
He was the one storing it and they used to sit with him and he would court for them and tell them stories and then they would pay him.

54
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,320
So he was doing all the work, right?

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,640
So from the beginning to end and from it they kind of started using that for anybody who makes money doing all kinds of work.

56
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,560
So it kind of expanded in its meaning.

57
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,760
Anyway, now this ayah, another word that we're going to see and I'll just explain the word to you ahead of time,

58
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,000
is the word lahu.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Lahu actually commonly gets translated distraction and you might see for example some short surahs,

60
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
you may remember Al-Haqumut Takathur, right?

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
So al-Ha is from this word, lahu.

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,080
And it means, it actually means the back of your throat, the yufila, the thing that's hanging in your throat dangling.

63
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
That's actually called al-Haq.

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,960
And lohua is, they have those grinders that make the seed into powder, they make the seed into wheat, right?

65
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,160
When they drop the seeds in it, the thing that's dropped in it, that's actually called al-Luhua.

66
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,120
So from it came the idea that when you drop something deep inside, like this thing that's hanging deep inside

67
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,760
and you're dropping the seed inside the grinder.

68
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,720
And from it came the idea that when you are involved in an activity that you get sucked into it.

69
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,880
You just get pulled into it and you kind of get lost in it, right?

70
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
That kind of an activity is called lahu.

71
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
So for example, if you're, I don't know, watching a movie, playing a game,

72
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,160
you know, you're just scrolling TikTok on your phone or something and you lost track of time and you just,

73
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,760
you got, you get deeper and deeper in it and the world around you stops to exist, right?

74
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,800
And when that happens, then that is a form of lahu.

75
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
So from it came the idea of distraction.

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,640
This word was used even for the Prophet ﷺ.

77
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Fa anta anhu talaha.

78
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,480
Is surat al-Abasah, right?

79
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,760
Amma ja'aka wa amma man ja'aka yas'a wa huwa yakhshah.

80
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,800
Fa anta anhu talaha, from the same origin, right?

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,400
So the Sahabi Abdullah ibn Ummaqtum, he was a relative of the Prophet ﷺ,

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
a distant relative from the in-law side and he was also blind.

83
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
And he came somehow to ask the Prophet a question, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,480
And the Prophet ﷺ had a rare opportunity to talk to one of the leaders of Quraish.

85
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,600
The leaders of the Quraish, first of all, you can't get a hold of them easily.

86
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,920
But if you do get a rare chance to talk to them, you should take full like, full opportunity

87
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,280
and speak to them as best chance you get, right?

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,440
So the Prophet is taking this opportunity to talk to one of the leaders about Islam

89
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,400
and Abdullah ibn Ummaqtum, who's one of his family members,

90
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,640
who actually, because you're family, you have access.

91
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,720
So you can talk to him anytime.

92
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,680
But he came and he interrupted the conversation.

93
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,560
And but he's also blind.

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,640
But the thing about being blind is that when you're blind, your other senses are more sharp,

95
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,000
right?

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
So he's blind, but he's not deaf,

97
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,280
which means he can hear that there's already a conversation going on.

98
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
But it didn't matter to him.

99
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,120
He was so feeling such a need of urgency to ask the Prophet ﷺ whatever question he wanted to ask.

100
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
So he interrupted the conversation.

101
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,440
Now the Prophet ﷺ did not want to interrupt him and say,

102
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
Hey, Abdullah, let me finish this and I'll talk to you.

103
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,960
Just give me a minute.

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,760
I'll talk to you.

105
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,000
Even that much the Prophet ﷺ thought would be too harsh for Abdullah.

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,120
It would be too much for him because he would say,

107
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,080
I came all this way to ask the Prophet ﷺ and I've now,

108
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,120
and he would feel bad.

109
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,760
I interrupted.

110
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,160
I didn't realize or he would get the wrong idea and say,

111
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,280
Oh, I'm not that important.

112
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,080
Right.

113
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,480
So the Prophet ﷺ did not want to make him feel bad.

114
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,400
And he didn't want to lose the opportunity of talking to the Quraishi leader.

115
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,840
Now he's stuck in the situation where if he talks to Abdullah bin Umqtum,

116
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
the Quraishi leader will be like, Oh, I guess you're busy right now.

117
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm going to go.

118
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
I have other things to do and he's going to walk away.

119
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,640
The opportunity is gone.

120
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,040
So the Prophet ﷺ was stressed about what to do.

121
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,480
And when he was stressed, there was a bulge on his forehead.

122
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,680
This is this is called Abbas.

123
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Like when these lines show up on your forehead and these this comes together.

124
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,040
This is Abbas.

125
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,160
And the Prophet ﷺ just kind of turned his head just a little bit.

126
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,360
You know when you do in frustration,

127
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,760
but no sound came out of his mouth.

128
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,800
No word was said.

129
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,640
And by the way, why wouldn't he say a word?

130
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,040
Because if he says a word, who's going to hear it?

131
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,240
Abdullah will hear it and he's going to feel like something is off.

132
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,120
And if he just does, this is called Ta'awwaha.

133
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,080
Right.

134
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,040
Then he's going to notice.

135
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,480
Who's going to notice that?

136
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,840
So he's going to feel hurt.

137
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
So he's not even doing that.

138
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
But Allah captures that and says,

139
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,040
He frowned.

140
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,640
He turned his head.

141
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,680
But the thing about turning your head or even turning your face a little bit

142
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,080
is Abdullah, whose supposed feelings are supposed to be hurt,

143
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,920
can't see it.

144
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
So there's no way he could get hurt.

145
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,520
But Allah captures that still and says,

146
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,480
Nope, not even that much.

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,600
Abbas.

148
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,280
Right.

149
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,960
Now this is what's Allah s.w.

150
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,640
And we're not worth the dust of his feet.

151
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,480
But I can tell you in being in a position of public speaking,

152
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
one of the things that's very, very, very difficult

153
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,280
is somebody comes and asks me a question.

154
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,160
And they come and ask me a question and they tell me

155
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,960
that their uncle, when they were five years old,

156
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,040
they took them for a walk and then they said this.

157
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,120
And then their cousin said this and their brother said this.

158
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,440
And also this other time, their grandma,

159
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,360
she was cooking food and then they keep going.

160
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,040
Right.

161
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
And they're telling me the entire,

162
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,800
because they say, before I ask my question,

163
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
I need you to understand the background.

164
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,400
It all began when I was five years old.

165
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
And then by the time I was seven,

166
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
and then one time in ninth grade,

167
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,560
and then one time, and the day I got married,

168
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,080
and then after my first baby,

169
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,240
and then, okay, you're almost ready for the question.

170
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,720
Hold on.

171
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
And as they're doing that, the people behind them are like,

172
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,920
and now I have to make a choice about,

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,760
can I just, can you please get to your question?

174
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,320
Because even if I say, can you please get to your question,

175
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,200
what might they feel?

176
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,120
Oh my God, he has no patience for me.

177
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
He doesn't want to hear what I have to say, how rude.

178
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
I had listened to so many hours of you.

179
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,240
I have gone to sleep.

180
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
I have gone to sleep for 10 years listening to you,

181
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,480
and you couldn't even hear about my uncle.

182
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,560
We, you know, but in my head, I'm thinking,

183
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,880
if I am not going to cut the short,

184
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,520
then the other person's going to think I'm being rude to them.

185
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,640
Right?

186
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,960
And then there's a few hundred of you.

187
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,160
There's one of me.

188
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,400
Right?

189
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
So if I give each of you one minute,

190
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,640
right, just one minute, that would be how many minutes?

191
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,840
That'd be 400 minutes.

192
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,840
And each one of you would feel like I only got one minute.

193
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
And I would feel like I'm almost dead.

194
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,560
Because,

195
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
so when you're in a position of any kind of leadership,

196
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,200
sometimes you are,

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,640
and this is not just in public speaking,

198
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,000
parents, for example,

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,320
three of your kids come and talk to you at the same time.

200
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,800
And you have,

201
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,920
you can't talk to all three of them

202
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,960
because you only have one mouth.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,560
Right?

204
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
So you decide to pick one of them.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,840
And what did the other two feel all of a sudden?

206
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,320
All of a sudden, they feel like,

207
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,040
oh yeah, okay, yeah, listen to her first.

208
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,280
Yeah.

209
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,280
She's the favorite.

210
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:34,880
Right?

211
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
Or you hear in the background, you hear,

212
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,720
you know, whatever.

213
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,680
You hear that just on the little bit of,

214
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,800
you know.

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,480
So there's this difficult position he was put in.

216
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,800
And Allah even captured that and said,

217
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,080
for a moment,

218
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,760
you got distracted from the blind Sahabi

219
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
because you were trying to get the message across to the leader.

220
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,840
I don't want you to worry about the leaders ever,

221
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,960
more than I want you to worry

222
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,800
about the weakest of your companions.

223
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,000
They are my VIPs.

224
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,320
That's not my VIP.

225
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,440
Those are my VIPs.

226
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,560
In the world's eyes,

227
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
the millionaire, the billionaire,

228
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
if I had a chance to give Bawah to Elon Musk

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,440
or if I had a chance to talk to Jeff Bezos about Zakat

230
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
or something, you know,

231
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,240
that's a huge opportunity.

232
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,920
And then there's a guy who doesn't have a job,

233
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,680
who's, you know, he's trying to make whatever money he can,

234
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
driving an Uber,

235
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
and he's not making his expenses.

236
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,040
And he has a question.

237
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,080
And all of a sudden, I'm like,

238
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
what's going to be a bigger benefit to Islam?

239
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,800
If I can get Jeff Bezos Zakat money,

240
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
or if I can, you know, talk,

241
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,080
and Allah is teaching a powerful lesson

242
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,880
to the Prophet's life,

243
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,480
that he, you know,

244
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,520
and Allah says,

245
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,320
and the one who came to you rushing,

246
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,320
Allah mentions Yas'a.

247
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,200
You know how hard it is

248
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
for a blind person to walk fast?

249
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,800
Allah acknowledges that.

250
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,320
And he says,

251
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
and he's afraid that he might disobey Allah.

252
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,720
He's got, he's full of fear of Allah.

253
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
And the more you are mindful of Allah,

254
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,120
the more Allah is,

255
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,080
Allah says,

256
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,360
you remember me, I will remember you.

257
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,280
So Allah is now remembering him.

258
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,120
And he says,

259
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
You got too busy that you couldn't give him attention.

260
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,280
And it's not like the Prophet wasn't giving him attention.

261
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,600
He was just,

262
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,240
just had a turn of the head.

263
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,560
But the standard is very high for our messenger,

264
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,760
Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.

265
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,880
And if that's the standard,

266
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
and we say, you know, we, I hear,

267
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,640
sometimes I hear things and I just say,

268
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,960
really, do you really believe that?

269
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,760
Because he was like,

270
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
bro, we have to follow Quran and Sunnah.

271
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,720
Quran and Sunnah.

272
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,200
How many times do you hear that?

273
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,320
Quran and Sunnah.

274
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,960
I was like, okay.

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
Oh, what do you mean by Quran and Sunnah?

276
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,560
Well, you know, the miswak,

277
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,800
the beard,

278
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,160
the beard size,

279
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,640
let's check the beard size to make sure that it's on the Sunnah.

280
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,280
Let's make sure that, you know, the clothing.

281
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,160
And you know what,

282
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,600
some of those things can be argued,

283
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,280
but there are some things that cannot be argued.

284
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,120
There are multiple variations of how to interpret some of those Sunnah

285
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,680
of the Prophet's life.

286
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,720
So I'm fine.

287
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,240
But there are some things that are unargu,

288
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
inarguable, how to treat people.

289
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,280
There's no ambiguity.

290
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,200
Sunnahs of the Prophet's life.

291
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,280
Where are those Sunnahs, bro?

292
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,680
Where did those Sunnahs go?

293
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,520
What, that's not Quran?

294
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,960
That's not Sunnah, you know?

295
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,160
So we also get distracted by certain things

296
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,400
in the face of other things.

297
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,080
And we've come up with our own,

298
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,600
you know, we have to do the greater good.

299
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,840
And you could do a lot of bad things

300
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,720
and hurt a lot of bad,

301
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
a lot of people because you're worried about the greater good.

302
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,160
You know?

303
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,160
So this, anyway,

304
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,320
so that's a side nobody about lehu,

305
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,760
lehu actually means to get distracted by something

306
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
that keeps you from something more important.

307
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,200
Right?

308
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,640
It keeps you from something more important.

309
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,840
That's happened sometimes to me,

310
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,200
like I'm going to a doctor's appointment or something,

311
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
and I'm not going to get a chance to get this appointment.

312
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
It was like six months waiting or something.

313
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,400
And I got a chance, and I have a work meeting.

314
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,240
And what happens with me with work meetings is,

315
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,960
I don't know what it is.

316
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,120
I have to drive while I'm having a meeting.

317
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,440
I can't, I can't sit and have a meeting.

318
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,760
I have to be walking, driving, doing something.

319
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
And the more, the more intense the meeting is,

320
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,520
the more straight I drive.

321
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
So I missed the exit because I'm having a meeting.

322
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,360
I'm like, what did you say?

323
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm like, oh, ghosting meeting.

324
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,560
That's also lehu.

325
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,880
Lehu because one thing distracted me from something else.

326
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,080
That's, that's the meaning of that.

327
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,240
Okay.

328
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,800
So there's just some vocabulary that I want you to know.

329
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,840
And lehi, lehi to be shayin also means to fall in love with something,

330
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,160
to actually fall in love with something.

331
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,240
Like you're just completely enveloped in it.

332
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,200
You know, like you lost in love, the idea of lost in love.

333
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,360
You just fell on fallen in love.

334
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,920
That's how it's used actually in Arabic.

335
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,520
وَكَذَا دِكَ لَعِبْتُ بِهِ

336
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,040
Just, and the same way this word is used in when you just play,

337
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,160
when you're playing with something and you're just engrossed in the play,

338
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,280
you're lost in the game.

339
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,200
Like some of you are gamers.

340
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm a gamer.

341
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,200
I don't know any other gamers here.

342
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,680
Was it for you?

343
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,240
Alhamdulillah.

344
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,720
Okay, good.

345
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,200
It's okay.

346
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,760
It's okay.

347
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,280
We'll have a support session later on.

348
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,560
Yeah.

349
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:05,760
Right.

350
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,880
When you're really in the game and then,

351
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
doesn't matter who the family member is,

352
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,280
they walk in front of you.

353
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,160
Like you have one hit left on the boss.

354
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,280
It took you so long to get to that one hit.

355
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,120
He's crushed you so many times.

356
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,080
You've almost broken the controller six or seven times now.

357
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,960
And finally there's one hit left and your mother just walks right by

358
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,200
and she doesn't just walk right by.

359
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,640
They just, they pause for a second.

360
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,200
Okay.

361
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,760
What do you want some water?

362
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,640
I don't know.

363
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,280
I don't know what it is,

364
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,800
but I think the women in our families,

365
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,640
they know when to come in front of you.

366
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,120
If you're watching a football game and it's tied and there's 30 seconds left

367
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
and the other team is marching towards the goal line

368
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
and they're already in the penalty.

369
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,120
They're in this area.

370
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,880
That is when your wife will just come right in front of you.

371
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
Do you want some chips?

372
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
And you do this and she'll do this.

373
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,320
Then you do this and she'll do this.

374
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,520
It's a test of your Iman

375
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,440
and the stability of your marriage.

376
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,240
Become really busy with something and you get distracted of all other things.

377
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
You don't remember anything else.

378
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,680
You completely drown yourself in something

379
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
with no consequence of anything besides it.

380
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
So this is actually the meaning of lahu.

381
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,240
Okay.

382
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,920
So now Fahd will talk about it a little bit later.

383
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,040
I'll come back to that,

384
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,560
but I want to give you the narration first.

385
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,840
So behind this surah or behind this ayah,

386
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
there's a story.

387
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,080
There's an event.

388
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,680
And for starters, I will tell you that there's a possibility,

389
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,520
according to some mursal narrations,

390
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,600
that this happened three or more times.

391
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,040
So it didn't happen one time.

392
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,200
It actually happened multiple times.

393
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,880
And to set the stage for this,

394
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
I'll just read through it and whatever part needs explanation,

395
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,640
I'll give you some more details.

396
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,280
Okay.

397
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,360
So this is from Sahih Muslim.

398
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,520
And then Nabi sallallahu alayhi wa sallam

399
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,440
كان يخطب قائم من يولجمع.

400
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,360
And the Fulsa, he salam, used to stand and give the khutbah on the day of Friday.

401
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
فجاءت من عيد من الشام.

402
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,360
من عيد من فجاءت غير من الشام.

403
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
A caravan came from Syria.

404
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:27,760
Okay.

405
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
فَانْتَقَدَ النَّاسُوا إِلَيْهَا

406
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,800
So people rushed towards the caravan.

407
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,160
So we're not getting the details yet.

408
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,480
All we know is the caravan came from Syria.

409
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,240
The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is giving khutbah.

410
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,880
And people got up and they ran over to the caravan.

411
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,960
Now just you understand what a caravan is.

412
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,520
It's a bunch of camels, donkeys, horses, whatever,

413
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,560
with carts.

414
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,160
And they've got wheat, barley, fruits.

415
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,520
They've got clothes.

416
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,320
They've got jewelry.

417
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,080
They've got all kinds of stuff that they're going to sell.

418
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,960
It's like a bazaar.

419
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,240
Right.

420
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,800
And they're coming and they brought all these goods with them.

421
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,560
And what they usually bring with them are women that dance and sing

422
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,280
or children that dance and sing like a little circus.

423
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,480
They're going to do some fire tricks.

424
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
They're going to do some somersaults, entertainment.

425
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,040
They bring a whole show with them.

426
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,000
Right.

427
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,280
So they do that and they bring that in the middle of the city.

428
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,960
There are some places in the city in Medina that were specified for that.

429
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
And that was the time for you to go catch some good shopping.

430
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,520
So people went towards it until only 12 people were left.

431
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,320
So the Prophet says, everybody runs off, only how many?

432
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,200
12 people are left.

433
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,320
Some narrations say 11.

434
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,600
Some narrations say 8.

435
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,960
Some narrations say there's a virus.

436
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,320
And then there are some narrations even say 40.

437
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
There were 40 people left.

438
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,120
But the point is a bunch of people left.

439
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
We don't know the number.

440
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,840
And then the Mufassirun got into a debate who were the 12 that were left.

441
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,560
And then Qurtubi, for example, mentions these were the 12.

442
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,600
Somebody added a 13.

443
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,640
Somebody added a 14.

444
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,520
I won't go into those details because that's not what Allah focused on.

445
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,360
But the event itself, the major details is what we're going to focus on.

446
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,920
Okay.

447
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,640
So anyway,

448
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,760
So anyway,

449
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
And Jabir, radiallahu anhu says,

450
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,640
12 people were left.

451
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,680
I was among them.

452
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,720
That's why he's narrating it.

453
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,160
He's saying I was among them.

454
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,360
Fa'ounzilat hadihil ayah.

455
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
allatifil jumaah.

456
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,040
Then this ayah came, which is in surat al-jumaah.

457
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,000
When they see trade and they see distraction,

458
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,120
they rush towards it.

459
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
They run towards it and they leave you standing.

460
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,000
So this is related to that incident when they went off running off the jumaah.

461
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,960
So the guy who brings the caravan, the business guy that runs the caravan,

462
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,480
his name is Dihya.

463
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,960
Now, Dihya, you might know him from Seerah studies, some of you that may have heard his name before.

464
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,800
He's the person that when Jibril, alaihi salam, used to come in human form,

465
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:01,360
looked a lot like Dihya. Okay, so Dihya is kind of related to some other incidents in the Seerah too.

466
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,400
Anyway, so he comes, he's the one who does the business and he brings this trade caravan with him

467
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:15,520
from Syria. And, this is the important part. He came from Syria at a time of great hunger

468
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,640
prices. This is the important part now. So this caravan didn't just come any time,

469
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,840
it came at a time of great hunger and high prices according to the narration of Sahih Muslim.

470
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,320
Now, why is that important? It seems pretty clear that this happened after Uhud. Some people

471
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,040
argued that this happened after Khaybar. I would strongly disagree because of this,

472
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,080
because of this statement. This happened after Uhud. Let me tell you why. When the Muslims came

473
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,320
back from Khaybar, they became the Muslim community basically came into millions and millions and

474
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,560
millions in wealth. They had wealth they'd never seen before. After what incident? Khaybar. Okay.

475
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,880
In fact, the ayat that discussed what happens after Khaybar talk about faith and faith in Arabic

476
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,960
means the distribution of wealth. So much wealth that we had to now figure out how to distribute

477
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,120
evenly and who's it going to go to? And basically for the first time, the vaults were filled. For

478
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,320
the first time, we had serious amounts of money. That happened after Khaybar. Why would this not

479
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,720
have happened after Khaybar? Because he's coming at a time of what? Hunger and heavy and high prices.

480
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,920
So what does that have to do with Uhud? The people of Makkah, the Sahaba, they left basically all of

481
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,680
the practically all of their assets, their property, their businesses. They left them in Makkah. They

482
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,680
moved to Medina. So they are basically refugees. They don't have any economic benefit that they

483
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,480
bring to Medina other than being able to work, but they don't immediately they don't have any jobs.

484
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,760
Now Medina itself is not a booming economy. It's basically a farming economy and very basic economy.

485
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,840
So they're not very rich people and they decide that they are going to sponsor and give homes to

486
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,240
the people of Makkah, the Muhajirun and the ones that gave them home. Allah says about them,

487
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,720
They gave them preference over themselves even though they themselves were starving.

488
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,360
So what Allah says, means they weren't doing so well themselves. There wasn't a lot of wealth

489
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,640
to go around and now they're already poor to begin with and they are now sponsoring and housing and

490
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,640
giving hospitality to the people of Makkah. That was the situation of the Muhajirun and the Ansar.

491
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,200
Now even then the Ansar, they have every family has a head of household, right? So the man of

492
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,400
the house, if you will, the man, the father, the older sons, etc. They're the ones who work on the

493
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,720
farm. They're the ones who do the trade. They're the ones who go to the well and do all the heavy

494
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,520
work, the labor outside that makes them some money. And you should also know that swords and shields

495
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,760
and bow and arrow, those kinds of things were extremely, extremely expensive and you would

496
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,840
spend your lifetime saving to get a shield. That's why you know when you read about the story of

497
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,200
Badr and we didn't have, we had like this many shields. We had like 12 swords and 15 this and

498
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,880
five horses and you get those, I'm butchering the numbers but you get the idea. We didn't have much.

499
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,680
We didn't have much because those things are extremely, extremely expensive. You understand.

500
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,640
So the people who did have that stuff, it was kind of like their life savings that they had.

501
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:32,720
Now we go into Uhud and in Uhud, 70 Sahaba are killed and the vast majority of the companions

502
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,120
that are killed are actually from Medina. They're actually Madani, which means they are the heads of

503
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,600
households and those Sahaba that are killed, what are they wearing? Shields, whatever they have.

504
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,400
And what do they have in their hands? Sort, basically what they have in their hands and

505
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,480
they're on their bodies is the life savings of their family. Okay, so when they die and the

506
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,680
Mukhans come and they take everything, they take everything. So they've taken people's life savings

507
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,280
and they've also, the people that we've lost in Medina are the people that were the breadwinner,

508
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:13,520
the earner for the family. 70 heads of household have disappeared and 70 families' life savings

509
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,040
have disappeared in a city that's already struggling economically. You understand. So now what's

510
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,040
happened in Medina, Medina is basically going through an economic bankruptcy. Okay, the economy

511
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:31,360
is collapsing. We're in a very, very bad situation and in that bad situation, prices are high,

512
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,000
somebody comes in and is trying to sell some goods that are not available. They're not,

513
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,200
they're not producing as much as they used to produce because they don't have as many workers

514
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,640
anymore. You know, people are struggling and so when a caravan like this comes and now the caravan

515
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,240
came and I told you two things with the caravan, they will bring and we will read what they,

516
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,520
what they brought. I'll read this next part so it'll explain itself.

517
00:25:51,520 --> 00:26:08,160
He's saying he had, they came with essential grocery items. Why would people run towards

518
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,640
essential grocery items unless those grocery items are no longer easily available? You understand?

519
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,280
So they're running towards the bread, the wheat or the rice or the barley or whatever they can

520
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,800
catch because that stuff is not easily available. And I also told you they brought with them, you

521
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,920
know, singers and circus tricks and all that other stuff. When the situation is really bad in

522
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,360
somebody's life, then it's a really attractive thing to distract yourself from all the stresses

523
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,160
in your life and just get away from it all for a little bit, right? Which is why alcohol is so

524
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,080
addictive, which is why drugs are so addictive, which is why video games are so addictive,

525
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,000
which is why social media is so addictive. A lot of times people end up on social media for hours

526
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,360
and hours because they're escaping a reality that they don't want to face, right? They're,

527
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,360
they can't deal with it. A lot of people end up at a bar drinking because they can't deal with what's

528
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,240
going on at home or what's going on with their life. They can't face that reality. So when the

529
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,320
reality becomes difficult, then human beings want to find some comfort in, you know, and some kind

530
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,040
of distraction, you know? If you're, if you're going through a really depressed time or you,

531
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,840
for example, you, you were really working hard on some exam and you failed your exam, you find

532
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,520
yourself watching something all night, can't sleep, distracting yourself. Because when you're

533
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,840
left alone to your thoughts, you have to face the reality of your failure and it's too hard to face.

534
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,200
So you just, let me just watch something. You watch something. Then you put your phone down,

535
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,080
you want to sleep again, you're like, no, let me just watch something again. This is who isn't it.

536
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,320
So it happens when people are in difficulty. So it's not just, oh, they saw some entertainment,

537
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,320
they ran towards it, put it in its context. They were going through a really tough time. And in

538
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,360
those kinds of times, those kinds of things become all the more attractive. They become all the more

539
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,360
entertaining. And you know, I used to, I used to work in a very weird neighborhood in New York

540
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,640
when I was in high school in 1736. It was in, it was in Queens, New York. You might know Queens

541
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,800
from Peter Parker and Spider-Man, but Queens is a crazy place. Queens has neighborhoods that are

542
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,480
entirely Greek. It has neighborhoods that are entirely Puerto Rican and neighborhoods that are

543
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,600
entirely Dominican. Those are two different things. And neighborhoods that are entirely Bangladeshi,

544
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,520
neighborhoods that are entirely Indian, neighborhoods that are entirely, like, and you walk into one

545
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,840
of those neighborhoods and you feel like you just walked into a different country. Each one of those

546
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,360
neighborhoods is like that. There's entirely Jewish neighborhoods, there's Arab neighborhoods,

547
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,720
Steinwitz Street is all the Arab neighborhoods, all the signs are in Arabic. Everybody talks to

548
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,280
you in Arabic. You want to go into a restaurant, nobody's speaking in English. It's crazy. And

549
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,000
then you go to some other neighborhood. Everybody's talking in Spanish, you know? So I used to, I used

550
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,720
to, because, you know, I don't come from like a wealthy family. Everybody in my family had a job.

551
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,960
So even in high school, I had a job. I used to work at a shoe store in Queens in New York

552
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,720
and in the Puerto Rican neighborhood, in the Spanish neighborhood, right, where everybody spoke

553
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,600
Spanish. And I used, because I was the guy, they look at the shoe and they say,

554
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,640
Do you have a size nine? And I have to go run downstairs to the warehouse, find the size nine,

555
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,680
come running back up, right? So sometimes I was pretty decent in Spanish, but then sometimes they

556
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:30,160
just go. And I'm like, no, I don't understand. Excuse me. Could you please repeat that? I didn't

557
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,400
understand. And they go, Viva San Los Estados Unidos. No entiendes español? Yes. They're like,

558
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,320
you live in America, you don't speak Spanish. What's wrong with you?

559
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,840
So, but anyway, the reason I bring that up is because the neighborhood was very poor, man.

560
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,400
It was a poor, people weren't doing well in those neighborhoods, right? But in those neighborhoods,

561
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:06,160
they listen to Bachata and Merengue and hip hop all day. And they are like, they'll buy a car,

562
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:14,880
they'll buy like an old car, but they're gonna like shine it up. And they're gonna put rims that

563
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,800
cost more than their rent on each tire. And if they bought a Honda Civic or something,

564
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,760
they'll put a giant sticker that says Civic on top. Everybody knows it's a Civic, bro. I'm gonna

565
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,720
put your name or something else, but they'll put and they'll drive extra slow. And they'll put the

566
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,720
back in the 90s, they'll put the bumpy on the car like, you know, roll down the street. And you

567
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,680
look at that, why are they so obsessed with this? And then people would come, they make, you know,

568
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,000
those are minimum wage jobs. I had a minimum wage job, we know what we make, barely make enough to

569
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,920
pay the rent and stuff. And the shoes they were selling were like back in the day, these were

570
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:00,320
like high end like, you know, Jordan's and like, you know, like expensive sneakers, right? In a poor,

571
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,120
poor neighborhood. And people come and they literally buy, they'll get paid on Friday. And on

572
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,200
Saturday, they're buying the most expensive sneakers. They're pulling their entire paycheck on a pair

573
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,040
of sneakers. Why though, why you're not going to live in your sneakers. But you know what,

574
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,680
the reality of poverty, the reality of living in a difficult life is so harsh, that when I look at

575
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:31,200
these expensive sneakers, I get to feel like I have something of value. I have value, because

576
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,360
everything around my life has no value. I can't afford a nice place. I can't afford, you know,

577
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,840
a decent apartment. I have to live with eight of my cousins or whatever. But my car, the rims it got,

578
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,040
man, it's like you live out of your car. It becomes an extension of yourselves. And by the way, even

579
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,800
if you get really nice rims, you can't look at them, you're driving. It's for other people to look at.

580
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,840
The perception of me will be I'm doing well. Or I have some kind of status or position or prestige.

581
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,480
And this is in a poor neighborhood. By the way, people in higher society, they have their own

582
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,960
problems. They have their own way of showing prestige and distracting themselves from what's

583
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,760
really going on in their life. So people will say, oh, I have, I'm going through a lot of

584
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,040
depression, I need to go shopping. Life is really hard. I need a new Chanel bag.

585
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:26,800
Right. So they'll do that because this is also, this is also level and distraction. Anyway, so

586
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:35,680
and then the people needed these essentials. And he would do the duffel, like the drum beat,

587
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,160
and the, you know, the hand drums and stuff, the table so that people would know that he's arrived.

588
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:47,680
The by the way, I didn't read that part. This is a location in Medina where the market used to be

589
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,360
held. That's called a jazizate.

590
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,680
And they were in the

591
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,640
So another narration now mentioned in the

592
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,080
Qutni.

593
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,200
At the time the Prophet was giving us a khumba on the day of Friday,

594
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,960
when the caravan, all of a sudden the caravan showed up.

595
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:35,040
It was carrying food and it just, it landed at another location. So it seems from the narration,

596
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,360
one time it comes to a jazizate, another time it comes to a location called

597
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,280
and we will be called a

598
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,520
And so that it sets up in different places from this and other evidences people derive that this

599
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,440
happened multiple times on multiple Fridays, the, you know, the bazaar came and set up. Okay.

600
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,840
This is important. So

601
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,840
in his

602
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,160
means there's some break in the chain. So it's not coming directly a narrative to be

603
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,960
narrated to see there's some break in the chain. Okay. But regardless, this narration seems to be

604
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,360
a really good explanation of what happened. So he's mentioning it despite that he says,

605
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,960
why would they allow themselves to leave listening to the Khutbah because of that?

606
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:33,920
And everybody knows that the Sahaba and the status that they have, it seems that given the way

607
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,320
they are and the character and the morals and the manners that they have, they wouldn't have done that.

608
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,360
So why would they do that?

609
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,080
So he's going to explain that through a narration. Okay.

610
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:54,480
So this is these were the names, but anyway.

611
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,640
This is pretty cool. In the beginning, when, when Jumu'ah first came,

612
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,400
the Prophet, peace be upon him, used to pray to Raka and then give the Khutbah just like we do in Eid.

613
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:18,160
Before the Turaqa used to be first and the Khutbah used to be second. Okay.

614
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,960
Then,

615
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,760
and just like it was, there was the day of Friday and the Prophet, peace be upon him, was giving the

616
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,000
Khutbah and he had already led the Jumu'ah prayer. The prayer was already done and now he was giving

617
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,040
the speech. Okay.

618
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:40,640
Okay.

619
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,160
And said, by the way, Dihya is here. He brought a caravan. The caravan is here, guys.

620
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Somebody walked in and just kind of announced it.

621
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:56,160
And when Dihya came, his people came with doves and drums.

622
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,200
People left because they didn't think that leaving the speech of the Prophet,

623
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,240
peace be upon him, has any harm on the prayer. So the Prophet's giving a talk, but it's not

624
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,400
mandatory attendance. It's just, you know, like if you're sitting listening to a lecture,

625
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,520
you got a phone call and you walked out. I wouldn't be like, where you going?

626
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,000
What you going on with? Because it's not part of the thing. Right. So they didn't think it was

627
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,400
part of the prayer, which is why they walked away. Okay. So,

628
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,360
meaning Allah could have revealed beforehand, don't leave the Khutbah. He allowed this to happen

629
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,320
and then he revealed it because he wanted the Sahaba to experience this, this incident,

630
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,600
where so many of them thought it's harmless. Yeah, we'll just go get some things for our family.

631
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,160
No problem.

632
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,120
The switch happened after the coming of this ayah. Okay.

633
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
And he delayed the prayer.

634
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,800
So the next Friday and the Friday after that and the Friday after that.

635
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,440
And then after that, no one would leave.

636
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,800
If there no started bleeding or anything that happened,

637
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
somebody no started bleeding and they're still, I'm not moving.

638
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,560
Allah gave the ayah, they walked away. I ain't walking away.

639
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,040
Okay. Oh, no matter what happened,

640
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,720
until they would ask the Prophet's license permission, how are they going to ask permission?

641
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,400
They would have to interrupt the Khutbah.

642
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,520
So he says,

643
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,920
meaning the finger that is next to the thumb, meaning your index finger,

644
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,600
somebody who had to leave would be like that to the Prophet's.

645
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Which means, yeah, so long my nose is bleeding.

646
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:05,360
I think I need to go, you know, or I think I broke my pinky or something.

647
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,400
They raised their hand and they just raised their finger like this.

648
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,160
And the Prophet's would say,

649
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,640
indicate with his hand and he can go and that became the adab of the Khutbah.

650
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,760
Like if you were going to get up and go, you can't just walk away.

651
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,240
You would just like indicate to the Prophet quietly and the Prophet's license would give you just

652
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,280
a gesture by your hand. It's okay. And then you could walk out.

653
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,680
Right. So like immediately how it transformed the culture of the Sahaba

654
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,800
and their collective culture, they became just these people of adab.

655
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,440
So among the hypocrites, there were those for whom the Khutbah was really hard to listen to.

656
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,760
Like they didn't want to hear the Khutbah, the hypocrites.

657
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,640
Well, you lose of the Masjid and sitting in the Masjid.

658
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,960
Why I got to sit here? And this be over already?

659
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,680
You know, Wakana, that's by the way, the Khutbahs of the Prophet's was

660
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,120
whatever we have, whatever records we have of any Khutbahs he's given,

661
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,080
those of you that are interested in Arabic, there's a book called Khutbah Rasul,

662
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,800
sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

663
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,240
It's a nice collection of whatever Khutbahs we do have.

664
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,600
Not all of them are Khutbahs or Jumu'ah. Some of them are just public speeches.

665
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,320
But if you actually take a survey of them, they don't last more than two to three minutes.

666
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,280
They're not long speeches at all.

667
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,120
They're just very short speeches, unless the records are just on the summary of what he spoke.

668
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,440
It could be the case too, because the narrations aren't a transcript of his speech.

669
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,440
Somebody's remembering the key points of his speech. It could be like that too, right?

670
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,320
So, but they don't seem like they're very long speeches at all.

671
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,880
Anyway, Wakana is a, is a, that al-Rajulun, middle Muslimin.

672
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,720
So, when a, when a, one of the Muslims would just kind of raise their finger for what purpose?

673
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,720
To get permission?

674
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,720
And then,

675
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,040
and he would kind of walk right next to him, hiding himself with him until he could get out too.

676
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,080
Sounds like those kids in school that like kind of duck and they leave with the other kid.

677
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,680
So,

678
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,840
Allah revealed also, Allah knows the people that slip out behind an excuse.

679
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,920
Allah knows those people too.

680
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,320
Right? So, that's mentioned in Surat al-Nur.

681
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,680
Uh,

682
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,320
is

683
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,320
and it makes it, he feels compelled to believe it because it retains the integrity of the Sahaba.

684
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,920
Radiallahu anhum ajbahim.

685
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,060
Okay.

686
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,280
So, it has reached us, they did this three different times.

687
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,800
Every time it would come from Syria, ah those Syrians.

688
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,680
And then it would, every time it would be right at the time of Friday prayer.

689
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,920
And now it's as if Allah is saying, because he said,

690
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,040
trade and distraction, trade or distraction, those are two separate things.

691
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,160
But one way to interpret it is, as if them looking at that trade opportunity and going to it,

692
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,000
amounts to nothing more than distraction compared to what they were leaving.

693
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,880
So actually, an alternative term for trade was used as distraction.

694
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,400
And it would have been at any other time, there would have been no sin in doing so.

695
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,800
The fact that you were walking away from the Prophet makes this a big deal.

696
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,840
Sorry, this is why it became a big deal.

697
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,680
And that's why the ayah was revealed.

698
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,000
Okay. Now, um, this is just a little bit of a poem, very famous among Arabs.

699
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,280
I'll read it to you.

700
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,520
So the word mal, anyone know what mal means?

701
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,680
Mal means money, but mala, the verb means to incline, to incline.

702
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,640
So it's a play on words.

703
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,720
So you hear mal mal over and over?

704
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,760
It's using both meanings.

705
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,400
It says, I see people who incline towards someone who has money.

706
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,800
And whoever doesn't have money, people don't move towards them.

707
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,480
They move away from him.

708
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,960
What I told Nas, what I told Nas, I got the habit, the habit in Arabic means to go.

709
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,880
But the hub also means gold.

710
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,600
The hubbun means rot.

711
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,000
So, so, but why does the hub and the hub have the same spelling?

712
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,040
It's actually because the Arab philosophy is gold doesn't stay with you.

713
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,480
It goes, somebody gonna kill you or you're gonna die and somebody else gonna take it.

714
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,280
You can't keep it.

715
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,480
It's gonna go.

716
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,920
Interestingly, fadbha in Arabic, fadbha means to break apart and leave.

717
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,360
Fadbha.

718
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,000
And fadbha is silver.

719
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,080
Similar idea.

720
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,200
You can have the silver, but it's gonna break apart and leave.

721
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,560
You're not gonna keep the wealth.

722
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,280
It's gonna go.

723
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,600
Okay.

724
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,240
So fadbha and fadbha, zahaba and zahab, right?

725
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:31,120
I read to Nas, I saw people, they go, ilaman ndahu zahabu, they go towards someone who has gold.

726
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,160
They do zahab to someone who has zahab.

727
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,000
And whoever doesn't have zahab, well, people zahab from him.

728
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,160
I see that people break off and run ilaman ndahu fidda.

729
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
They go towards someone who has silver.

730
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,080
And someone who doesn't have fidda.

731
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,520
Fa'an hunnasumun fadda and people then break away from him.

732
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,200
You don't have many people break away from you.

733
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,440
It's like, you know, some of you guys, you live in, you know, Europe and then you go back home

734
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,200
for vacation or a wedding or aqiqa or your mom's forcing you to marry someone, whatever,

735
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,960
whatever your situation is.

736
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,080
But when you go back, everybody looks at you like, you just came from, you just, you were,

737
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,080
you had climbed up one of the trees of Jannah and you came and you probably have some leaves

738
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,040
of Jannah in your pocket.

739
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,880
So they come to you like, so you got a lot of money, right?

740
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,120
They're always like, let's hang out with them or they're going to take us to the expensive

741
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,920
restaurant. I wonder what, and when you're unpacking your suitcase to take out your smelly clothes,

742
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,680
they think that you have a treasure chest of giveaways for the village.

743
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,440
So they come towards you because you come from the land of the hub and fidda.

744
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,040
Right? And then if you decide you're going to move back and you're not, you know,

745
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,880
you're not going to live in Germany or Canada or Australia or the U.S.

746
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,120
or you're just, then people are like, no, I'm going to, I'm going to zap from you because

747
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,560
you're no longer zap bro. Then your zap days are over. The golden days are gone.

748
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:21,040
Right? So anyway, the, but the idea is that, you know, trade and money is in fact attractive.

749
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,800
Now let's get to the actual, the heart of the matter. I've read the narration to you,

750
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,240
but the main lessons I want to discuss with you in regards to this ayah.

751
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,000
Assalamu alaikum everyone. There are almost 50,000 students around the world

752
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,400
that are interested on top of the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings

753
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,400
and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends. And they need sponsorships,

754
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,480
which is not very expensive. So if you can help sponsor students on Bayanah TV,

755
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,400
please do so and visit our sponsorship page. I appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives

756
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,240
our mission success and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it,

757
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,040
the world over.
