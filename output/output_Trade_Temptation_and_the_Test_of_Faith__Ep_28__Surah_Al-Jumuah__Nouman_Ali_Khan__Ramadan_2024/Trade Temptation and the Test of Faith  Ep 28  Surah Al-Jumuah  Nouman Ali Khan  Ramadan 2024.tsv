0	6240	Which is why social media is so addictive. A lot of times people end up on social media for hours and hours
6240	9560	because they're escaping a reality that they don't want to face.
9560	16240	Right? They can't deal with it. A lot of people end up at a bar drinking because they can't deal with what's going on at home
16240	19600	or what's going on with their life. They can't face that reality.
19600	27080	So when the reality becomes difficult, then human beings want to find some comfort in, you know, some kind of distraction.
27080	31440	So it's not just, oh, they saw some entertainment. They ran towards it, put it in its context.
31440	36880	They were going through a really tough time and in those kinds of times, those kinds of things become all the more attractive.
41640	45200	Salamu alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that
45560	48520	so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on bayanah TV.
48520	54480	I want you to enjoy systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end in brief and then in great detail.
54480	57560	And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanahtv.com.
57560	63760	And once you appreciate what's going on in bayanah TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it and share that subscription with friends and family
63760	65640	and give it as a gift also. Thank you.
65640	67640	Salamu alaikum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuhu.
84480	109800	We are attempting to understand the final ayah of Surah al-Jumu'as, ayah number 11.
109800	112040	A rough translation is what I will start with.
112040	123840	And when they see a trade or distraction, in fadhu ilayha, they run towards it or they disperse towards it.
123840	126960	And they leave you standing.
126960	138960	Tell them what is in Allah's possession is better than distraction and better than trade or business.
139240	141520	Wa Allahul khairul raziqeen.
141520	145040	And Allah is the best of all providers, boys.
145040	147440	Hey boys, hey boys.
147440	150120	Yeah, guys, you're distracting.
150120	152240	So turn this way.
152240	153760	Yeah.
153760	155120	Cool, we're cool.
155120	157640	Okay, very good.
157640	166560	All right, so inshaAllah, so as we wrap up this this ayah, I want to just start with a little bit of vocabulary and then we'll get into it.
166560	173520	There are a few key words, tijara, lahu, infadha, taraka, and then jizq.
173520	175440	Those are the few key words that in this ayah.
175440	179600	So we'll start with tijara so you guys understand that word better.
179600	188800	The word tijara is one of those words in Arabic that is very rare because the ta and the jim, they don't really come together in Arabic in the beginning of a word.
188800	191120	It's the only word in Arabic like that.
191200	195440	So usually Arabic words are made up of three root letters, most of them.
195440	201600	And there's no other word that has ta and jim together like that except for tijara.
201600	205160	The word ittajara, which means to trade or to seek a reward.
205160	210920	Al-amal talaban del-ajar, any work you do hoping that you'll get paid will be called tijara.
210920	213320	So that's the first basic meaning.
213320	217520	Al-tasarru fi raasil maal talaban lirribh.
217520	222560	When you invest, hoping that you'll make some profit from it, investments are also called tijara.
222560	224320	So so far tijara is work.
224320	227120	Anything you're hoping to get paid for, investments.
227120	231040	Ful'anu antajir bi katha ayhaziq bihi a'arifu al-wajha al-muqtasib minhu.
231040	235680	When something is a tajir of something, that means they're really good at it.
235680	237600	And they know how to earn from it.
237600	240920	So like an expert can also be called a tajir.
240920	244080	Okay, someone is a tajir in something, that's their trade.
244120	250040	You know like their trade is so and so, their trade is mechanics, their trade is cars, etc.
250040	251400	So that's another meaning.
261000	268560	Most of the time the word tajir was actually used for the guy that sells wine in the old Arabic before Islam.
268560	271680	They use this word very commonly for the wine seller.
271920	275680	Which he was the one selling the wine, he was also the bartender.
275680	281840	He was the one storing it and they used to sit with him and he would court for them and tell them stories and then they would pay him.
281840	284320	So he was doing all the work, right?
284320	290640	So from the beginning to end and from it they kind of started using that for anybody who makes money doing all kinds of work.
290640	292560	So it kind of expanded in its meaning.
292560	299760	Anyway, now this ayah, another word that we're going to see and I'll just explain the word to you ahead of time,
300400	302000	is the word lahu.
302000	308800	Lahu actually commonly gets translated distraction and you might see for example some short surahs,
308800	311600	you may remember Al-Haqumut Takathur, right?
311600	313440	So al-Ha is from this word, lahu.
314160	320080	And it means, it actually means the back of your throat, the yufila, the thing that's hanging in your throat dangling.
320080	321520	That's actually called al-Haq.
322400	328960	And lohua is, they have those grinders that make the seed into powder, they make the seed into wheat, right?
329680	334160	When they drop the seeds in it, the thing that's dropped in it, that's actually called al-Luhua.
334160	339120	So from it came the idea that when you drop something deep inside, like this thing that's hanging deep inside
339600	341760	and you're dropping the seed inside the grinder.
341760	346720	And from it came the idea that when you are involved in an activity that you get sucked into it.
347120	350880	You just get pulled into it and you kind of get lost in it, right?
351280	353520	That kind of an activity is called lahu.
353520	356960	So for example, if you're, I don't know, watching a movie, playing a game,
357360	362160	you know, you're just scrolling TikTok on your phone or something and you lost track of time and you just,
362160	367760	you got, you get deeper and deeper in it and the world around you stops to exist, right?
367760	370800	And when that happens, then that is a form of lahu.
370800	373360	So from it came the idea of distraction.
373920	376640	This word was used even for the Prophet ﷺ.
376640	378640	Fa anta anhu talaha.
378640	380480	Is surat al-Abasah, right?
380480	383760	Amma ja'aka wa amma man ja'aka yas'a wa huwa yakhshah.
383760	386800	Fa anta anhu talaha, from the same origin, right?
386800	392400	So the Sahabi Abdullah ibn Ummaqtum, he was a relative of the Prophet ﷺ,
392400	396080	a distant relative from the in-law side and he was also blind.
396800	400400	And he came somehow to ask the Prophet a question, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
400400	404480	And the Prophet ﷺ had a rare opportunity to talk to one of the leaders of Quraish.
404480	407600	The leaders of the Quraish, first of all, you can't get a hold of them easily.
407600	411920	But if you do get a rare chance to talk to them, you should take full like, full opportunity
411920	415280	and speak to them as best chance you get, right?
415360	419440	So the Prophet is taking this opportunity to talk to one of the leaders about Islam
419440	422400	and Abdullah ibn Ummaqtum, who's one of his family members,
422400	424640	who actually, because you're family, you have access.
425280	426720	So you can talk to him anytime.
427360	429680	But he came and he interrupted the conversation.
430720	432560	And but he's also blind.
432560	436640	But the thing about being blind is that when you're blind, your other senses are more sharp,
437760	438000	right?
438000	439680	So he's blind, but he's not deaf,
440240	443280	which means he can hear that there's already a conversation going on.
443280	444400	But it didn't matter to him.
444400	451120	He was so feeling such a need of urgency to ask the Prophet ﷺ whatever question he wanted to ask.
451120	452720	So he interrupted the conversation.
453280	457440	Now the Prophet ﷺ did not want to interrupt him and say,
457440	460160	Hey, Abdullah, let me finish this and I'll talk to you.
460160	460960	Just give me a minute.
460960	461760	I'll talk to you.
461760	466000	Even that much the Prophet ﷺ thought would be too harsh for Abdullah.
466800	469120	It would be too much for him because he would say,
469120	472080	I came all this way to ask the Prophet ﷺ and I've now,
472080	473120	and he would feel bad.
473120	473760	I interrupted.
473760	476160	I didn't realize or he would get the wrong idea and say,
476160	477280	Oh, I'm not that important.
477760	478080	Right.
478080	480480	So the Prophet ﷺ did not want to make him feel bad.
481200	484400	And he didn't want to lose the opportunity of talking to the Quraishi leader.
484400	487840	Now he's stuck in the situation where if he talks to Abdullah bin Umqtum,
487840	490800	the Quraishi leader will be like, Oh, I guess you're busy right now.
490800	491280	I'm going to go.
491280	493360	I have other things to do and he's going to walk away.
493360	494640	The opportunity is gone.
494640	497040	So the Prophet ﷺ was stressed about what to do.
497760	500480	And when he was stressed, there was a bulge on his forehead.
500480	501680	This is this is called Abbas.
502320	506320	Like when these lines show up on your forehead and these this comes together.
506320	507040	This is Abbas.
507920	512160	And the Prophet ﷺ just kind of turned his head just a little bit.
512160	513360	You know when you do in frustration,
514160	515760	but no sound came out of his mouth.
515760	516800	No word was said.
516800	518640	And by the way, why wouldn't he say a word?
518640	521040	Because if he says a word, who's going to hear it?
521840	524240	Abdullah will hear it and he's going to feel like something is off.
524800	527120	And if he just does, this is called Ta'awwaha.
529520	530080	Right.
530080	531040	Then he's going to notice.
531680	532480	Who's going to notice that?
532480	533840	So he's going to feel hurt.
533840	534880	So he's not even doing that.
534880	536480	But Allah captures that and says,
538400	539040	He frowned.
539600	540640	He turned his head.
540640	543680	But the thing about turning your head or even turning your face a little bit
544400	548080	is Abdullah, whose supposed feelings are supposed to be hurt,
549280	549920	can't see it.
550720	552000	So there's no way he could get hurt.
553440	555520	But Allah captures that still and says,
555520	556480	Nope, not even that much.
557280	557600	Abbas.
558800	559280	Right.
559360	560960	Now this is what's Allah s.w.
560960	562640	And we're not worth the dust of his feet.
562640	566480	But I can tell you in being in a position of public speaking,
566480	569680	one of the things that's very, very, very difficult
569680	571280	is somebody comes and asks me a question.
571840	574160	And they come and ask me a question and they tell me
574160	576960	that their uncle, when they were five years old,
576960	579040	they took them for a walk and then they said this.
579040	581120	And then their cousin said this and their brother said this.
581120	583440	And also this other time, their grandma,
583440	585360	she was cooking food and then they keep going.
586560	587040	Right.
587040	588560	And they're telling me the entire,
588560	590800	because they say, before I ask my question,
590800	592560	I need you to understand the background.
592560	594400	It all began when I was five years old.
595120	596720	And then by the time I was seven,
596720	598320	and then one time in ninth grade,
598320	600560	and then one time, and the day I got married,
600560	602080	and then after my first baby,
602080	604240	and then, okay, you're almost ready for the question.
604240	604720	Hold on.
605360	607760	And as they're doing that, the people behind them are like,
611520	613920	and now I have to make a choice about,
614800	617760	can I just, can you please get to your question?
617760	620320	Because even if I say, can you please get to your question,
620320	621200	what might they feel?
621760	623120	Oh my God, he has no patience for me.
623120	625040	He doesn't want to hear what I have to say, how rude.
625040	626960	I had listened to so many hours of you.
626960	628240	I have gone to sleep.
628240	630560	I have gone to sleep for 10 years listening to you,
630560	632480	and you couldn't even hear about my uncle.
635680	638560	We, you know, but in my head, I'm thinking,
639200	642880	if I am not going to cut the short,
642880	645520	then the other person's going to think I'm being rude to them.
646160	646640	Right?
646640	648960	And then there's a few hundred of you.
648960	650160	There's one of me.
650160	650400	Right?
650400	652000	So if I give each of you one minute,
653120	656640	right, just one minute, that would be how many minutes?
656640	657840	That'd be 400 minutes.
658560	661840	And each one of you would feel like I only got one minute.
663040	664720	And I would feel like I'm almost dead.
666160	666560	Because,
669200	671920	so when you're in a position of any kind of leadership,
671920	673200	sometimes you are,
673200	674640	and this is not just in public speaking,
674640	676000	parents, for example,
676000	678320	three of your kids come and talk to you at the same time.
678320	678800	And you have,
678800	679920	you can't talk to all three of them
679920	680960	because you only have one mouth.
682000	682560	Right?
682560	684000	So you decide to pick one of them.
684000	685840	And what did the other two feel all of a sudden?
687200	688320	All of a sudden, they feel like,
688320	691040	oh yeah, okay, yeah, listen to her first.
691040	691280	Yeah.
692480	693280	She's the favorite.
694640	694880	Right?
694880	696560	Or you hear in the background, you hear,
699600	700720	you know, whatever.
701920	703680	You hear that just on the little bit of,
704400	704800	you know.
705600	708480	So there's this difficult position he was put in.
708480	710800	And Allah even captured that and said,
710800	712080	for a moment,
712080	715760	you got distracted from the blind Sahabi
715760	718880	because you were trying to get the message across to the leader.
718880	721840	I don't want you to worry about the leaders ever,
721840	722960	more than I want you to worry
722960	724800	about the weakest of your companions.
724800	726000	They are my VIPs.
727280	728320	That's not my VIP.
728320	729440	Those are my VIPs.
729440	730560	In the world's eyes,
730560	732240	the millionaire, the billionaire,
732240	734800	if I had a chance to give Bawah to Elon Musk
734800	737440	or if I had a chance to talk to Jeff Bezos about Zakat
737440	738720	or something, you know,
740560	742240	that's a huge opportunity.
742240	743920	And then there's a guy who doesn't have a job,
744560	747680	who's, you know, he's trying to make whatever money he can,
747680	748720	driving an Uber,
748720	749920	and he's not making his expenses.
749920	751040	And he has a question.
751040	752080	And all of a sudden, I'm like,
752080	754080	what's going to be a bigger benefit to Islam?
754080	756800	If I can get Jeff Bezos Zakat money,
756800	758560	or if I can, you know, talk,
758560	760080	and Allah is teaching a powerful lesson
760080	760880	to the Prophet's life,
761680	762480	that he, you know,
764640	765520	and Allah says,
768640	770320	and the one who came to you rushing,
770960	772320	Allah mentions Yas'a.
772320	773200	You know how hard it is
773200	774560	for a blind person to walk fast?
775840	776800	Allah acknowledges that.
777840	778320	And he says,
778880	780560	and he's afraid that he might disobey Allah.
780560	782720	He's got, he's full of fear of Allah.
782720	784320	And the more you are mindful of Allah,
784320	785120	the more Allah is,
785760	786080	Allah says,
787200	789360	you remember me, I will remember you.
789360	791280	So Allah is now remembering him.
792640	793120	And he says,
797200	799200	You got too busy that you couldn't give him attention.
799200	801280	And it's not like the Prophet wasn't giving him attention.
801280	801600	He was just,
802400	804240	just had a turn of the head.
804240	806560	But the standard is very high for our messenger,
806560	807760	Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.
807760	808880	And if that's the standard,
808880	811040	and we say, you know, we, I hear,
811040	812640	sometimes I hear things and I just say,
812640	814960	really, do you really believe that?
814960	815760	Because he was like,
815760	817360	bro, we have to follow Quran and Sunnah.
817920	818720	Quran and Sunnah.
820240	821200	How many times do you hear that?
821200	822320	Quran and Sunnah.
822320	822960	I was like, okay.
824000	825360	Oh, what do you mean by Quran and Sunnah?
825360	826560	Well, you know, the miswak,
827680	828800	the beard,
829440	830160	the beard size,
830160	832640	let's check the beard size to make sure that it's on the Sunnah.
833440	835280	Let's make sure that, you know, the clothing.
835280	836160	And you know what,
836160	837600	some of those things can be argued,
837600	839280	but there are some things that cannot be argued.
839920	843120	There are multiple variations of how to interpret some of those Sunnah
843120	843680	of the Prophet's life.
843680	844720	So I'm fine.
844720	846240	But there are some things that are unargu,
846240	848160	inarguable, how to treat people.
848160	849280	There's no ambiguity.
850080	851200	Sunnahs of the Prophet's life.
852240	853280	Where are those Sunnahs, bro?
854640	855680	Where did those Sunnahs go?
856480	857520	What, that's not Quran?
857520	858960	That's not Sunnah, you know?
859600	862160	So we also get distracted by certain things
862960	864400	in the face of other things.
864400	866080	And we've come up with our own,
866080	867600	you know, we have to do the greater good.
868640	869840	And you could do a lot of bad things
869840	870720	and hurt a lot of bad,
870720	873040	a lot of people because you're worried about the greater good.
873760	874160	You know?
874800	876160	So this, anyway,
876160	878320	so that's a side nobody about lehu,
878320	881760	lehu actually means to get distracted by something
881760	883760	that keeps you from something more important.
884880	885200	Right?
885200	886640	It keeps you from something more important.
886640	887840	That's happened sometimes to me,
887840	891200	like I'm going to a doctor's appointment or something,
891760	894000	and I'm not going to get a chance to get this appointment.
894000	896480	It was like six months waiting or something.
896480	898400	And I got a chance, and I have a work meeting.
898400	900240	And what happens with me with work meetings is,
900240	900960	I don't know what it is.
900960	903120	I have to drive while I'm having a meeting.
903120	905440	I can't, I can't sit and have a meeting.
905920	907760	I have to be walking, driving, doing something.
908480	910320	And the more, the more intense the meeting is,
910320	911520	the more straight I drive.
912320	914480	So I missed the exit because I'm having a meeting.
914480	915360	I'm like, what did you say?
915920	919120	I'm like, oh, ghosting meeting.
919760	920560	That's also lehu.
921440	924880	Lehu because one thing distracted me from something else.
924880	926080	That's, that's the meaning of that.
926080	926240	Okay.
926240	928800	So there's just some vocabulary that I want you to know.
929600	933840	And lehi, lehi to be shayin also means to fall in love with something,
934720	936160	to actually fall in love with something.
936160	938240	Like you're just completely enveloped in it.
938240	941200	You know, like you lost in love, the idea of lost in love.
941200	943360	You just fell on fallen in love.
944240	945920	That's how it's used actually in Arabic.
945920	947520	وَكَذَا دِكَ لَعِبْتُ بِهِ
947520	951040	Just, and the same way this word is used in when you just play,
951040	954160	when you're playing with something and you're just engrossed in the play,
954160	955280	you're lost in the game.
955840	957200	Like some of you are gamers.
957200	957760	I'm a gamer.
957760	959200	I don't know any other gamers here.
959200	959680	Was it for you?
959680	960240	Alhamdulillah.
960240	960720	Okay, good.
960720	961200	It's okay.
961200	961760	It's okay.
961760	963280	We'll have a support session later on.
964400	964560	Yeah.
965520	965760	Right.
965760	968880	When you're really in the game and then,
968880	970320	doesn't matter who the family member is,
970320	971280	they walk in front of you.
972240	974160	Like you have one hit left on the boss.
974160	977280	It took you so long to get to that one hit.
977280	979120	He's crushed you so many times.
979120	982080	You've almost broken the controller six or seven times now.
982720	986960	And finally there's one hit left and your mother just walks right by
988000	989200	and she doesn't just walk right by.
989200	990640	They just, they pause for a second.
990640	991200	Okay.
992720	993760	What do you want some water?
1002160	1002640	I don't know.
1002640	1003280	I don't know what it is,
1003280	1004800	but I think the women in our families,
1005520	1008640	they know when to come in front of you.
1010240	1015120	If you're watching a football game and it's tied and there's 30 seconds left
1015680	1018320	and the other team is marching towards the goal line
1018320	1020320	and they're already in the penalty.
1020320	1021120	They're in this area.
1021760	1024880	That is when your wife will just come right in front of you.
1025760	1026640	Do you want some chips?
1027760	1029760	And you do this and she'll do this.
1030560	1032320	Then you do this and she'll do this.
1034240	1035520	It's a test of your Iman
1037840	1039440	and the stability of your marriage.
1044880	1048240	Become really busy with something and you get distracted of all other things.
1048240	1050080	You don't remember anything else.
1050800	1057680	You completely drown yourself in something
1058720	1061840	with no consequence of anything besides it.
1061840	1064000	So this is actually the meaning of lahu.
1064000	1064240	Okay.
1064240	1065920	So now Fahd will talk about it a little bit later.
1065920	1067040	I'll come back to that,
1067040	1068560	but I want to give you the narration first.
1068560	1071840	So behind this surah or behind this ayah,
1071840	1072960	there's a story.
1072960	1074080	There's an event.
1074080	1077680	And for starters, I will tell you that there's a possibility,
1077680	1079520	according to some mursal narrations,
1079520	1081600	that this happened three or more times.
1081600	1083040	So it didn't happen one time.
1083040	1085200	It actually happened multiple times.
1085200	1086880	And to set the stage for this,
1086880	1089440	I'll just read through it and whatever part needs explanation,
1089440	1090640	I'll give you some more details.
1090640	1091280	Okay.
1091280	1093360	So this is from Sahih Muslim.
1093920	1095520	And then Nabi sallallahu alayhi wa sallam
1095520	1097440	كان يخطب قائم من يولجمع.
1097440	1101360	And the Fulsa, he salam, used to stand and give the khutbah on the day of Friday.
1101360	1102960	فجاءت من عيد من الشام.
1102960	1105360	من عيد من فجاءت غير من الشام.
1105360	1107520	A caravan came from Syria.
1107520	1107760	Okay.
1108480	1110080	فَانْتَقَدَ النَّاسُوا إِلَيْهَا
1110080	1112800	So people rushed towards the caravan.
1112800	1114160	So we're not getting the details yet.
1114160	1116480	All we know is the caravan came from Syria.
1116480	1118240	The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is giving khutbah.
1118240	1120880	And people got up and they ran over to the caravan.
1120880	1122960	Now just you understand what a caravan is.
1122960	1125520	It's a bunch of camels, donkeys, horses, whatever,
1125520	1126560	with carts.
1126560	1130160	And they've got wheat, barley, fruits.
1130160	1131520	They've got clothes.
1131520	1132320	They've got jewelry.
1132320	1134080	They've got all kinds of stuff that they're going to sell.
1134080	1134960	It's like a bazaar.
1135680	1136240	Right.
1136320	1138800	And they're coming and they brought all these goods with them.
1138800	1142560	And what they usually bring with them are women that dance and sing
1142560	1145280	or children that dance and sing like a little circus.
1145280	1146480	They're going to do some fire tricks.
1146480	1148640	They're going to do some somersaults, entertainment.
1148640	1151040	They bring a whole show with them.
1151760	1152000	Right.
1152000	1155280	So they do that and they bring that in the middle of the city.
1155280	1158960	There are some places in the city in Medina that were specified for that.
1158960	1162480	And that was the time for you to go catch some good shopping.
1163440	1169520	So people went towards it until only 12 people were left.
1170240	1174320	So the Prophet says, everybody runs off, only how many?
1174320	1175200	12 people are left.
1175200	1176320	Some narrations say 11.
1176320	1177600	Some narrations say 8.
1177600	1178960	Some narrations say there's a virus.
1183280	1188320	And then there are some narrations even say 40.
1188320	1189520	There were 40 people left.
1189520	1191120	But the point is a bunch of people left.
1191120	1192160	We don't know the number.
1192240	1195840	And then the Mufassirun got into a debate who were the 12 that were left.
1195840	1198560	And then Qurtubi, for example, mentions these were the 12.
1198560	1199600	Somebody added a 13.
1199600	1200640	Somebody added a 14.
1200640	1203520	I won't go into those details because that's not what Allah focused on.
1204080	1207360	But the event itself, the major details is what we're going to focus on.
1207360	1207920	Okay.
1207920	1208640	So anyway,
1211280	1211760	So anyway,
1211760	1213760	And Jabir, radiallahu anhu says,
1213760	1214640	12 people were left.
1214640	1215680	I was among them.
1215680	1216720	That's why he's narrating it.
1216720	1218160	He's saying I was among them.
1218160	1219360	Fa'ounzilat hadihil ayah.
1219360	1220480	allatifil jumaah.
1220480	1223040	Then this ayah came, which is in surat al-jumaah.
1223040	1226000	When they see trade and they see distraction,
1226000	1227120	they rush towards it.
1227120	1229520	They run towards it and they leave you standing.
1230240	1234000	So this is related to that incident when they went off running off the jumaah.
1241280	1244960	So the guy who brings the caravan, the business guy that runs the caravan,
1244960	1246480	his name is Dihya.
1246480	1250960	Now, Dihya, you might know him from Seerah studies, some of you that may have heard his name before.
1250960	1254800	He's the person that when Jibril, alaihi salam, used to come in human form,
1254800	1261360	looked a lot like Dihya. Okay, so Dihya is kind of related to some other incidents in the Seerah too.
1261360	1266400	Anyway, so he comes, he's the one who does the business and he brings this trade caravan with him
1266400	1275520	from Syria. And, this is the important part. He came from Syria at a time of great hunger
1276080	1280640	prices. This is the important part now. So this caravan didn't just come any time,
1280640	1285840	it came at a time of great hunger and high prices according to the narration of Sahih Muslim.
1285840	1292320	Now, why is that important? It seems pretty clear that this happened after Uhud. Some people
1292320	1297040	argued that this happened after Khaybar. I would strongly disagree because of this,
1297040	1302080	because of this statement. This happened after Uhud. Let me tell you why. When the Muslims came
1302080	1308320	back from Khaybar, they became the Muslim community basically came into millions and millions and
1308320	1314560	millions in wealth. They had wealth they'd never seen before. After what incident? Khaybar. Okay.
1314560	1320880	In fact, the ayat that discussed what happens after Khaybar talk about faith and faith in Arabic
1320880	1326960	means the distribution of wealth. So much wealth that we had to now figure out how to distribute
1327200	1333120	evenly and who's it going to go to? And basically for the first time, the vaults were filled. For
1333120	1338320	the first time, we had serious amounts of money. That happened after Khaybar. Why would this not
1338320	1344720	have happened after Khaybar? Because he's coming at a time of what? Hunger and heavy and high prices.
1344720	1351920	So what does that have to do with Uhud? The people of Makkah, the Sahaba, they left basically all of
1351920	1355680	the practically all of their assets, their property, their businesses. They left them in Makkah. They
1355680	1361680	moved to Medina. So they are basically refugees. They don't have any economic benefit that they
1361680	1366480	bring to Medina other than being able to work, but they don't immediately they don't have any jobs.
1366480	1373760	Now Medina itself is not a booming economy. It's basically a farming economy and very basic economy.
1373760	1379840	So they're not very rich people and they decide that they are going to sponsor and give homes to
1379840	1384240	the people of Makkah, the Muhajirun and the ones that gave them home. Allah says about them,
1386080	1390720	They gave them preference over themselves even though they themselves were starving.
1391520	1397360	So what Allah says, means they weren't doing so well themselves. There wasn't a lot of wealth
1397360	1402640	to go around and now they're already poor to begin with and they are now sponsoring and housing and
1402640	1408640	giving hospitality to the people of Makkah. That was the situation of the Muhajirun and the Ansar.
1408640	1415200	Now even then the Ansar, they have every family has a head of household, right? So the man of
1415200	1420400	the house, if you will, the man, the father, the older sons, etc. They're the ones who work on the
1420400	1424720	farm. They're the ones who do the trade. They're the ones who go to the well and do all the heavy
1424720	1431520	work, the labor outside that makes them some money. And you should also know that swords and shields
1432080	1437760	and bow and arrow, those kinds of things were extremely, extremely expensive and you would
1437760	1443840	spend your lifetime saving to get a shield. That's why you know when you read about the story of
1443840	1449200	Badr and we didn't have, we had like this many shields. We had like 12 swords and 15 this and
1449200	1454880	five horses and you get those, I'm butchering the numbers but you get the idea. We didn't have much.
1454880	1459680	We didn't have much because those things are extremely, extremely expensive. You understand.
1459680	1464640	So the people who did have that stuff, it was kind of like their life savings that they had.
1465280	1472720	Now we go into Uhud and in Uhud, 70 Sahaba are killed and the vast majority of the companions
1472720	1479120	that are killed are actually from Medina. They're actually Madani, which means they are the heads of
1479120	1485600	households and those Sahaba that are killed, what are they wearing? Shields, whatever they have.
1486160	1490400	And what do they have in their hands? Sort, basically what they have in their hands and
1490400	1496480	they're on their bodies is the life savings of their family. Okay, so when they die and the
1496480	1501680	Mukhans come and they take everything, they take everything. So they've taken people's life savings
1502480	1507280	and they've also, the people that we've lost in Medina are the people that were the breadwinner,
1507280	1513520	the earner for the family. 70 heads of household have disappeared and 70 families' life savings
1513520	1519040	have disappeared in a city that's already struggling economically. You understand. So now what's
1519040	1525040	happened in Medina, Medina is basically going through an economic bankruptcy. Okay, the economy
1525040	1531360	is collapsing. We're in a very, very bad situation and in that bad situation, prices are high,
1532080	1536000	somebody comes in and is trying to sell some goods that are not available. They're not,
1536000	1539200	they're not producing as much as they used to produce because they don't have as many workers
1539200	1544640	anymore. You know, people are struggling and so when a caravan like this comes and now the caravan
1544640	1548240	came and I told you two things with the caravan, they will bring and we will read what they,
1548240	1551520	what they brought. I'll read this next part so it'll explain itself.
1551520	1568160	He's saying he had, they came with essential grocery items. Why would people run towards
1568160	1574640	essential grocery items unless those grocery items are no longer easily available? You understand?
1574640	1579280	So they're running towards the bread, the wheat or the rice or the barley or whatever they can
1579280	1584800	catch because that stuff is not easily available. And I also told you they brought with them, you
1584800	1589920	know, singers and circus tricks and all that other stuff. When the situation is really bad in
1589920	1595360	somebody's life, then it's a really attractive thing to distract yourself from all the stresses
1595360	1602160	in your life and just get away from it all for a little bit, right? Which is why alcohol is so
1602160	1608080	addictive, which is why drugs are so addictive, which is why video games are so addictive,
1608720	1614000	which is why social media is so addictive. A lot of times people end up on social media for hours
1614000	1619360	and hours because they're escaping a reality that they don't want to face, right? They're,
1619360	1623360	they can't deal with it. A lot of people end up at a bar drinking because they can't deal with what's
1623360	1628240	going on at home or what's going on with their life. They can't face that reality. So when the
1628240	1634320	reality becomes difficult, then human beings want to find some comfort in, you know, and some kind
1634400	1639040	of distraction, you know? If you're, if you're going through a really depressed time or you,
1639040	1643840	for example, you, you were really working hard on some exam and you failed your exam, you find
1643840	1649520	yourself watching something all night, can't sleep, distracting yourself. Because when you're
1649520	1653840	left alone to your thoughts, you have to face the reality of your failure and it's too hard to face.
1653840	1657200	So you just, let me just watch something. You watch something. Then you put your phone down,
1657200	1662080	you want to sleep again, you're like, no, let me just watch something again. This is who isn't it.
1662160	1666320	So it happens when people are in difficulty. So it's not just, oh, they saw some entertainment,
1666320	1670320	they ran towards it, put it in its context. They were going through a really tough time. And in
1670320	1675360	those kinds of times, those kinds of things become all the more attractive. They become all the more
1675360	1681360	entertaining. And you know, I used to, I used to work in a very weird neighborhood in New York
1681360	1686640	when I was in high school in 1736. It was in, it was in Queens, New York. You might know Queens
1686640	1692800	from Peter Parker and Spider-Man, but Queens is a crazy place. Queens has neighborhoods that are
1692800	1698480	entirely Greek. It has neighborhoods that are entirely Puerto Rican and neighborhoods that are
1698480	1703600	entirely Dominican. Those are two different things. And neighborhoods that are entirely Bangladeshi,
1703600	1707520	neighborhoods that are entirely Indian, neighborhoods that are entirely, like, and you walk into one
1707520	1711840	of those neighborhoods and you feel like you just walked into a different country. Each one of those
1711840	1715360	neighborhoods is like that. There's entirely Jewish neighborhoods, there's Arab neighborhoods,
1715360	1718720	Steinwitz Street is all the Arab neighborhoods, all the signs are in Arabic. Everybody talks to
1718720	1723280	you in Arabic. You want to go into a restaurant, nobody's speaking in English. It's crazy. And
1723280	1728000	then you go to some other neighborhood. Everybody's talking in Spanish, you know? So I used to, I used
1728000	1732720	to, because, you know, I don't come from like a wealthy family. Everybody in my family had a job.
1732720	1738960	So even in high school, I had a job. I used to work at a shoe store in Queens in New York
1738960	1742720	and in the Puerto Rican neighborhood, in the Spanish neighborhood, right, where everybody spoke
1742720	1747600	Spanish. And I used, because I was the guy, they look at the shoe and they say,
1747600	1754640	Do you have a size nine? And I have to go run downstairs to the warehouse, find the size nine,
1754640	1759680	come running back up, right? So sometimes I was pretty decent in Spanish, but then sometimes they
1759680	1770160	just go. And I'm like, no, I don't understand. Excuse me. Could you please repeat that? I didn't
1770160	1776400	understand. And they go, Viva San Los Estados Unidos. No entiendes español? Yes. They're like,
1776400	1778320	you live in America, you don't speak Spanish. What's wrong with you?
1785360	1791840	So, but anyway, the reason I bring that up is because the neighborhood was very poor, man.
1791840	1798400	It was a poor, people weren't doing well in those neighborhoods, right? But in those neighborhoods,
1798400	1806160	they listen to Bachata and Merengue and hip hop all day. And they are like, they'll buy a car,
1806160	1814880	they'll buy like an old car, but they're gonna like shine it up. And they're gonna put rims that
1814880	1820800	cost more than their rent on each tire. And if they bought a Honda Civic or something,
1820800	1825760	they'll put a giant sticker that says Civic on top. Everybody knows it's a Civic, bro. I'm gonna
1825760	1830720	put your name or something else, but they'll put and they'll drive extra slow. And they'll put the
1830720	1838720	back in the 90s, they'll put the bumpy on the car like, you know, roll down the street. And you
1838720	1845680	look at that, why are they so obsessed with this? And then people would come, they make, you know,
1845680	1850000	those are minimum wage jobs. I had a minimum wage job, we know what we make, barely make enough to
1850000	1853920	pay the rent and stuff. And the shoes they were selling were like back in the day, these were
1853920	1860320	like high end like, you know, Jordan's and like, you know, like expensive sneakers, right? In a poor,
1860320	1865120	poor neighborhood. And people come and they literally buy, they'll get paid on Friday. And on
1865120	1871200	Saturday, they're buying the most expensive sneakers. They're pulling their entire paycheck on a pair
1871200	1877040	of sneakers. Why though, why you're not going to live in your sneakers. But you know what,
1877760	1883680	the reality of poverty, the reality of living in a difficult life is so harsh, that when I look at
1883680	1891200	these expensive sneakers, I get to feel like I have something of value. I have value, because
1891200	1897360	everything around my life has no value. I can't afford a nice place. I can't afford, you know,
1897360	1901840	a decent apartment. I have to live with eight of my cousins or whatever. But my car, the rims it got,
1901840	1907040	man, it's like you live out of your car. It becomes an extension of yourselves. And by the way, even
1907040	1912800	if you get really nice rims, you can't look at them, you're driving. It's for other people to look at.
1913840	1919840	The perception of me will be I'm doing well. Or I have some kind of status or position or prestige.
1919840	1924480	And this is in a poor neighborhood. By the way, people in higher society, they have their own
1924480	1928960	problems. They have their own way of showing prestige and distracting themselves from what's
1928960	1933760	really going on in their life. So people will say, oh, I have, I'm going through a lot of
1933760	1939040	depression, I need to go shopping. Life is really hard. I need a new Chanel bag.
1939040	1946800	Right. So they'll do that because this is also, this is also level and distraction. Anyway, so
1947360	1955680	and then the people needed these essentials. And he would do the duffel, like the drum beat,
1955680	1960160	and the, you know, the hand drums and stuff, the table so that people would know that he's arrived.
1960160	1967680	The by the way, I didn't read that part. This is a location in Medina where the market used to be
1968160	1969360	held. That's called a jazizate.
1975760	1976680	And they were in the
1985680	1988640	So another narration now mentioned in the
1989360	1990080	Qutni.
1994240	1997200	At the time the Prophet was giving us a khumba on the day of Friday,
1998880	2002960	when the caravan, all of a sudden the caravan showed up.
2006560	2015040	It was carrying food and it just, it landed at another location. So it seems from the narration,
2015040	2019360	one time it comes to a jazizate, another time it comes to a location called
2019360	2021280	and we will be called a
2022400	2027520	And so that it sets up in different places from this and other evidences people derive that this
2027520	2033440	happened multiple times on multiple Fridays, the, you know, the bazaar came and set up. Okay.
2040160	2041840	This is important. So
2042400	2043840	in his
2046320	2050160	means there's some break in the chain. So it's not coming directly a narrative to be
2050160	2054960	narrated to see there's some break in the chain. Okay. But regardless, this narration seems to be
2054960	2059360	a really good explanation of what happened. So he's mentioning it despite that he says,
2059360	2064960	why would they allow themselves to leave listening to the Khutbah because of that?
2065920	2073920	And everybody knows that the Sahaba and the status that they have, it seems that given the way
2073920	2078320	they are and the character and the morals and the manners that they have, they wouldn't have done that.
2078320	2079360	So why would they do that?
2081200	2084080	So he's going to explain that through a narration. Okay.
2084400	2094480	So this is these were the names, but anyway.
2100480	2104640	This is pretty cool. In the beginning, when, when Jumu'ah first came,
2105600	2110400	the Prophet, peace be upon him, used to pray to Raka and then give the Khutbah just like we do in Eid.
2110880	2118160	Before the Turaqa used to be first and the Khutbah used to be second. Okay.
2118160	2118960	Then,
2122160	2125760	and just like it was, there was the day of Friday and the Prophet, peace be upon him, was giving the
2125760	2132000	Khutbah and he had already led the Jumu'ah prayer. The prayer was already done and now he was giving
2132000	2133040	the speech. Okay.
2133040	2140640	Okay.
2140800	2146160	And said, by the way, Dihya is here. He brought a caravan. The caravan is here, guys.
2146640	2148640	Somebody walked in and just kind of announced it.
2149040	2156160	And when Dihya came, his people came with doves and drums.
2161920	2165200	People left because they didn't think that leaving the speech of the Prophet,
2165200	2170240	peace be upon him, has any harm on the prayer. So the Prophet's giving a talk, but it's not
2170240	2174400	mandatory attendance. It's just, you know, like if you're sitting listening to a lecture,
2174400	2177520	you got a phone call and you walked out. I wouldn't be like, where you going?
2178720	2184000	What you going on with? Because it's not part of the thing. Right. So they didn't think it was
2184000	2188400	part of the prayer, which is why they walked away. Okay. So,
2195760	2201360	meaning Allah could have revealed beforehand, don't leave the Khutbah. He allowed this to happen
2201360	2206320	and then he revealed it because he wanted the Sahaba to experience this, this incident,
2206320	2209600	where so many of them thought it's harmless. Yeah, we'll just go get some things for our family.
2209600	2210160	No problem.
2222480	2225120	The switch happened after the coming of this ayah. Okay.
2226080	2228080	And he delayed the prayer.
2232080	2234800	So the next Friday and the Friday after that and the Friday after that.
2235600	2237440	And then after that, no one would leave.
2238720	2242800	If there no started bleeding or anything that happened,
2242800	2246160	somebody no started bleeding and they're still, I'm not moving.
2246800	2250560	Allah gave the ayah, they walked away. I ain't walking away.
2250640	2253040	Okay. Oh, no matter what happened,
2257440	2260720	until they would ask the Prophet's license permission, how are they going to ask permission?
2260720	2262400	They would have to interrupt the Khutbah.
2263040	2263520	So he says,
2268240	2271920	meaning the finger that is next to the thumb, meaning your index finger,
2271920	2275600	somebody who had to leave would be like that to the Prophet's.
2276160	2278160	Which means, yeah, so long my nose is bleeding.
2279120	2285360	I think I need to go, you know, or I think I broke my pinky or something.
2285360	2288400	They raised their hand and they just raised their finger like this.
2288400	2290160	And the Prophet's would say,
2296400	2300640	indicate with his hand and he can go and that became the adab of the Khutbah.
2301200	2303760	Like if you were going to get up and go, you can't just walk away.
2303760	2308240	You would just like indicate to the Prophet quietly and the Prophet's license would give you just
2308240	2311280	a gesture by your hand. It's okay. And then you could walk out.
2311920	2317680	Right. So like immediately how it transformed the culture of the Sahaba
2318400	2322800	and their collective culture, they became just these people of adab.
2326800	2331440	So among the hypocrites, there were those for whom the Khutbah was really hard to listen to.
2331520	2333760	Like they didn't want to hear the Khutbah, the hypocrites.
2334560	2336640	Well, you lose of the Masjid and sitting in the Masjid.
2338480	2340960	Why I got to sit here? And this be over already?
2341440	2345680	You know, Wakana, that's by the way, the Khutbahs of the Prophet's was
2345680	2349120	whatever we have, whatever records we have of any Khutbahs he's given,
2349120	2352080	those of you that are interested in Arabic, there's a book called Khutbah Rasul,
2352080	2352800	sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.
2353760	2356240	It's a nice collection of whatever Khutbahs we do have.
2356240	2359600	Not all of them are Khutbahs or Jumu'ah. Some of them are just public speeches.
2359600	2364320	But if you actually take a survey of them, they don't last more than two to three minutes.
2365200	2367280	They're not long speeches at all.
2368320	2373120	They're just very short speeches, unless the records are just on the summary of what he spoke.
2373680	2377440	It could be the case too, because the narrations aren't a transcript of his speech.
2378080	2381440	Somebody's remembering the key points of his speech. It could be like that too, right?
2381440	2384320	So, but they don't seem like they're very long speeches at all.
2384320	2388880	Anyway, Wakana is a, is a, that al-Rajulun, middle Muslimin.
2388960	2392720	So, when a, when a, one of the Muslims would just kind of raise their finger for what purpose?
2394000	2394720	To get permission?
2400320	2400720	And then,
2403280	2407040	and he would kind of walk right next to him, hiding himself with him until he could get out too.
2408400	2414080	Sounds like those kids in school that like kind of duck and they leave with the other kid.
2419200	2419680	So,
2421680	2425840	Allah revealed also, Allah knows the people that slip out behind an excuse.
2426720	2427920	Allah knows those people too.
2428720	2430320	Right? So, that's mentioned in Surat al-Nur.
2431120	2431680	Uh,
2439680	2440320	is
2440320	2446320	and it makes it, he feels compelled to believe it because it retains the integrity of the Sahaba.
2446880	2447920	Radiallahu anhum ajbahim.
2448560	2449060	Okay.
2452160	2455280	So, it has reached us, they did this three different times.
2461520	2464800	Every time it would come from Syria, ah those Syrians.
2464800	2469680	And then it would, every time it would be right at the time of Friday prayer.
2477280	2479920	And now it's as if Allah is saying, because he said,
2480640	2485040	trade and distraction, trade or distraction, those are two separate things.
2485040	2490160	But one way to interpret it is, as if them looking at that trade opportunity and going to it,
2490160	2494000	amounts to nothing more than distraction compared to what they were leaving.
2494720	2498880	So actually, an alternative term for trade was used as distraction.
2499440	2506400	And it would have been at any other time, there would have been no sin in doing so.
2513680	2516800	The fact that you were walking away from the Prophet makes this a big deal.
2517520	2519840	Sorry, this is why it became a big deal.
2519840	2521680	And that's why the ayah was revealed.
2522560	2528000	Okay. Now, um, this is just a little bit of a poem, very famous among Arabs.
2528000	2529280	I'll read it to you.
2529280	2531520	So the word mal, anyone know what mal means?
2532720	2537680	Mal means money, but mala, the verb means to incline, to incline.
2537680	2538640	So it's a play on words.
2546640	2548720	So you hear mal mal over and over?
2548720	2549760	It's using both meanings.
2549760	2554400	It says, I see people who incline towards someone who has money.
2554960	2558800	And whoever doesn't have money, people don't move towards them.
2558800	2560480	They move away from him.
2560480	2564960	What I told Nas, what I told Nas, I got the habit, the habit in Arabic means to go.
2565440	2566880	But the hub also means gold.
2567920	2569600	The hubbun means rot.
2569600	2574000	So, so, but why does the hub and the hub have the same spelling?
2574000	2577040	It's actually because the Arab philosophy is gold doesn't stay with you.
2578320	2582480	It goes, somebody gonna kill you or you're gonna die and somebody else gonna take it.
2582480	2583280	You can't keep it.
2583840	2584480	It's gonna go.
2585200	2589920	Interestingly, fadbha in Arabic, fadbha means to break apart and leave.
2590960	2591360	Fadbha.
2591920	2594000	And fadbha is silver.
2594880	2596080	Similar idea.
2596080	2599200	You can have the silver, but it's gonna break apart and leave.
2599200	2600560	You're not gonna keep the wealth.
2600560	2601280	It's gonna go.
2601280	2601600	Okay.
2601600	2604240	So fadbha and fadbha, zahaba and zahab, right?
2604240	2611120	I read to Nas, I saw people, they go, ilaman ndahu zahabu, they go towards someone who has gold.
2611680	2614160	They do zahab to someone who has zahab.
2619200	2622000	And whoever doesn't have zahab, well, people zahab from him.
2627040	2632160	I see that people break off and run ilaman ndahu fidda.
2632160	2634160	They go towards someone who has silver.
2636480	2638080	And someone who doesn't have fidda.
2638640	2641520	Fa'an hunnasumun fadda and people then break away from him.
2641520	2643200	You don't have many people break away from you.
2643200	2649440	It's like, you know, some of you guys, you live in, you know, Europe and then you go back home
2649440	2655200	for vacation or a wedding or aqiqa or your mom's forcing you to marry someone, whatever,
2655760	2656960	whatever your situation is.
2658000	2664080	But when you go back, everybody looks at you like, you just came from, you just, you were,
2664080	2668080	you had climbed up one of the trees of Jannah and you came and you probably have some leaves
2668080	2669040	of Jannah in your pocket.
2670240	2672880	So they come to you like, so you got a lot of money, right?
2674640	2679120	They're always like, let's hang out with them or they're going to take us to the expensive
2679120	2683920	restaurant. I wonder what, and when you're unpacking your suitcase to take out your smelly clothes,
2683920	2687680	they think that you have a treasure chest of giveaways for the village.
2689600	2693440	So they come towards you because you come from the land of the hub and fidda.
2694320	2699040	Right? And then if you decide you're going to move back and you're not, you know,
2699680	2702880	you're not going to live in Germany or Canada or Australia or the U.S.
2702880	2707120	or you're just, then people are like, no, I'm going to, I'm going to zap from you because
2707120	2712560	you're no longer zap bro. Then your zap days are over. The golden days are gone.
2714480	2721040	Right? So anyway, the, but the idea is that, you know, trade and money is in fact attractive.
2721040	2724800	Now let's get to the actual, the heart of the matter. I've read the narration to you,
2724800	2728240	but the main lessons I want to discuss with you in regards to this ayah.
2730080	2734000	Assalamu alaikum everyone. There are almost 50,000 students around the world
2734000	2738400	that are interested on top of the students we have in studying the Quran and its meanings
2738400	2742400	and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends. And they need sponsorships,
2742400	2746480	which is not very expensive. So if you can help sponsor students on Bayanah TV,
2746480	2750400	please do so and visit our sponsorship page. I appreciate it so much and pray that Allah gives
2750400	2754240	our mission success and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran and the beauty of it,
2754240	2755040	the world over.
