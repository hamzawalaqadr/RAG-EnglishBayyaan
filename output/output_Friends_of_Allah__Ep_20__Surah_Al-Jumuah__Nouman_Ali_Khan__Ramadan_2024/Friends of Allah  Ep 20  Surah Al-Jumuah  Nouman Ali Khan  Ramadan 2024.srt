1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Our religion, is it a transaction with Allah?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
No, but you know what you find some people doing?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I used to pray, I fasted, I even didn't even drink any Haram, I didn't eat any Haram,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and I only asked Allah for one thing, and I kept making dua and I kept making dua,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and Allah didn't give it to me. Why should I pray?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, and that's actually also a big part of hikmah, isn't it?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hikmah means which medicine is needed at which time, right?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Because some people, their entire religion is just negative,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and other people, so it's all fear, and for other people their entire religion is all positive.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And both of these are dangerous, both of these are dangerous, too much sweet, you get diabetes.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And too much negativity, you get autoimmune diseases, you get all other problems.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So this is a remarkable balance Allah has struck between those two, and that's our life,

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
it's always between these two, good times and hard times, good times and hard times,

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that's just what it's going to be, that's just this slide.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now let's look at the word awliya, awliyaullah, awliya ulinda actually, it's really cool.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In the Quran, awliya by the way from wadiya, let me explain the word first,

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the animal like the horse, the Arabs like to put a saddle on top,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
if you've seen western films, as taqfidullah, because you're the slummit, so you don't watch movies,

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but if you're in western movies, the cowboys got a saddle, and that's on the saddle, right?

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But the saddle, because you're sitting on it, you're putting weight on it,

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
it hurts the skin of the horse, right?

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Because a long time it gets a blister, like you guys if you ever go to al-Murah or something,

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and you buy the cheapest slippers you can, because you know they're going to disappear into the akhada,

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
by the time you come out, right?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But those slippers, you know how they give you that blister on your skin after a while,

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
it's just better off barefoot, you know?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So the animal also gets a blister, because the thing is touching on it all the time,

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
so what the Arabs used to do is they used to put like a cushion, a little bit,

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and then put the saddle on top, so its skin does not become irritated, right?

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But then it's, and they wouldn't take the saddle off, and the saddle is sitting there for months and months and months,

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and then they take the saddle off, and that pillow is so embossed on the skin of the horse,

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that they have to peel it off like a sticker too, right?

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's just, it's really stuck on there, right?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's actually called a waliya, because it gets really stuck on there.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
A waliya is a friend that's really stuck to you.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's actually a waliya.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're stuck to them, they are, stuck to you.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And they're with you no matter what, a strong relationship, waliya ful'anan,

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
to come after or be right immediately next to someone is actually waliya.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
In modern Arabic they say atadi is the next, it's from the same origin actually.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Atadi, okay? It's from Wa'u Dhamman, yeah.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So, from there, another meaning of wala is actually to command something,

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
like the one who has authority over something, okay?

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now, it has opposite meanings, the one who turned away from something,

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the one who turned towards something, right?

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now, what does all of this mean?

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The kind of friend, because Arabic has lots of words for friends,

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but the kind of friend that is always stuck to you, always with you, never leaves your side.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That would be your waliya, that would be your waliya.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And if you have the assumption that Allah will be on your side no matter what,

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
that would be awliya, awliya linda.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now, it is the Quran, if you know a little bit of Arabic,

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
awliya could be a mudaaf, and the word Allah could be the mudaaf,

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
like,

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
alla inna awliya allahi la hawfun alehim wala umyahzanun,

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
which means the close friends of Allah.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The close friends of, I'm using the word of Allah.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But this one is, if you think you are friends to Allah, not of,

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
it's awliya li Allah, there's a laam in between.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The laam creates a grammar and rhetoric, it creates a distance, it's ibad,

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which means in this ayah Allah did not put them so close, even in that claim.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
They could have been closer with what words awliya Allah?

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But Allah said awliya linda, which may also actually be a commentary on,

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you're not really sure this is the case, and you don't really act too close to Allah.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, I mean, even if you made that claim, it's kind of iffy, so it's awliya linda.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then you believe this to be as opposed to all other people.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is the key to the ayah, mendud innaas.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There are two qualifications that are going to come, this is the first of them, mendud innaas.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What does this mean? It means if you think Allah will be on your side,

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
no matter what, because you are the chosen people, and everybody else is supposed to go to hell,

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
everybody else doesn't deserve that special place that you deserve with Allah,

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
then if that is in fact the case, that means that no matter what, you are guaranteed jannah.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's what that means, you're guaranteed heaven, there's no way around it.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And if you're guaranteed heaven, by the way, is the Muslim guaranteed heaven?

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No, no, we have to beg Allah, and we even judgment they were begging Allah,

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Rabbana tbimlana nurana, Allah complete our light.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're walking towards it now, we still don't have a guarantee.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Even the people who have the book in their right hand are begging Allah,

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
let this walk complete, please, ya Allah.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The battery should not die on the light that you gave me,

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
it starts flickering and it goes on, that would be a problem.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let the light stay on until we get there,

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
atmimlana nurana wa sildanan, forgive us, right?

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We don't live with that guarantee.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
By the way, Christians sometimes have conversations with fun Christians, sometimes it goes,

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you know, you should accept Jesus as the Lord and Savior,

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
because you're guaranteed heaven, ya'll don't have a guarantee, do you?

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like, no we don't, neither do you.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes, we do.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I was like, you do?

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The one time one pastor told me, we have a guarantee for heaven.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I was like, okay.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If I accept this, I'm thinking, when this conversation is over,

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I've always imagined what it would be like to rob a bank.

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I want to do it.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I was like, why would you do that?

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was like, because I'm going to go to heaven anyway.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's stopping me from doing it?

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, but if you had Jesus in your heart, you wouldn't do it.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was like, then what did he pay for?

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I thought he paid for my sins.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If I'm not going to sin, then he paid for nothing.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We should have paid for something.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So let me go do it.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, you see how it starts falling apart?

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then, on this side, if in fact, if it is the case that you are truly the friends of Allah

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and you have a guarantee of heaven, then let me just tell you,

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
let's not the Islamic view that I just presented.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's take the other view.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The other view would be, imagine if the Muslim was told,

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
no matter what you do, Allah is with you, you will be given what?

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Jannah.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Then what do we know about Jannah?

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Is it better in this world or no?

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In this world, poor guy, he has to go to college,

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
he has to fail a test, he has to take a review,

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
he has to pay the tuition, he has to convince his parents,

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I want to get married, I want to get married.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They don't let him get married.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He finally likes a girl and he proposes and then she says no.

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And then, there's so much he's got to go through, poor guy.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And then eventually he gets married and he's like,

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
this is not going to be the most amazing thing ever because I'm married.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then he finds out what marriage is.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And then, you know, then he's changing diapers in no time and

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
they don't smell that good.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know, every joy comes with pain in this life, doesn't it?

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Getting a new job is joy.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But after a couple of days on the job, getting a nice car.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Awesome.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Getting stuck in traffic.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You know, first time people sit on a plane,

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
like if you get kids on a plane.

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Six hours later on the same flight.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Where are we landing?

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you have the guarantee of Jadna, you're not going to get old.

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're not going to get sick.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're going to have the best housing, the best spouse, no problems.

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What are you doing here?

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Gold role?

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Because there's no point being here if you have so much better waiting for you.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't have to deal with war and famine and disease and sickness and old age.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There's nothing. Go.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know what this, Allah is not telling them to wish for death.

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Allah is saying if you actually believed what you believed, you would be.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You understand the point here?

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Do we believe this?

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And because we don't believe this, we don't wish for what?

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We wish for a good death.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We don't wish for death.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We wish for A. Good.

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And we don't know when that is.

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So we don't wish for it because we're not sure if we're ready for it yet.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We just, yeah, Allah just give us a good death.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Give us death among good people.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Give us death while we're in a state of Islam.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Give us death when we're in a state of Taqwa.

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This is our doves.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
A completely different worldview.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And Allah is saying anybody who believes that they are saved in some way,

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
they should be wishing like this.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Now, it's the Mandun in us is also really interesting because right before this,

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
when the previous section that we were discussing, what did Allah tell us?

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
These Umayyin are coming into the final this religion of God.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And then the Umayyin invitation is being opened to every nation on earth.

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All the people that weren't going into Jannah now have a chance to be purified.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And you're like, no, they're not going to go to Jannah.

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Where the hell are they going to go to Jannah?

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, then go.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Put them a down vote.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Go ahead.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In Qutul Saad-i-Qeen.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
These are some other ayat.

174
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Actually, I won't go through them because that level take too long for you guys.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But for your own homework, you should kind of look at places in the Quran where the word wadi is used.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Just as an analysis, like what is the word, the relationship between me and Allah of wadi?

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What does it look like?

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
These are a couple of ayat that I selected like Allah,

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
wa li-latina, aamanu yusriju'un min al-lumati lannu.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Allah is the protective friend of those who believe.

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He pulls them out of darknesses and brings them into light.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
By the way, the second ayat of this Surah,

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
yaddu alayhim ayatihi wa yuzakkihim wa yu'alimu al-kitab wa al-hikmah, you know what that is?

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Allah pulling people out of darkness into light, which means Allah is being their wadi.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Because Allah says in Surat Al-Baqarah, Allah as a wadi, pulls people out of darkness into light.

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's pahadallah.

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's what wadi actually does.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's what the wadi, if you're truly the awliya' of Allah,

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
then you're journeying from darkness towards light.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's what you're doing.

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And every day you're identifying some other kind of darkness

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and you're making another step and another step and another step and another step.

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's when you're awliya' of Allah.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
By the way, the term awliya' of Allah,

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm going to say something that's going to sound controversial to you guys,

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
but it's okay, I'm leaving in a few days.

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We have this concept in some of our Islamic traditions

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
where some people are considered the awliya' of Allah.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And even nowadays there are some traditions in which people say,

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I have a wadi of Allah in my neighborhood.

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I have a wadi of Allah in our village.

202
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We have a wadi.

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Right?

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
These are the...

205
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And what is a common threat among...

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's in different cultures, by the way.

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's in South Asia, it's in Southeast Asia, it's in different places.

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Turkey, other places, right?

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And these awliya' of Allah, they are deeply connected with Allah like you cannot be.

210
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What they all have in common is they're spiritually connected to Allah.

211
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're not.

212
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And they can help you get closer to Allah because they're already...

213
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They already graduated from the school of distance.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They're in the school of closeness to Allah.

215
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're not.

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And they are the ones that are going to elevate you.

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Right?

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
When you...

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
When someone declares that they are closer to Allah,

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
doesn't that sound like disassumption?

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Doesn't that sound like...

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Like, I can't imagine as a student that I'm not like that.

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
As a student of the Quran, at any point in my life,

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I can say about myself, I am a what?

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I would say, I pray that Allah considers me...

226
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Allah is my wadi.

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And it would be an honor that Allah would declare me His wadi.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Actually, because who decides if I'm a wadi to Allah,

229
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
it's more Allah's decision than mine.

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Right?

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Allah is the best.

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Allah is the wadi.

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because it would be very self-righteous of me to declare myself a wadi of Allah.

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And the thing is that every one of us has ups and downs.

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We're human, right?

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We have ups and downs.

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Do you think at some point you will become so good that you no longer have ups and downs?

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Is that possible for you?

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But why do you think it's possible for someone else?

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why would you think that somebody has reached a certain status?

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
They become the Pope now?

242
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They can't come down.

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They've already reached the level of angels and they can't dip from that.

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And therefore, all of their prayers are answered.

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We can do all the good deeds in the world and we can mess it up.

246
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And we can be drowning in sin and we can make doba and be raised.

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Allah increases anybody in ranks.

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And you know,

249
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So this mentality that Allah is describing about,

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
we've exhibited some of these behaviors.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And you know what?

252
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Wherever you find this kind of behavior, you find a lot of problems too.

253
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You find a lot of problems.

254
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This mentality creates problems in that society.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It creates cults.

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It creates people worship.

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It creates, it's a new kind of idol worship.

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You know, and these people can't be wrong because they represent the will of Allah Himself.

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's exactly what the Pope says.

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What these other religions say.

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The rabbinical tradition believed that the rabbis are so close to God

262
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
that when they give a fatwa, it actually represents the will of God Himself.

263
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's why the Talmud kept any additions made to the Talmud is considered sacred.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's actually considered part of the word of God.

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Their opinion is considered part of the word of God.

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You know?

267
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And this is the kind of thing that the Quran came to eliminate.

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You know, one of my friends said this really, he was a student of history

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and he said something really cool.

270
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He said religions before Islam, they were superstitious.

271
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
They had people that you had to go through to connect to God.

272
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Intermediaries, you had to go through them.

273
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And religions were all about granting people wishes.

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So why did people go to a religion?

275
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Because they want to get married.

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Why do people go to a religion?

277
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Because they want more money.

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Or they want to get out of debt.

279
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Or they want to solve a problem.

280
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Or they want to heal a child.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Or have a child.

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Or whatever. Wishes.

283
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So people go to a religion for these things.

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And Islam came and reconstructed, restored.

285
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The purpose of true religion is not these things.

286
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You don't have to go through anybody because you are a slave of Allah directly.

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The messenger, sallallahu alaihi wasalam, will teach you how to connect to Allah yourself.

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The messenger will give you the word of Allah that you must engage with directly.

289
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Sallallahu alaihi wasalam.

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
A direct bond between the slave and Allah.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And all of us together trying to bond with Allah, subhanAllah, this communal.

292
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And by the way, does that mean you shouldn't be learning from someone or have a role model?

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes, but a father should have been the role model to his children.

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And the grandfather should have been the role model to the entire family.

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Among your friends, the more knowledgeable become a role model in learning and in behavior.

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It wasn't supposed to be some special class of people that are designated holy people.

297
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Because this holy class was actually something that every other religion used to have.

298
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But Islam came and everybody became what?

299
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Equal.

300
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Though the final speech of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasalam, nobody is better than anybody except by what designation?

301
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Takwa and Takwa lies in the heart and you can't see it.

302
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't see your Takwa, you can't see mine. It's invisible.

303
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What did we do? We created Takwa uniforms.

304
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Okay, but if you dress the certain way, you look as if there is Takwa guy walking around.

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
When Takwa man walks into the restaurant, everybody comes out.

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Let me go get him to make the du'as for me.

307
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Because his du'as get accepted.

308
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You know, there's Takwa ladies too.

309
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
When they walk into a party, nobody has fun anymore.

310
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You know who they are.

311
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You know, they have a certain walk.

312
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They have a certain look.

313
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Haas, Tal Fiddle.

314
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Speak of it.

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Everybody is eating chicken.

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There was a stop for that.

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That kind of istighfar needs a stighfar.

318
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Honestly, you know, this demonstration of spirituality, come on.

319
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is, these kinds of aiyat, you know what they do?

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They shatter the idea of posturing and presenting yourself as sacred?

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, that's not actually the case.

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's actually what the aiyat do.

323
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But I'm a no-l note in kundub saddikh.

324
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Go ahead.

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What are you doing in this world then?

326
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You know, if you wish for that, the word temenni.

327
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I didn't know this.

328
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I learned this today.

329
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I was today years old when I learned this.

330
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The word temenni, which means wish, I translated as wish,

331
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
actually comes from many, which means sperm.

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I was like, what is sperm and wish?

333
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What do they have to do with each other?

334
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The erids were so creative.

335
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Like, I read this in Imam Rahman, but that's fahadi.

336
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's really cool.

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm just one piece of it I'm sharing with you.

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
First, the erids were fascinated that this fluid turns into a full-on human being.

339
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So they thought this thing, this liquid, does the impossible.

340
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So they thought of the birth of a child as something impossible that happens.

341
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So they associated many with that which can't possibly happen.

342
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And from it, I'll read it.

343
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.

344
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you

345
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com and help other sign up,

346
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
even sponsor students for bayinatv.com so we can create worldwide communities of students

347
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and are insha'Allah ta'ala spreading that in their own circles.

349
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Thanks so much.

350
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And the word temenni also meant something that's very limited

351
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
because they think this little drop and an entire baby, you know,

352
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
something very limited that's producing something massive.

353
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Because we are able to identify something in the same way as the picture.

354
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And that could be about thinking and thinking.

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Meaning they're just using some imagination.

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
How could this happen?

357
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
From this limited thing, this massive human being.

358
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And it could be about a vision and a building on the inside.

359
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But when he was more on thinking, he became a liar for your own good.

360
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So they used to actually think temenni is always believing something impossible.

361
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Like something it became associated with something impossible.

362
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What does that mean?

363
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And imagining something that could possibly be true.

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And that's why he said,

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm going to be a liar.

366
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And that's why I'm going to be a liar.

367
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Unlike the translation.

368
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So the word temenni started getting used for things that are impossible.

369
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Like they thought the birth of a child is just some impossible mysterious thing.

370
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It can't be this.

371
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
There's got to be something else.

372
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
How could this happen?

373
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So the word temenni became wishing for impossible things.

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Having what you can call delusional wishes.

375
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Delusional wishes would be called temenni.

376
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And amani, another word in the Quran.

377
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Unless it's laisa bi alani yukum,

378
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
the religion is not based on your delusional thinking.

379
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Your wishes.

380
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The religion is not about your wishes.

381
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Amlilin sa'adim ataman na Quranahs.

382
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The human being just get whatever he delusional wishes for.

383
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're just going to get whatever you wish for.

384
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That's what you think?

385
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And I said this in my delus on previous surahs.

386
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But I'll just briefly mention this to you.

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Temenni as a concept.

388
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Other religions, like I told you,

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
people would go up 10,000 steps on a mountain

390
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
to stand in front of a statue to say,

391
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
please make her fall in love with me.

392
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Right?

393
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
They go up there not to become spiritually elevated or whatever.

394
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
They go up there for some wish that they need to get answered.

395
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You understand?

396
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The money to be blessed.

397
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The child to be blessed.

398
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The marriage to happen.

399
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The problem to be solved.

400
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This was all religion.

401
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It was a transaction between them and the gods.

402
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I present to you this, you know, bowl of milk and this Kit Kat.

403
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Please allow me to pass the exam.

404
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I will give you this.

405
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
These gods will give me something.

406
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The Vikings and these guys,

407
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
they would sacrifice somebody so that their gods,

408
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Odin or whoever would help them in victory against the enemy.

409
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Because the gods won't help if we don't give them something.

410
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You got to give them something, then they'll give you something.

411
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's a transaction.

412
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a transaction with the gods.

413
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Right?

414
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Our religion, is it a transaction with Allah?

415
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
No.

416
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But you know what you find some people doing?

417
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I used to pray.

418
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I fasted.

419
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I even didn't even drink any Haram.

420
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I didn't eat any Haram.

421
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And I only asked Allah for one thing.

422
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And I kept making dua and I kept making dua

423
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and Allah didn't give it to me.

424
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Why should I pray?

425
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I think you should try a different religion

426
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
where you can go up 10,000 steps

427
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and place your order after making your payment.

428
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Because in your mind, prayer and fasting

429
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and abiding by Sharia was your form of what?

430
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Payment.

431
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And now that you made the payment,

432
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
you're expecting compensation.

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You must not have understood what this religion is.

434
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You may have thought this was some kind of a transaction.

435
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's not a transaction.

436
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
This religion gives you purpose.

437
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And another religion you might say,

438
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
follow this religion,

439
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
we'll get you what you want.

440
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Like I heard Joel Stien say all the time.

441
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Joel Stien, I've mentioned this a lot

442
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
because I've learned so much from that experience.

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
When I went to his special in Christmas,

444
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I went to his Christmas special at the American Airlines Theater.

445
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's what I do on Christmas.

446
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I go to a big Christian thing.

447
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I've done it once.

448
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I think I'll do it again though. It's fun.

449
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I got a ticket. I'm sitting in the back

450
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and he's like,

451
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
what are these Christians going to talk about on Christmas?

452
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And he's one of the biggest preachers in America, right?

453
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
For a while.

454
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And he goes up, this year,

455
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
your divorce is going to be finished.

456
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The lawyers, they're not going to come after you no more.

457
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This year, you're going to get your promotion.

458
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
This year, that cancer, it's going to be gone.

459
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And there's like 20,000 people sitting in the city,

460
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and I'm like, yes, yes it is.

461
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes it is.

462
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yup, yup.

463
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
He's giving them whatever they have.

464
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Taman Nio, Amani, Amani, Amani.

465
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And you just, Jesus is going to take care of all your problems.

466
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And people are like, yes he is.

467
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yes he is.

468
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And what do we do?

469
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Brother, when's the 27th night of Ramadan?

470
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
When's the 27th night?

471
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Why you want to know about the 27th night?

472
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Oh, just I just have to make Duhah.

473
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I have to recite a lot.

474
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Why are you reciting so much Quran?

475
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Why are you reciting making so much?

476
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Because it's the 27th that you want rewards.

477
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You want to let it give you guidance.

478
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You want to let it give you purpose in life.

479
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You want to let it forgive your sins.

480
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Nah, nah, nah.

481
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This Defaat is cool.

482
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But I actually have some really important things I want to ask about.

483
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Like Abdu'l-Karim's family hasn't called back with the proposal.

484
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What did we do with our religion?

485
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Our religion gave us higher purpose.

486
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But humanity really gets stuck in worldly things.

487
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So what we did is we re-engineered our religion back towards what other religions do with theirs.

488
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Slowly but surely we redirected it.

489
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And you know the only way that redirection is possible?

490
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Distance from the Quran.

491
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Should you ask for things from Allah?

492
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah, I know some of you were like, are you saying I can't make Duhah for anything anymore?

493
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Allah said,

494
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
رَبَلَا عَاتِنَ فِيْدُنْيَا حَسَرَ وَفِنَا خِرَتِيْ

495
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Of course you should make Duhah.

496
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But you know what?

497
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
When wanting things of this world becomes your fundamental relationship with Allah.

498
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Your fundamental, and I explained this with one analogy, please keep this analogy with you.

499
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It will help.

500
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Imagine you're going from here, you're driving from here to Hamburg.

501
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Road trip.

502
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
When you're driving from here to Hamburg, are you going to stop for gas or no?

503
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You're going to have to.

504
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Except for fuel, there's a restroom, eat some food.

505
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Isn't it?

506
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Now imagine you stop at a restroom and you're like, this place is amazing.

507
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I've never seen a gas station this nice.

508
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And you just live in the gas station.

509
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They sh**.

510
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Bro, the gas station is nice.

511
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I know they make really good french fries.

512
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I get it.

513
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You really like the scenery.

514
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But this was a stop.

515
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You can enjoy the stop.

516
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But then what must you do?

517
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Move on.

518
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And then you'll get hungry again.

519
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You'll stop again.

520
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And you'll move.

521
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And you'll refuel.

522
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And you'll move again.

523
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Experiences in this life are like what?

524
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The gas station.

525
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The destination is something bigger and greater.

526
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What happens to us?

527
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
There's one experience in our life.

528
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
One thing we want, like the gas station, we get where?

529
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is what I want.

530
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
This is my new goal.

531
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
No, no, you have something bigger.

532
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No, no, no, but this though.

533
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
This though.

534
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Once I have this, then I can...

535
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You know, we get distracted on the way.

536
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
There's a road we're on.

537
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And in that road, some things will come to us.

538
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Some things will be taken away from us.

539
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
People will come in our life.

540
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
People will go from our lives.

541
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Opportunities will come.

542
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Opportunities will go.

543
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Money will come.

544
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Money will go.

545
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Health will come. Health will go.

546
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
There will be ups and downs in this life.

547
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But none of those things are objective.

548
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
They are experiences.

549
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We will be grateful for the beautiful experiences.

550
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
We will be patient and still grateful for the tough experiences.

551
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
We'll keep moving forward.

552
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But you can't get stuck in a gas station, you know?

553
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And that's part of the lesson to learn here.

554
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And then finally in Quntum Saad-i-Qinala,

555
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and with that, Chawla, I'll give you your break,

556
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
is if in fact you're telling the truth,

557
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the word truth, I want you to understand something about it.

558
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Siddhq, means truth.

559
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But actually, you know a spear, right?

560
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Belonging, throw, kill, thingy.

561
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If the middle of the spear is weak,

562
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
then it can be easily broken.

563
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But when the middle of the spear is thick and unbreakable,

564
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
that kind of spear is actually called ruhun siddhq.

565
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
An unbreakable, strong spear.

566
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
A man who cannot be beaten on the battlefield,

567
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
unbreakable man is rajulun siddhq.

568
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And assault and attack on the enemy,

569
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
which could not be defended against,

570
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
is called hamlatun siddhq.

571
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
From it, you get the strongest kind of friend

572
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
who doesn't break the bonds of friendship.

573
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The most true kind of friend.

574
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
When things are tough, they're your friend.

575
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
When things are easy, they're your friend.

576
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
They're not an opportunist friend.

577
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Opportunist friend, that kind of friend is a siddhq.

578
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
From the same word, siddhq.

579
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Siddhq truth actually means something strong that doesn't break.

580
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The idea of truth in Arabic is actually strength.

581
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And you might not know this, but kehrib, which is lie,

582
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
actually comes from an animal that when it walks,

583
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
it stops and it looks back to see if something's coming for it.

584
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Then it walks and it yataraddad fil mashih.

585
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It hesitates in its movement and it's actually weak.

586
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's weak and the opposite of strong.

587
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And it's also interesting that kehrib has to do with defense

588
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and siddhq has to do with offense.

589
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
By the etymology of these words,

590
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
but Allah says in Qutum Saadikim,

591
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He's saying, read easy translation if you're truthful,

592
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
but behind these words is, if you stand on firm ground.

593
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
If what you believe is actually strong and solid,

594
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
it's based on something that never shakes.

595
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And in it, Allah is making an invitation.

596
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
People that will hold on to this faith have to have firm, solid base.

597
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Why am I a believer? Why am I a Muslim?

598
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Why do I believe this to be the word of God?

599
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
How? That takes us back to yatlu aleyhi mayatihi wa mizakim.

600
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Those two, they actually make you clear about why you're a believer.

601
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
They make you firm on why must you hold on to this book.

602
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
They make you firm on that.

603
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We've become obsessed with the book.

604
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Actually, not even the hikmah. We've obsessed with the book.

605
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We just say, oh, Muslims are doing this.

606
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
There's corruption here. Young youth are doing this.

607
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
They're eating haram. They're earning haram.

608
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
They're dressing haram. They're doing haram haram haram.

609
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Actually, violation of kitab here, violation of kitab here, violation of kitab here.

610
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Nobody stops to ask the question, why is this 18-year-old doing drugs?

611
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Why is this 17-year-old drinking?

612
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Would you ask him, do you believe in the Quran?

613
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I guess. Why do you believe in my parents are Muslim?

614
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I guess I believe. Is that strong?

615
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Does that sound like a spear that doesn't break?

616
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
No.

617
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And then if you watch an inspirational video,

618
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you watch like, you know, people sometimes take my clips.

619
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I don't know why they take my clips. My clips are depressing, but, you know,

620
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
other people, you watch like a Mufti Mank video.

621
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And the money you've done just went up.

622
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So good.

623
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm so Muslim right now.

624
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm going to share this with everyone.

625
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I want to make this my WhatsApp story.

626
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Right?

627
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Your iman is emotional. You hear something inspirational?

628
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Goes up.

629
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Then what happens?

630
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You all know what happens next?

631
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Way down.

632
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Then you're depressed.

633
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And then you watch something emotional.

634
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Then down here again.

635
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You know what that means?

636
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's based on which your faith sits.

637
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Depends on your mood.

638
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Depends.

639
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And is your mood something stable?

640
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Is my mood something stable?

641
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
My iman cannot be based on something emotional.

642
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
My iman has to be based on something much more solid than emotions,

643
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
because emotions are always up and down.

644
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
The iman has to be based on something that I'm absolutely clearly convinced of

645
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
to be the truth.

646
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm intellectually cleansed, emotionally cleansed.

647
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And if it's sitting on that intellectual basis,

648
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
that this is in fact al-haq,

649
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
then my emotions will go up and down, sure,

650
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
but they won't go below my convictions.

651
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm never going to get to a point where I'm okay with alcohol now,

652
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
or I'm okay with stealing now.

653
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
No, no, no.

654
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'll feel a lesser iman sometimes,

655
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
but there's a minimum threshold,

656
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and the iman is so solid, it doesn't let me go below that.

657
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And if my iman is easily going below that,

658
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
it's because that base hasn't been built.

659
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And that's the base that the Quran builds.

660
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That's where yatlu a'layhi ma'ayatihi wa yuzakhi'in comes from.

661
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And I've been taking a super long time for this session,

662
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
but as we come to this,

663
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
one thing I forgot to mention yesterday, and I should have mentioned it,

664
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Allah says about these people in the previous ayah,

665
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
that they lost their relationship with their book.

666
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Basically, it was a non-relationship.

667
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
They have a book like Donkeys Carrying a Load, right?

668
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This ayah is strategically right after Allah mentioned

669
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
the four-step process from the Prophet's license.

670
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You know why that's important?

671
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That's important because if we ever abandon that four-step process,

672
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
we will end up in this exact situation.

673
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That actually, that four-step process,

674
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
starting with yatlu a'layhi ma'ayatihi wa yuzakhi'in,

675
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
then you'll learn the book and the book.

676
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
If we leave that four-step process,

677
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
we will end up in this exact place,

678
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Kamafal il-Himari Yahmi al-Wasfara.

679
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
May Allah protect us from that.

680
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So let's take your break, inshallah. Enjoy a good 10 minutes.

681
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Assalamu alaikum everyone.

682
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
There are almost 50,000 students around the world

683
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
that are interested on top of the students we have

684
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
in studying the Quran and its meanings

685
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.

686
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive.

687
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV,

688
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
please do so and visit our sponsorship page.

689
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I appreciate it so much.

690
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And pray that Allah gives our mission success

691
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran

692
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and the beauty of it the world over.
