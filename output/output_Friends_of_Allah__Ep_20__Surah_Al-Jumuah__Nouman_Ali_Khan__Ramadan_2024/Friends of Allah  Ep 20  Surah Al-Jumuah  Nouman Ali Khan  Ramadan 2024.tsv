0	4000	Our religion, is it a transaction with Allah?
4000	7000	No, but you know what you find some people doing?
7000	13000	I used to pray, I fasted, I even didn't even drink any Haram, I didn't eat any Haram,
13000	18000	and I only asked Allah for one thing, and I kept making dua and I kept making dua,
18000	22000	and Allah didn't give it to me. Why should I pray?
23000	30000	You know, and that's actually also a big part of hikmah, isn't it?
30000	35000	Hikmah means which medicine is needed at which time, right?
35000	39000	Because some people, their entire religion is just negative,
39000	45000	and other people, so it's all fear, and for other people their entire religion is all positive.
45000	51000	And both of these are dangerous, both of these are dangerous, too much sweet, you get diabetes.
52000	57000	And too much negativity, you get autoimmune diseases, you get all other problems.
57000	62000	So this is a remarkable balance Allah has struck between those two, and that's our life,
62000	66000	it's always between these two, good times and hard times, good times and hard times,
66000	68000	that's just what it's going to be, that's just this slide.
68000	74000	Now let's look at the word awliya, awliyaullah, awliya ulinda actually, it's really cool.
74000	79000	In the Quran, awliya by the way from wadiya, let me explain the word first,
80000	84000	the animal like the horse, the Arabs like to put a saddle on top,
84000	88000	if you've seen western films, as taqfidullah, because you're the slummit, so you don't watch movies,
88000	93000	but if you're in western movies, the cowboys got a saddle, and that's on the saddle, right?
93000	97000	But the saddle, because you're sitting on it, you're putting weight on it,
97000	101000	it hurts the skin of the horse, right?
101000	105000	Because a long time it gets a blister, like you guys if you ever go to al-Murah or something,
105000	109000	and you buy the cheapest slippers you can, because you know they're going to disappear into the akhada,
109000	112000	by the time you come out, right?
112000	117000	But those slippers, you know how they give you that blister on your skin after a while,
117000	120000	it's just better off barefoot, you know?
120000	124000	So the animal also gets a blister, because the thing is touching on it all the time,
124000	129000	so what the Arabs used to do is they used to put like a cushion, a little bit,
129000	135000	and then put the saddle on top, so its skin does not become irritated, right?
135000	140000	But then it's, and they wouldn't take the saddle off, and the saddle is sitting there for months and months and months,
140000	145000	and then they take the saddle off, and that pillow is so embossed on the skin of the horse,
145000	148000	that they have to peel it off like a sticker too, right?
148000	150000	It's just, it's really stuck on there, right?
150000	155000	That's actually called a waliya, because it gets really stuck on there.
155000	160000	A waliya is a friend that's really stuck to you.
160000	162000	That's actually a waliya.
162000	166000	You're stuck to them, they are, stuck to you.
166000	170000	And they're with you no matter what, a strong relationship, waliya ful'anan,
170000	174000	to come after or be right immediately next to someone is actually waliya.
174000	178000	In modern Arabic they say atadi is the next, it's from the same origin actually.
178000	182000	Atadi, okay? It's from Wa'u Dhamman, yeah.
182000	187000	So, from there, another meaning of wala is actually to command something,
187000	191000	like the one who has authority over something, okay?
191000	195000	Now, it has opposite meanings, the one who turned away from something,
195000	197000	the one who turned towards something, right?
197000	199000	Now, what does all of this mean?
199000	203000	The kind of friend, because Arabic has lots of words for friends,
203000	208000	but the kind of friend that is always stuck to you, always with you, never leaves your side.
208000	211000	That would be your waliya, that would be your waliya.
211000	218000	And if you have the assumption that Allah will be on your side no matter what,
218000	221000	that would be awliya, awliya linda.
221000	224000	Now, it is the Quran, if you know a little bit of Arabic,
224000	227000	awliya could be a mudaaf, and the word Allah could be the mudaaf,
227000	228000	like,
228000	233000	alla inna awliya allahi la hawfun alehim wala umyahzanun,
233000	237000	which means the close friends of Allah.
237000	240000	The close friends of, I'm using the word of Allah.
240000	246000	But this one is, if you think you are friends to Allah, not of,
246000	250000	it's awliya li Allah, there's a laam in between.
250000	256000	The laam creates a grammar and rhetoric, it creates a distance, it's ibad,
256000	261000	which means in this ayah Allah did not put them so close, even in that claim.
261000	265000	They could have been closer with what words awliya Allah?
265000	271000	But Allah said awliya linda, which may also actually be a commentary on,
271000	276000	you're not really sure this is the case, and you don't really act too close to Allah.
276000	283000	So, I mean, even if you made that claim, it's kind of iffy, so it's awliya linda.
283000	286000	And then you believe this to be as opposed to all other people.
286000	289000	This is the key to the ayah, mendud innaas.
289000	293000	There are two qualifications that are going to come, this is the first of them, mendud innaas.
293000	297000	What does this mean? It means if you think Allah will be on your side,
297000	302000	no matter what, because you are the chosen people, and everybody else is supposed to go to hell,
302000	307000	everybody else doesn't deserve that special place that you deserve with Allah,
307000	316000	then if that is in fact the case, that means that no matter what, you are guaranteed jannah.
316000	320000	That's what that means, you're guaranteed heaven, there's no way around it.
320000	325000	And if you're guaranteed heaven, by the way, is the Muslim guaranteed heaven?
325000	330000	No, no, we have to beg Allah, and we even judgment they were begging Allah,
330000	333000	Rabbana tbimlana nurana, Allah complete our light.
333000	336000	We're walking towards it now, we still don't have a guarantee.
336000	339000	Even the people who have the book in their right hand are begging Allah,
339000	342000	let this walk complete, please, ya Allah.
342000	345000	The battery should not die on the light that you gave me,
345000	348000	it starts flickering and it goes on, that would be a problem.
348000	350000	Let the light stay on until we get there,
350000	353000	atmimlana nurana wa sildanan, forgive us, right?
353000	355000	We don't live with that guarantee.
355000	359000	By the way, Christians sometimes have conversations with fun Christians, sometimes it goes,
359000	362000	you know, you should accept Jesus as the Lord and Savior,
362000	368000	because you're guaranteed heaven, ya'll don't have a guarantee, do you?
368000	371000	Like, no we don't, neither do you.
371000	373000	Yes, we do.
373000	374000	I was like, you do?
374000	377000	The one time one pastor told me, we have a guarantee for heaven.
377000	379000	I was like, okay.
379000	383000	If I accept this, I'm thinking, when this conversation is over,
383000	386000	I've always imagined what it would be like to rob a bank.
386000	388000	I want to do it.
388000	390000	I was like, why would you do that?
390000	392000	I was like, because I'm going to go to heaven anyway.
392000	395000	What's stopping me from doing it?
395000	398000	No, but if you had Jesus in your heart, you wouldn't do it.
398000	401000	I was like, then what did he pay for?
401000	404000	I thought he paid for my sins.
404000	408000	If I'm not going to sin, then he paid for nothing.
408000	412000	We should have paid for something.
412000	415000	So let me go do it.
415000	419000	So, you see how it starts falling apart?
419000	425000	Then, on this side, if in fact, if it is the case that you are truly the friends of Allah
425000	429000	and you have a guarantee of heaven, then let me just tell you,
429000	432000	let's not the Islamic view that I just presented.
432000	434000	Let's take the other view.
434000	437000	The other view would be, imagine if the Muslim was told,
437000	441000	no matter what you do, Allah is with you, you will be given what?
441000	442000	Jannah.
442000	443000	Then what do we know about Jannah?
443000	445000	Is it better in this world or no?
445000	448000	In this world, poor guy, he has to go to college,
448000	450000	he has to fail a test, he has to take a review,
450000	453000	he has to pay the tuition, he has to convince his parents,
453000	455000	I want to get married, I want to get married.
455000	457000	They don't let him get married.
457000	460000	He finally likes a girl and he proposes and then she says no.
460000	465000	And then, there's so much he's got to go through, poor guy.
465000	467000	And then eventually he gets married and he's like,
467000	470000	this is not going to be the most amazing thing ever because I'm married.
470000	472000	And then he finds out what marriage is.
472000	480000	And then, you know, then he's changing diapers in no time and
480000	483000	they don't smell that good.
483000	487000	You know, every joy comes with pain in this life, doesn't it?
487000	489000	Getting a new job is joy.
489000	494000	But after a couple of days on the job, getting a nice car.
494000	495000	Awesome.
495000	498000	Getting stuck in traffic.
498000	501000	You know, first time people sit on a plane,
501000	504000	like if you get kids on a plane.
504000	509000	Six hours later on the same flight.
509000	512000	Where are we landing?
512000	517000	If you have the guarantee of Jadna, you're not going to get old.
517000	519000	You're not going to get sick.
519000	523000	You're going to have the best housing, the best spouse, no problems.
523000	525000	What are you doing here?
525000	529000	Gold role?
529000	535000	Because there's no point being here if you have so much better waiting for you.
535000	541000	You don't have to deal with war and famine and disease and sickness and old age.
541000	544000	There's nothing. Go.
544000	547000	You know what this, Allah is not telling them to wish for death.
547000	552000	Allah is saying if you actually believed what you believed, you would be.
552000	554000	You understand the point here?
554000	556000	Do we believe this?
556000	560000	And because we don't believe this, we don't wish for what?
560000	562000	We wish for a good death.
562000	563000	We don't wish for death.
563000	564000	We wish for A. Good.
564000	566000	And we don't know when that is.
566000	570000	So we don't wish for it because we're not sure if we're ready for it yet.
570000	572000	We just, yeah, Allah just give us a good death.
572000	574000	Give us death among good people.
574000	576000	Give us death while we're in a state of Islam.
576000	578000	Give us death when we're in a state of Taqwa.
578000	580000	This is our doves.
580000	582000	A completely different worldview.
582000	586000	And Allah is saying anybody who believes that they are saved in some way,
586000	589000	they should be wishing like this.
589000	593000	Now, it's the Mandun in us is also really interesting because right before this,
593000	596000	when the previous section that we were discussing, what did Allah tell us?
596000	600000	These Umayyin are coming into the final this religion of God.
600000	604000	And then the Umayyin invitation is being opened to every nation on earth.
604000	609000	All the people that weren't going into Jannah now have a chance to be purified.
609000	612000	And you're like, no, they're not going to go to Jannah.
612000	613000	Where the hell are they going to go to Jannah?
613000	615000	Well, then go.
615000	617000	Put them a down vote.
617000	619000	Go ahead.
619000	621000	In Qutul Saad-i-Qeen.
621000	622000	These are some other ayat.
622000	625000	Actually, I won't go through them because that level take too long for you guys.
625000	631000	But for your own homework, you should kind of look at places in the Quran where the word wadi is used.
631000	636000	Just as an analysis, like what is the word, the relationship between me and Allah of wadi?
636000	637000	What does it look like?
637000	640000	These are a couple of ayat that I selected like Allah,
640000	644000	wa li-latina, aamanu yusriju'un min al-lumati lannu.
644000	647000	Allah is the protective friend of those who believe.
647000	650000	He pulls them out of darknesses and brings them into light.
650000	653000	By the way, the second ayat of this Surah,
653000	657000	yaddu alayhim ayatihi wa yuzakkihim wa yu'alimu al-kitab wa al-hikmah, you know what that is?
657000	663000	Allah pulling people out of darkness into light, which means Allah is being their wadi.
663000	669000	Because Allah says in Surat Al-Baqarah, Allah as a wadi, pulls people out of darkness into light.
669000	670000	It's pahadallah.
670000	673000	That's what wadi actually does.
673000	676000	That's what the wadi, if you're truly the awliya' of Allah,
676000	679000	then you're journeying from darkness towards light.
679000	680000	That's what you're doing.
680000	683000	And every day you're identifying some other kind of darkness
683000	686000	and you're making another step and another step and another step and another step.
686000	689000	That's when you're awliya' of Allah.
689000	691000	By the way, the term awliya' of Allah,
691000	693000	I'm going to say something that's going to sound controversial to you guys,
693000	695000	but it's okay, I'm leaving in a few days.
697000	700000	We have this concept in some of our Islamic traditions
700000	703000	where some people are considered the awliya' of Allah.
703000	706000	And even nowadays there are some traditions in which people say,
706000	709000	I have a wadi of Allah in my neighborhood.
709000	711000	I have a wadi of Allah in our village.
711000	712000	We have a wadi.
712000	713000	Right?
713000	714000	These are the...
714000	716000	And what is a common threat among...
716000	718000	It's in different cultures, by the way.
718000	721000	It's in South Asia, it's in Southeast Asia, it's in different places.
721000	723000	Turkey, other places, right?
723000	727000	And these awliya' of Allah, they are deeply connected with Allah like you cannot be.
727000	731000	What they all have in common is they're spiritually connected to Allah.
731000	732000	You're not.
732000	736000	And they can help you get closer to Allah because they're already...
736000	739000	They already graduated from the school of distance.
739000	741000	They're in the school of closeness to Allah.
741000	742000	You're not.
742000	745000	And they are the ones that are going to elevate you.
745000	746000	Right?
747000	748000	When you...
748000	751000	When someone declares that they are closer to Allah,
752000	754000	doesn't that sound like disassumption?
755000	756000	Doesn't that sound like...
756000	760000	Like, I can't imagine as a student that I'm not like that.
761000	764000	As a student of the Quran, at any point in my life,
764000	767000	I can say about myself, I am a what?
768000	775000	I would say, I pray that Allah considers me...
775000	777000	Allah is my wadi.
777000	782000	And it would be an honor that Allah would declare me His wadi.
782000	785000	Actually, because who decides if I'm a wadi to Allah,
785000	787000	it's more Allah's decision than mine.
787000	788000	Right?
788000	790000	Allah is the best.
790000	792000	Allah is the wadi.
792000	798000	Because it would be very self-righteous of me to declare myself a wadi of Allah.
798000	801000	And the thing is that every one of us has ups and downs.
801000	803000	We're human, right?
803000	804000	We have ups and downs.
804000	808000	Do you think at some point you will become so good that you no longer have ups and downs?
808000	810000	Is that possible for you?
810000	813000	But why do you think it's possible for someone else?
813000	816000	Why would you think that somebody has reached a certain status?
816000	817000	They become the Pope now?
817000	818000	They can't come down.
818000	822000	They've already reached the level of angels and they can't dip from that.
822000	825000	And therefore, all of their prayers are answered.
825000	829000	We can do all the good deeds in the world and we can mess it up.
829000	833000	And we can be drowning in sin and we can make doba and be raised.
833000	837000	Allah increases anybody in ranks.
837000	840000	And you know,
840000	844000	So this mentality that Allah is describing about,
844000	847000	we've exhibited some of these behaviors.
847000	848000	And you know what?
848000	852000	Wherever you find this kind of behavior, you find a lot of problems too.
852000	854000	You find a lot of problems.
854000	858000	This mentality creates problems in that society.
858000	859000	It creates cults.
859000	861000	It creates people worship.
861000	864000	It creates, it's a new kind of idol worship.
864000	869000	You know, and these people can't be wrong because they represent the will of Allah Himself.
869000	872000	That's exactly what the Pope says.
872000	874000	What these other religions say.
874000	878000	The rabbinical tradition believed that the rabbis are so close to God
878000	882000	that when they give a fatwa, it actually represents the will of God Himself.
882000	887000	That's why the Talmud kept any additions made to the Talmud is considered sacred.
887000	890000	It's actually considered part of the word of God.
890000	893000	Their opinion is considered part of the word of God.
893000	895000	You know?
895000	899000	And this is the kind of thing that the Quran came to eliminate.
899000	903000	You know, one of my friends said this really, he was a student of history
903000	905000	and he said something really cool.
905000	909000	He said religions before Islam, they were superstitious.
909000	913000	They had people that you had to go through to connect to God.
913000	915000	Intermediaries, you had to go through them.
915000	919000	And religions were all about granting people wishes.
919000	921000	So why did people go to a religion?
921000	923000	Because they want to get married.
923000	924000	Why do people go to a religion?
924000	926000	Because they want more money.
926000	927000	Or they want to get out of debt.
927000	929000	Or they want to solve a problem.
929000	930000	Or they want to heal a child.
930000	931000	Or have a child.
931000	932000	Or whatever. Wishes.
932000	935000	So people go to a religion for these things.
935000	938000	And Islam came and reconstructed, restored.
938000	941000	The purpose of true religion is not these things.
941000	945000	You don't have to go through anybody because you are a slave of Allah directly.
945000	952000	The messenger, sallallahu alaihi wasalam, will teach you how to connect to Allah yourself.
952000	956000	The messenger will give you the word of Allah that you must engage with directly.
956000	958000	Sallallahu alaihi wasalam.
958000	960000	A direct bond between the slave and Allah.
961000	966000	And all of us together trying to bond with Allah, subhanAllah, this communal.
966000	970000	And by the way, does that mean you shouldn't be learning from someone or have a role model?
970000	973000	Yes, but a father should have been the role model to his children.
973000	978000	And the grandfather should have been the role model to the entire family.
978000	982000	Among your friends, the more knowledgeable become a role model in learning and in behavior.
982000	988000	It wasn't supposed to be some special class of people that are designated holy people.
988000	993000	Because this holy class was actually something that every other religion used to have.
993000	996000	But Islam came and everybody became what?
996000	997000	Equal.
997000	1002000	Though the final speech of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasalam, nobody is better than anybody except by what designation?
1002000	1005000	Takwa and Takwa lies in the heart and you can't see it.
1005000	1008000	I can't see your Takwa, you can't see mine. It's invisible.
1008000	1011000	What did we do? We created Takwa uniforms.
1011000	1016000	Okay, but if you dress the certain way, you look as if there is Takwa guy walking around.
1016000	1021000	When Takwa man walks into the restaurant, everybody comes out.
1021000	1024000	Let me go get him to make the du'as for me.
1024000	1027000	Because his du'as get accepted.
1027000	1029000	You know, there's Takwa ladies too.
1029000	1034000	When they walk into a party, nobody has fun anymore.
1034000	1036000	You know who they are.
1036000	1038000	You know, they have a certain walk.
1038000	1040000	They have a certain look.
1040000	1042000	Haas, Tal Fiddle.
1042000	1044000	Speak of it.
1044000	1046000	Everybody is eating chicken.
1046000	1048000	There was a stop for that.
1048000	1051000	That kind of istighfar needs a stighfar.
1051000	1058000	Honestly, you know, this demonstration of spirituality, come on.
1058000	1062000	This is, these kinds of aiyat, you know what they do?
1062000	1069000	They shatter the idea of posturing and presenting yourself as sacred?
1069000	1072000	Well, that's not actually the case.
1072000	1074000	That's actually what the aiyat do.
1074000	1077000	But I'm a no-l note in kundub saddikh.
1077000	1078000	Go ahead.
1078000	1080000	What are you doing in this world then?
1080000	1082000	You know, if you wish for that, the word temenni.
1082000	1083000	I didn't know this.
1083000	1084000	I learned this today.
1084000	1088000	I was today years old when I learned this.
1088000	1092000	The word temenni, which means wish, I translated as wish,
1092000	1095000	actually comes from many, which means sperm.
1095000	1097000	I was like, what is sperm and wish?
1097000	1099000	What do they have to do with each other?
1099000	1101000	The erids were so creative.
1101000	1103000	Like, I read this in Imam Rahman, but that's fahadi.
1103000	1104000	It's really cool.
1104000	1106000	I'm just one piece of it I'm sharing with you.
1106000	1113000	First, the erids were fascinated that this fluid turns into a full-on human being.
1113000	1118000	So they thought this thing, this liquid, does the impossible.
1118000	1124000	So they thought of the birth of a child as something impossible that happens.
1124000	1129000	So they associated many with that which can't possibly happen.
1129000	1131000	And from it, I'll read it.
1131000	1134000	Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.
1134000	1137000	Just before you continue, I want to let you know and encourage you
1137000	1140000	that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com and help other sign up,
1140000	1145000	even sponsor students for bayinatv.com so we can create worldwide communities of students
1145000	1148000	that are studying the meanings and the benefit and the wisdom of the Quran
1148000	1151000	and are insha'Allah ta'ala spreading that in their own circles.
1151000	1152000	Thanks so much.
1152000	1155000	And the word temenni also meant something that's very limited
1155000	1160000	because they think this little drop and an entire baby, you know,
1160000	1163000	something very limited that's producing something massive.
1163000	1166000	Because we are able to identify something in the same way as the picture.
1166000	1170000	And that could be about thinking and thinking.
1170000	1172000	Meaning they're just using some imagination.
1172000	1173000	How could this happen?
1173000	1175000	From this limited thing, this massive human being.
1175000	1178000	And it could be about a vision and a building on the inside.
1178000	1183000	But when he was more on thinking, he became a liar for your own good.
1183000	1192000	So they used to actually think temenni is always believing something impossible.
1192000	1196000	Like something it became associated with something impossible.
1196000	1198000	What does that mean?
1198000	1202000	And imagining something that could possibly be true.
1202000	1204000	And that's why he said,
1204000	1205000	I'm going to be a liar.
1205000	1207000	And that's why I'm going to be a liar.
1207000	1209000	Unlike the translation.
1209000	1213000	So the word temenni started getting used for things that are impossible.
1213000	1217000	Like they thought the birth of a child is just some impossible mysterious thing.
1217000	1218000	It can't be this.
1218000	1220000	There's got to be something else.
1220000	1222000	How could this happen?
1222000	1226000	So the word temenni became wishing for impossible things.
1226000	1230000	Having what you can call delusional wishes.
1230000	1233000	Delusional wishes would be called temenni.
1233000	1235000	And amani, another word in the Quran.
1236000	1238000	Unless it's laisa bi alani yukum,
1238000	1241000	the religion is not based on your delusional thinking.
1241000	1242000	Your wishes.
1242000	1244000	The religion is not about your wishes.
1244000	1247000	Amlilin sa'adim ataman na Quranahs.
1247000	1250000	The human being just get whatever he delusional wishes for.
1250000	1252000	You're just going to get whatever you wish for.
1252000	1253000	That's what you think?
1253000	1257000	And I said this in my delus on previous surahs.
1257000	1259000	But I'll just briefly mention this to you.
1259000	1262000	Temenni as a concept.
1262000	1264000	Other religions, like I told you,
1264000	1267000	people would go up 10,000 steps on a mountain
1267000	1269000	to stand in front of a statue to say,
1269000	1273000	please make her fall in love with me.
1273000	1274000	Right?
1274000	1277000	They go up there not to become spiritually elevated or whatever.
1277000	1280000	They go up there for some wish that they need to get answered.
1280000	1281000	You understand?
1281000	1282000	The money to be blessed.
1282000	1283000	The child to be blessed.
1283000	1284000	The marriage to happen.
1284000	1286000	The problem to be solved.
1286000	1287000	This was all religion.
1287000	1290000	It was a transaction between them and the gods.
1290000	1296000	I present to you this, you know, bowl of milk and this Kit Kat.
1296000	1300000	Please allow me to pass the exam.
1300000	1301000	I will give you this.
1301000	1304000	These gods will give me something.
1304000	1306000	The Vikings and these guys,
1306000	1308000	they would sacrifice somebody so that their gods,
1308000	1312000	Odin or whoever would help them in victory against the enemy.
1312000	1315000	Because the gods won't help if we don't give them something.
1315000	1317000	You got to give them something, then they'll give you something.
1317000	1318000	It's a transaction.
1318000	1320000	It's a transaction with the gods.
1320000	1322000	Right?
1322000	1325000	Our religion, is it a transaction with Allah?
1325000	1326000	No.
1326000	1328000	But you know what you find some people doing?
1328000	1330000	I used to pray.
1330000	1331000	I fasted.
1331000	1333000	I even didn't even drink any Haram.
1333000	1335000	I didn't eat any Haram.
1335000	1337000	And I only asked Allah for one thing.
1337000	1339000	And I kept making dua and I kept making dua
1339000	1341000	and Allah didn't give it to me.
1341000	1344000	Why should I pray?
1344000	1346000	I think you should try a different religion
1346000	1348000	where you can go up 10,000 steps
1348000	1351000	and place your order after making your payment.
1351000	1355000	Because in your mind, prayer and fasting
1355000	1359000	and abiding by Sharia was your form of what?
1359000	1360000	Payment.
1360000	1362000	And now that you made the payment,
1362000	1365000	you're expecting compensation.
1365000	1368000	You must not have understood what this religion is.
1368000	1372000	You may have thought this was some kind of a transaction.
1372000	1374000	It's not a transaction.
1374000	1377000	This religion gives you purpose.
1377000	1379000	And another religion you might say,
1379000	1380000	follow this religion,
1380000	1381000	we'll get you what you want.
1381000	1384000	Like I heard Joel Stien say all the time.
1384000	1386000	Joel Stien, I've mentioned this a lot
1386000	1389000	because I've learned so much from that experience.
1389000	1391000	When I went to his special in Christmas,
1391000	1394000	I went to his Christmas special at the American Airlines Theater.
1394000	1395000	That's what I do on Christmas.
1395000	1397000	I go to a big Christian thing.
1397000	1399000	I've done it once.
1399000	1401000	I think I'll do it again though. It's fun.
1401000	1402000	I got a ticket. I'm sitting in the back
1402000	1403000	and he's like,
1403000	1405000	what are these Christians going to talk about on Christmas?
1405000	1407000	And he's one of the biggest preachers in America, right?
1407000	1408000	For a while.
1408000	1410000	And he goes up, this year,
1410000	1413000	your divorce is going to be finished.
1413000	1416000	The lawyers, they're not going to come after you no more.
1416000	1418000	This year, you're going to get your promotion.
1418000	1422000	This year, that cancer, it's going to be gone.
1422000	1424000	And there's like 20,000 people sitting in the city,
1424000	1426000	and I'm like, yes, yes it is.
1426000	1427000	Yes it is.
1427000	1429000	Yup, yup.
1429000	1431000	He's giving them whatever they have.
1431000	1433000	Taman Nio, Amani, Amani, Amani.
1433000	1437000	And you just, Jesus is going to take care of all your problems.
1437000	1439000	And people are like, yes he is.
1439000	1441000	Yes he is.
1441000	1442000	And what do we do?
1442000	1446000	Brother, when's the 27th night of Ramadan?
1446000	1449000	When's the 27th night?
1449000	1451000	Why you want to know about the 27th night?
1451000	1453000	Oh, just I just have to make Duhah.
1453000	1454000	I have to recite a lot.
1454000	1456000	Why are you reciting so much Quran?
1456000	1457000	Why are you reciting making so much?
1457000	1459000	Because it's the 27th that you want rewards.
1459000	1460000	You want to let it give you guidance.
1460000	1462000	You want to let it give you purpose in life.
1462000	1464000	You want to let it forgive your sins.
1464000	1467000	Nah, nah, nah.
1467000	1469000	This Defaat is cool.
1469000	1473000	But I actually have some really important things I want to ask about.
1473000	1480000	Like Abdu'l-Karim's family hasn't called back with the proposal.
1480000	1483000	What did we do with our religion?
1483000	1486000	Our religion gave us higher purpose.
1486000	1491000	But humanity really gets stuck in worldly things.
1491000	1497000	So what we did is we re-engineered our religion back towards what other religions do with theirs.
1497000	1499000	Slowly but surely we redirected it.
1499000	1502000	And you know the only way that redirection is possible?
1502000	1505000	Distance from the Quran.
1505000	1507000	Should you ask for things from Allah?
1507000	1512000	Yeah, I know some of you were like, are you saying I can't make Duhah for anything anymore?
1512000	1513000	Allah said,
1513000	1516000	رَبَلَا عَاتِنَ فِيْدُنْيَا حَسَرَ وَفِنَا خِرَتِيْ
1516000	1519000	Of course you should make Duhah.
1519000	1520000	But you know what?
1520000	1526000	When wanting things of this world becomes your fundamental relationship with Allah.
1526000	1531000	Your fundamental, and I explained this with one analogy, please keep this analogy with you.
1531000	1532000	It will help.
1532000	1535000	Imagine you're going from here, you're driving from here to Hamburg.
1535000	1536000	Road trip.
1536000	1539000	When you're driving from here to Hamburg, are you going to stop for gas or no?
1539000	1541000	You're going to have to.
1541000	1543000	Except for fuel, there's a restroom, eat some food.
1543000	1544000	Isn't it?
1544000	1547000	Now imagine you stop at a restroom and you're like, this place is amazing.
1547000	1550000	I've never seen a gas station this nice.
1550000	1553000	And you just live in the gas station.
1553000	1555000	They sh**.
1555000	1557000	Bro, the gas station is nice.
1557000	1559000	I know they make really good french fries.
1559000	1560000	I get it.
1560000	1564000	You really like the scenery.
1564000	1566000	But this was a stop.
1566000	1567000	You can enjoy the stop.
1567000	1569000	But then what must you do?
1569000	1570000	Move on.
1570000	1572000	And then you'll get hungry again.
1572000	1573000	You'll stop again.
1573000	1574000	And you'll move.
1574000	1575000	And you'll refuel.
1575000	1576000	And you'll move again.
1576000	1580000	Experiences in this life are like what?
1580000	1582000	The gas station.
1582000	1585000	The destination is something bigger and greater.
1585000	1587000	What happens to us?
1587000	1588000	There's one experience in our life.
1588000	1591000	One thing we want, like the gas station, we get where?
1591000	1593000	This is what I want.
1593000	1594000	This is my new goal.
1594000	1596000	No, no, you have something bigger.
1596000	1597000	No, no, no, but this though.
1597000	1599000	This though.
1599000	1602000	Once I have this, then I can...
1602000	1605000	You know, we get distracted on the way.
1605000	1607000	There's a road we're on.
1607000	1610000	And in that road, some things will come to us.
1610000	1612000	Some things will be taken away from us.
1612000	1613000	People will come in our life.
1613000	1615000	People will go from our lives.
1615000	1616000	Opportunities will come.
1616000	1617000	Opportunities will go.
1617000	1618000	Money will come.
1618000	1619000	Money will go.
1619000	1620000	Health will come. Health will go.
1620000	1621000	There will be ups and downs in this life.
1621000	1623000	But none of those things are objective.
1623000	1624000	They are experiences.
1624000	1626000	We will be grateful for the beautiful experiences.
1626000	1630000	We will be patient and still grateful for the tough experiences.
1630000	1632000	We'll keep moving forward.
1632000	1636000	But you can't get stuck in a gas station, you know?
1636000	1639000	And that's part of the lesson to learn here.
1639000	1641000	And then finally in Quntum Saad-i-Qinala,
1641000	1643000	and with that, Chawla, I'll give you your break,
1643000	1646000	is if in fact you're telling the truth,
1646000	1648000	the word truth, I want you to understand something about it.
1648000	1650000	Siddhq, means truth.
1650000	1653000	But actually, you know a spear, right?
1653000	1657000	Belonging, throw, kill, thingy.
1657000	1660000	If the middle of the spear is weak,
1660000	1662000	then it can be easily broken.
1662000	1668000	But when the middle of the spear is thick and unbreakable,
1668000	1673000	that kind of spear is actually called ruhun siddhq.
1673000	1676000	An unbreakable, strong spear.
1676000	1679000	A man who cannot be beaten on the battlefield,
1679000	1682000	unbreakable man is rajulun siddhq.
1682000	1685000	And assault and attack on the enemy,
1685000	1687000	which could not be defended against,
1687000	1689000	is called hamlatun siddhq.
1689000	1693000	From it, you get the strongest kind of friend
1693000	1695000	who doesn't break the bonds of friendship.
1695000	1697000	The most true kind of friend.
1697000	1699000	When things are tough, they're your friend.
1699000	1701000	When things are easy, they're your friend.
1701000	1703000	They're not an opportunist friend.
1703000	1707000	Opportunist friend, that kind of friend is a siddhq.
1707000	1709000	From the same word, siddhq.
1709000	1715000	Siddhq truth actually means something strong that doesn't break.
1715000	1718000	The idea of truth in Arabic is actually strength.
1718000	1722000	And you might not know this, but kehrib, which is lie,
1722000	1726000	actually comes from an animal that when it walks,
1726000	1729000	it stops and it looks back to see if something's coming for it.
1729000	1733000	Then it walks and it yataraddad fil mashih.
1733000	1737000	It hesitates in its movement and it's actually weak.
1737000	1740000	It's weak and the opposite of strong.
1740000	1744000	And it's also interesting that kehrib has to do with defense
1744000	1746000	and siddhq has to do with offense.
1746000	1749000	By the etymology of these words,
1749000	1751000	but Allah says in Qutum Saadikim,
1751000	1754000	He's saying, read easy translation if you're truthful,
1754000	1757000	but behind these words is, if you stand on firm ground.
1757000	1760000	If what you believe is actually strong and solid,
1760000	1763000	it's based on something that never shakes.
1763000	1765000	And in it, Allah is making an invitation.
1765000	1769000	People that will hold on to this faith have to have firm, solid base.
1769000	1771000	Why am I a believer? Why am I a Muslim?
1771000	1774000	Why do I believe this to be the word of God?
1774000	1780000	How? That takes us back to yatlu aleyhi mayatihi wa mizakim.
1780000	1785000	Those two, they actually make you clear about why you're a believer.
1785000	1790000	They make you firm on why must you hold on to this book.
1790000	1792000	They make you firm on that.
1792000	1795000	We've become obsessed with the book.
1795000	1798000	Actually, not even the hikmah. We've obsessed with the book.
1798000	1800000	We just say, oh, Muslims are doing this.
1800000	1803000	There's corruption here. Young youth are doing this.
1803000	1805000	They're eating haram. They're earning haram.
1805000	1807000	They're dressing haram. They're doing haram haram haram.
1807000	1811000	Actually, violation of kitab here, violation of kitab here, violation of kitab here.
1811000	1815000	Nobody stops to ask the question, why is this 18-year-old doing drugs?
1815000	1817000	Why is this 17-year-old drinking?
1817000	1819000	Would you ask him, do you believe in the Quran?
1819000	1823000	I guess. Why do you believe in my parents are Muslim?
1823000	1826000	I guess I believe. Is that strong?
1826000	1828000	Does that sound like a spear that doesn't break?
1828000	1830000	No.
1830000	1833000	And then if you watch an inspirational video,
1833000	1836000	you watch like, you know, people sometimes take my clips.
1836000	1839000	I don't know why they take my clips. My clips are depressing, but, you know,
1839000	1842000	other people, you watch like a Mufti Mank video.
1842000	1844000	And the money you've done just went up.
1844000	1846000	So good.
1846000	1848000	I'm so Muslim right now.
1848000	1851000	I'm going to share this with everyone.
1851000	1854000	I want to make this my WhatsApp story.
1854000	1855000	Right?
1855000	1858000	Your iman is emotional. You hear something inspirational?
1858000	1860000	Goes up.
1860000	1862000	Then what happens?
1862000	1864000	You all know what happens next?
1864000	1866000	Way down.
1866000	1868000	Then you're depressed.
1868000	1870000	And then you watch something emotional.
1870000	1873000	Then down here again.
1873000	1875000	You know what that means?
1875000	1878000	It's based on which your faith sits.
1878000	1881000	Depends on your mood.
1881000	1882000	Depends.
1882000	1885000	And is your mood something stable?
1885000	1887000	Is my mood something stable?
1887000	1891000	My iman cannot be based on something emotional.
1891000	1895000	My iman has to be based on something much more solid than emotions,
1895000	1898000	because emotions are always up and down.
1898000	1903000	The iman has to be based on something that I'm absolutely clearly convinced of
1903000	1905000	to be the truth.
1905000	1908000	I'm intellectually cleansed, emotionally cleansed.
1908000	1911000	And if it's sitting on that intellectual basis,
1911000	1913000	that this is in fact al-haq,
1913000	1916000	then my emotions will go up and down, sure,
1916000	1920000	but they won't go below my convictions.
1920000	1923000	I'm never going to get to a point where I'm okay with alcohol now,
1923000	1925000	or I'm okay with stealing now.
1925000	1926000	No, no, no.
1926000	1928000	I'll feel a lesser iman sometimes,
1928000	1930000	but there's a minimum threshold,
1930000	1934000	and the iman is so solid, it doesn't let me go below that.
1934000	1936000	And if my iman is easily going below that,
1936000	1939000	it's because that base hasn't been built.
1939000	1942000	And that's the base that the Quran builds.
1942000	1945000	That's where yatlu a'layhi ma'ayatihi wa yuzakhi'in comes from.
1945000	1948000	And I've been taking a super long time for this session,
1948000	1950000	but as we come to this,
1950000	1953000	one thing I forgot to mention yesterday, and I should have mentioned it,
1953000	1957000	Allah says about these people in the previous ayah,
1957000	1959000	that they lost their relationship with their book.
1959000	1961000	Basically, it was a non-relationship.
1961000	1965000	They have a book like Donkeys Carrying a Load, right?
1965000	1969000	This ayah is strategically right after Allah mentioned
1969000	1972000	the four-step process from the Prophet's license.
1972000	1974000	You know why that's important?
1974000	1978000	That's important because if we ever abandon that four-step process,
1978000	1981000	we will end up in this exact situation.
1981000	1984000	That actually, that four-step process,
1984000	1987000	starting with yatlu a'layhi ma'ayatihi wa yuzakhi'in,
1987000	1989000	then you'll learn the book and the book.
1989000	1991000	If we leave that four-step process,
1991000	1993000	we will end up in this exact place,
1993000	1995000	Kamafal il-Himari Yahmi al-Wasfara.
1995000	1997000	May Allah protect us from that.
1997000	2000000	So let's take your break, inshallah. Enjoy a good 10 minutes.
2000000	2002000	Assalamu alaikum everyone.
2002000	2004000	There are almost 50,000 students around the world
2004000	2007000	that are interested on top of the students we have
2007000	2009000	in studying the Quran and its meanings
2009000	2012000	and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.
2012000	2014000	And they need sponsorships, which is not very expensive.
2014000	2017000	So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV,
2017000	2019000	please do so and visit our sponsorship page.
2019000	2020000	I appreciate it so much.
2020000	2022000	And pray that Allah gives our mission success
2022000	2024000	and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran
2024000	2026000	and the beauty of it the world over.
