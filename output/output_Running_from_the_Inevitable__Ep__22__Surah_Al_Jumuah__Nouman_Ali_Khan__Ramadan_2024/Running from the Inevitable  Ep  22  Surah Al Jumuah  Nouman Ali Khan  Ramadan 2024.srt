1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
You will be returned to Allah.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,200
Thumma tur ad-duna ilallah.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,320
Make sense?

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,820
Allah chose to say,

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,860
you will be returned to the one who knows the unseen and the seen.

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,060
What does that have to do with this conversation?

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,540
What it has to do with is,

8
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,860
people that look religious on the outside,

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,700
but don't actually have faith on the inside affecting their hearts.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,700
The Death Which You Are Running From

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,200
So, the death which you are running from,

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,400
fa innahum mulaqi kum, it is going to meet you.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,600
Thumma tur ad-duna ila alim il-gaybi wa shahada.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,400
Then you will be returned back to the knower of the unseen and the seen.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,700
Fa yunabbiyukum bima kuntum ta'maloon,

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,200
then he will inform you of what you used to do.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,800
That's the last ayah for the day.

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,300
Separated, so farra taferuna minhu,

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,500
the death you are running from comes from farfara,

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,100
or iftarra, when you show your teeth when you're laughing.

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,600
And when someone moves in a quick fashion,

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,700
when your mouth moves, you'll be like,

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,200
like that's farra, or iftarra.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,700
Farfara al-ba'een, when a camel shakes its body,

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,600
al-mafar means a place to flee or run away from.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
Actually, the wise meaning is not that important.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,100
A well-fed lamb, wow, that's a really well-fed lamb.

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

29
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,500
I think it's called that because it's fur shakes and stuff,

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,900
because it's so fat.

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,900
But anyway, so the idea of farra is something that moves quickly.

32
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,000
Like quick running, quick dashing.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,800
Escaping also is farar, farrat bin qaswara.

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,900
Right? Donkeys or mules are there,

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,500
and they see a lion coming and the donkeys run, dash for it.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,200
That's the word farra also.

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,700
Allah says, tell them, say this,

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,100
no doubt about it, the death which you are running away from.

39
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,500
How can somebody run away from death?

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,000
They're not running away from death.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,800
They're running away from the conversation about death.

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,100
They're running away from the preparation of death.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,900
They're running away from facing the fact of death.

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,900
They're running away from that.

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,400
Allah says, you can run from that all you want.

46
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,600
Fa innahu mulaqikum.

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,800
Then no doubt about it, it is going to meet you.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,200
Arabic students will notice here,

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,500
mulaqikum is a mulaaf and mulaafi lay.

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Laqa yulaqi l-qa'an wa mulaqatan,

51
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,900
fa hua mulaqin.

52
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,400
This is an ism fa'il from laqa, which means to meet.

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,600
In the Arabic language, when an ism fa'il, mulaq,

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,100
or mulaqi, is used as a mulaaf,

55
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,200
it means it's already happened.

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,300
So, innahu mulaqin iyakum.

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,700
That would mean it will meet you.

58
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,900
Mulaqiikum actually means it's already met you.

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,700
It's as good as already done.

60
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,900
It's guaranteed.

61
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,000
You have to think of it as immediate.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,800
It's already passed.

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,900
You know, the difference between

64
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,000
he is going to help him

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,700
as opposed to he is his helper.

66
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,200
When you say he's his helper, the help is already done.

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,500
If I say he's going to teach him,

68
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,600
the teaching hasn't happened yet.

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
But if I say he's his teacher,

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,300
the teaching is already happening.

71
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
It is your meter.

72
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,100
Not going to meet you,

73
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,200
literally says meter, but what's meant to say is,

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,400
it's going to meet you.

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,800
But the language used is,

76
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,300
it's considerate done.

77
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,700
Considerate already done.

78
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,400
That's how immediate we should be thinking about death.

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,300
Then he says,

80
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,700
ثم تردونه,

81
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,700
ملاقيه,

82
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,100
let's look at لقيه also.

83
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,900
لقيه actually means something that's thrown in your path.

84
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,300
And لاقه means to meet someone,

85
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,900
to come into contact with someone.

86
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,200
إلقه, like you know,

87
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,500
Musa A.S. was told to throw the staff.

88
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,100
That was ألقه يا موسى.

89
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,200
So إلقه was used for that purpose.

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
So لاقه means when you just stumble upon somebody,

91
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,900
you run into somebody.

92
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,900
This is why enemy forces,

93
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,800
when they clash against each other,

94
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,100
that's actually called تلقي.

95
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,900
إذ يتلق المتلقيان also.

96
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,000
Or إلتقاء actually.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
قد كان لكم آية ونفي في أتيني التقطة.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,100
سلطة العمران,

99
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,800
when the Muslims and the enemies met on the Battle of Badr,

100
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,600
that was في أتين التقطة.

101
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,300
And similarly, when the oceans collapse into each other.

102
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,600
مرج البحريني يلتقيان from the same origin,

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,500
when they crash into each other.

104
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,000
So the same way, death will come crashing towards you.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It'll just run right into you, bump right into you.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,400
It's not going to come with like a four meeting or four warning.

107
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,100
It's just going to show up.

108
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,800
ثم تردول إلى عالم الغيب والشهادة.

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,200
Then you will be returned.

110
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,500
Now let's focus on the word returned.

111
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,600
رد is the shortening of the chin

112
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,800
when you pull your face backwards.

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,500
And رد is whatever organ is shrinking.

114
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,300
رد is a camel that drinks water,

115
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,800
meaning it pulls back its udders.

116
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,900
Now the important thing is ردود الدراهم.

117
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,500
Basically, if you give somebody fake money

118
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
and they give it back to you, that's not real money.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Those are not real euros.

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
Like you just drew an E on there and give it to me.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Then that's مردود.

122
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,700
It's rejected because it's not of any value.

123
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,300
So there's the Arabic word for returning

124
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,000
and there's returning when you have no value.

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,300
Return because it's faulty.

126
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,400
Like when you somebody ships you a product on a,

127
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,500
you guys get Amazon here?

128
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,300
You got Amazon?

129
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
Okay.

130
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,000
Because some countries don't get Amazon, I'm so surprised.

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,400
Anyway, it's the jihad.

132
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,200
It's how we should be everywhere.

133
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
Okay, anyway.

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,000
So, I don't know.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,300
Yeah, my weird humor.

136
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,300
Anyway, so you get a faulty product on Amazon and you return it

137
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,500
because it's faulty.

138
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,000
That product would be مردود.

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,900
That would be مردود.

140
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,300
That's رد.

141
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,100
Okay.

142
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,600
Allah says you will be returned,

143
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,900
meaning you are going to be returned in a faulty state.

144
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,700
These people are being told you're faulty.

145
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,800
If it was just a normal return, it would be ثم ترجعون.

146
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
ثم ترجعون or تعودون or تعادون.

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
Or you know, so there would be different words

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,200
that were or تعادون actually.

149
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,300
But here تردون means you are going to be returned back

150
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,500
as faulty as you are.

151
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,700
Meaning you're not going to come to Allah pure.

152
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,200
You're going to come to Allah impure.

153
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,000
And that's inside the word رد.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
You know?

155
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,200
Now ثم ترجعون إلى علم الغيب والشهادتي.

156
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,800
You will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the seen.

157
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,900
Why is it important for Allah to say the knower of the unseen

158
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,100
and the seen instead of just saying you will be returned to Allah?

159
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,000
ثم ترجعون إلى الله.

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,200
Make sense?

161
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Allah chose to say you will be returned to the one

162
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,600
who knows the unseen and the seen.

163
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,800
What does that have to do with this conversation?

164
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,500
What it has to do with is people that look religious on the outside,

165
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,400
but don't actually have faith on the inside affecting their hearts.

166
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,500
And when we go back to Allah,

167
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,900
how religious I looked on the outside,

168
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,600
how religious I sounded on the outside,

169
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
how religious I practiced on the outside,

170
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,900
that's all شهادة.

171
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,700
شهادة means you can see it.

172
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,100
You can see somebody praying.

173
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,600
You can see somebody giving a lecture.

174
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,500
You can see somebody reciting Quran.

175
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,100
You can see somebody dressed religiously.

176
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,900
You can see that.

177
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,200
But what you cannot see is what?

178
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,700
Somebody may be worshiping Allah in the scene,

179
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,900
but running away from death in their hearts, right?

180
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,300
Because this running from death is not a seen thing.

181
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,200
It's an unseen thing.

182
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,000
Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Just before you continue,

184
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
I want to let you know and encourage you

185
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,200
that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com

186
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,500
and help other sign up,

187
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,700
even sponsor students for bayinatv.com

188
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,200
so we can create worldwide communities of students

189
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,100
that are studying the meanings and the benefit

190
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,800
and the wisdom of the Quran

191
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,600
and are, insha'Allah,

192
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,100
spreading that in their own circles.

193
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,500
Thanks so much.

194
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,600
What is going to be exposed on judgment day?

195
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,800
Something that could not be exposed in this life,

196
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,100
which is the unseen.

197
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,300
So notice Allah put priority over the unseen here.

198
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,600
He said,

199
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,500
He said,

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and also the scene.

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,800
All both of them together.

202
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,400
You know, this takes us back to the letter of the law

203
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,500
and the spirit of the law.

204
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,700
Kitab is seen,

205
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,500
Hikmah is the unseen spirit of it, isn't it?

206
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,800
Alimil ghaybi wa shahada.

207
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,500
Fa yunab bi'ukum bima.

208
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,100
And by the way, also tazkiyah.

209
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,500
Tazkiyah, there's a physical washing in this religion,

210
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,800
which is seen,

211
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
and there's a spiritual washing, which is unseen, right?

212
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,100
So all these terms are now tying in with each other.

213
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,500
Fa yunab bi'ukum bima kuntum ta'maloon.

214
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Then he shall inform you of what you used to do.

215
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,900
Again, coming back to the actions.

216
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,500
First it was what you prioritized.

217
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,400
What you prioritized.

218
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,900
Then he says,

219
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,900
what you used to do,

220
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,400
the things you were up to,

221
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,300
your actions are all going to be laid out in front of you.

222
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,400
So in other words,

223
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,100
Allah is now interested,

224
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,900
not just in our claim to our faith.

225
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,000
He wants to see where our actions are.

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,800
You know, put your actions where your mouth is.

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,400
Not just put your money where your mouth is, right?

228
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Fa yunab bi'ukum bima kuntum ta'maloon.

229
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,300
And then lastly, just a quick comment about amal.

230
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,200
Amal means to do something.

231
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,700
And fi'il also means to do something.

232
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,500
But when you do something without thinking about it,

233
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,900
it's a fi'il.

234
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,100
So any action can be a fi'il.

235
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,500
Breathing right now for me is a fi'il.

236
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,200
When I open my eyes and I see you guys,

237
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
that's a fi'il.

238
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,100
But if I choose one person to stare at,

239
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,800
then that would be a amal,

240
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
because it's a conscious act.

241
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
So amal includes intent.

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
Fi'il does not include intent necessarily,

243
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,500
but amal absolutely includes intent.

244
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,400
So Allah is saying,

245
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,800
He will inform you of the things you did intently,

246
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
knowingly, consciously, okay?

247
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,700
Now we're coming to the most exciting part before the break.

248
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,500
I need five minutes guys, okay?

249
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Five minutes, insha'Allah, okay?

250
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,300
We've done, we finished two sections of the Surah today.

251
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,400
And I'm going to give you a review of section one.

252
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,800
Section one was like this.

253
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
Everything in the skies in the earth does to speed.

254
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,700
You sabbi'ulillahi maafi al-samawati wa maafi al-arad.

255
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,200
You remember that?

256
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,900
Then he was the king, al-malik, then al-Quddus,

257
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,400
then al-Azeez, then al-Hakeem.

258
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,800
Then Allah said,

259
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,500
He sent a messenger among the unlettered,

260
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,600
who was the Ba'atha fi'l ummiyina rasoolam minhum.

261
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,500
Yeah?

262
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,200
Then he said,

263
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
Yatlu alayhi ma'yatihi, the signs,

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,100
wa yuzakkihim,

265
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,900
it purifies them,

266
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,800
you can see the connection, right?

267
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,300
Wa yu'allimuhum al-kitab,

268
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,900
which comes from the authority,

269
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,900
wa al-hikma,

270
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,300
he teaches them wisdom,

271
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,400
and finally he said,

272
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
wa inkaanoo min qabloo la fi'lalim mubeen.

273
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,800
They were utterly lost before.

274
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,900
Notice the bottom.

275
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,600
First he sent a messenger to who?

276
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,400
The ummiyine,

277
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,500
and at the end he described,

278
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,400
they were utterly lost before,

279
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,900
and then finally he ends.

280
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,000
Others will be joining,

281
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
and this is a favor from Allah.

282
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,900
Wa a'akharina minhum lamma yalhaqoobihim,

283
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,400
wa huwa al-Azeez al-Hakeem.

284
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,700
Thadika fatlullahi yubtihim yashaa, wa allahu.

285
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,500
Gul fatl al-Azeem,

286
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
notice in the beginning,

287
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
the opening, the blue,

288
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,700
and the blue at the bottom.

289
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,300
In the beginning,

290
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,500
the whole skies and the earth

291
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
are doing tashbih,

292
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,300
and by the end,

293
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,500
more of the world is doing tashbih.

294
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:19,900
Right?

295
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,300
Because the umma is increasing,

296
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,800
and tashbih is increasing.

297
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,300
This is a summary of which section?

298
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,100
The first section.

299
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,900
First four ayat.

300
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Okay.

301
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,800
We just wrapped up section two.

302
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
First thing,

303
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,800
matlul ladzina hummulu tawrata thumma lam yahmuluhaqa,

304
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,800
matlul al-himari yahmulu asfara.

305
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,000
Matlul qawmul ladzina kathabu bi aayatillah,

306
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,900
wa allahu la yahdil qawmul al-Lameen.

307
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,200
They failed to carry the burden of the Torah,

308
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
and they lied against the revelations,

309
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,400
kathabu bi aayatillah.

310
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,100
Okay.

311
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,700
Then Allah says,

312
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,900
wa allahu la yahdil qawmul al-Lameen,

313
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,500
Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.

314
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,600
Yeah?

315
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,700
Then Allah said,

316
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,100
say if you have special status with Allah,

317
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,000
what was that special status called?

318
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Awliya.

319
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,700
Yeah?

320
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,300
Quli,

321
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
yah yawladzina aduhaadu,

322
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,400
inza'antum,

323
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,300
annakum awliya,

324
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
walillahi min du'l-innas.

325
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,100
Fataman naul maul,

326
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,500
then wish for what?

327
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,600
Death. Okay.

328
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,500
Then Allah says,

329
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,900
la yataman naulahu abadam bima qaddamat adihim.

330
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
They're not going to wish for death

331
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,600
because of what their hands sent forward,

332
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,900
the priorities.

333
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,500
Then Allah says,

334
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,300
wa allahu al-Aliyum bi-l-Lameen,

335
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,400
Allah knows the wrongdoing people.

336
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,000
Then He said,

337
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,500
say death will meet you,

338
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
the one you're running from,

339
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,900
it will meet you,

340
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,200
and then Allah will inform you

341
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,300
of what you used to do.

342
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,100
Yes?

343
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,700
So this is what we went through just now.

344
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,800
Now watch.

345
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,700
Let's start over.

346
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,300
No, no, no, I went just coming.

347
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,000
What was the first thing?

348
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
You feel the burden of the Torah

349
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
and you lied against the revelations.

350
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
And the fourth item was,

351
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,700
you won't wish for death

352
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,000
because of your past actions.

353
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,300
Now what are the past actions?

354
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,100
What are the past actions?

355
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Fill the Torah

356
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,600
and lie against the revelations.

357
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
Isn't it?

358
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,300
The second thing He said was,

359
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,900
Allah doesn't guide the wrongdoing people.

360
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
And then He said,

361
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,500
Allah knows the wrongdoing people.

362
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,800
The third thing He said was,

363
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
say if you assume the status

364
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,500
with Allah, wish for death.

365
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,400
And then He says,

366
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,300
death will meet you

367
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,000
and He will tell you

368
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,800
what you actually used to do.

369
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,100
So you'll notice,

370
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,900
one in four,

371
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,600
two in five,

372
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
and three in six,

373
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,100
correspond to each other.

374
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,300
Ha, Suhal Allah.

375
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,900
So that's the first two sections of the Suha.

376
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
What I'm trying to show you

377
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
in these lectures also

378
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,300
at the end of every section,

379
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,200
I failed to do it in the last one,

380
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
is how the Quran is organized.

381
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,900
You don't sense it

382
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,800
when you're reading it.

383
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,900
You can't tell that there's actually a

384
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,300
structure to the Quran.

385
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,700
And every time I study a surah

386
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,600
and I work on a surah,

387
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,700
I also work on the structure of that surah.

388
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,900
How is Allah constructing the arguments?

389
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,200
How are they being built?

390
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,900
Do you see how 3D this is?

391
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,300
Like how are you going to,

392
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,600
can you speak like this?

393
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
The Quran was given to the Prophet S.A.W. as speech.

394
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,800
Surat al-Jum'ah was revealed at once.

395
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,400
He recited the whole surah to the Sahaba.

396
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,000
We're going to study that tomorrow.

397
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,300
When was the surah given?

398
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,900
I held back from that story

399
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
because the ayat of Jum'ah are coming.

400
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Right?

401
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,300
So that, that,

402
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,900
the whole surah given at once,

403
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,300
was it written or spoken?

404
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,000
Spoken.

405
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,100
And I have to construct a PowerPoint presentation

406
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,700
to show you how well organized the speech is.

407
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,500
How structured the speech is.

408
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,600
This is actually

409
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,200
more and more evidence

410
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,800
how the Quran is actually not spoken.

411
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,200
It is written.

412
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,500
It's written in the law,

413
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
ma'fu'l and it's spoken by the Prophet S.A.W.

414
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,100
But it's not just any speech.

415
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,200
It's the written speech of God.

416
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,100
Subhanallah.

417
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,300
Okay, let's take our break from Ahrab.

418
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,200
BarakAllahu Wali Walaikum.

419
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,900
Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.

420
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,000
Assalamu alaikum everyone.

421
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,800
There are almost 50,000 students around the world

422
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,000
that are interested on top of the students we have

423
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,200
in studying the Quran and its meanings

424
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,900
and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.

425
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,200
And they need sponsorships,

426
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,400
which is not very expensive.

427
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,300
So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV,

428
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,100
please do so and visit our sponsorship page.

429
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,300
I appreciate it so much.

430
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,000
And pray that Allah gives our mission success

431
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran

432
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
and the beauty of it the world over.
