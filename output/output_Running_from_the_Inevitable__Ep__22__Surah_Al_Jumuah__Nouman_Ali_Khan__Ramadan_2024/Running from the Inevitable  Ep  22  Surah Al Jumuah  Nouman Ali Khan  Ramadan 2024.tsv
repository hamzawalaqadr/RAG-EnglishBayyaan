0	2260	You will be returned to Allah.
2260	4200	Thumma tur ad-duna ilallah.
4200	5320	Make sense?
5320	6820	Allah chose to say,
6820	9860	you will be returned to the one who knows the unseen and the seen.
9860	12060	What does that have to do with this conversation?
12060	13540	What it has to do with is,
13540	17860	people that look religious on the outside,
17860	22700	but don't actually have faith on the inside affecting their hearts.
22700	27700	The Death Which You Are Running From
27700	31200	So, the death which you are running from,
31200	34400	fa innahum mulaqi kum, it is going to meet you.
34400	37600	Thumma tur ad-duna ila alim il-gaybi wa shahada.
37600	43400	Then you will be returned back to the knower of the unseen and the seen.
43400	45700	Fa yunabbiyukum bima kuntum ta'maloon,
45700	48200	then he will inform you of what you used to do.
48200	50800	That's the last ayah for the day.
50900	54300	Separated, so farra taferuna minhu,
54300	57500	the death you are running from comes from farfara,
57500	61100	or iftarra, when you show your teeth when you're laughing.
61100	63600	And when someone moves in a quick fashion,
63600	65700	when your mouth moves, you'll be like,
65700	69200	like that's farra, or iftarra.
69200	72700	Farfara al-ba'een, when a camel shakes its body,
72700	75600	al-mafar means a place to flee or run away from.
75600	77800	Actually, the wise meaning is not that important.
77800	81100	A well-fed lamb, wow, that's a really well-fed lamb.
81100	84700	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
84700	87500	I think it's called that because it's fur shakes and stuff,
87500	88900	because it's so fat.
88900	92900	But anyway, so the idea of farra is something that moves quickly.
92900	96000	Like quick running, quick dashing.
96000	100800	Escaping also is farar, farrat bin qaswara.
100800	102900	Right? Donkeys or mules are there,
102900	106500	and they see a lion coming and the donkeys run, dash for it.
106500	108200	That's the word farra also.
108200	110700	Allah says, tell them, say this,
110700	115100	no doubt about it, the death which you are running away from.
115100	117500	How can somebody run away from death?
117500	119000	They're not running away from death.
119000	121800	They're running away from the conversation about death.
121800	124100	They're running away from the preparation of death.
124100	127900	They're running away from facing the fact of death.
127900	129900	They're running away from that.
129900	132400	Allah says, you can run from that all you want.
132500	134600	Fa innahu mulaqikum.
134600	137800	Then no doubt about it, it is going to meet you.
137800	139200	Arabic students will notice here,
139200	142500	mulaqikum is a mulaaf and mulaafi lay.
142500	144500	Laqa yulaqi l-qa'an wa mulaqatan,
144500	145900	fa hua mulaqin.
145900	149400	This is an ism fa'il from laqa, which means to meet.
149400	152600	In the Arabic language, when an ism fa'il, mulaq,
152600	155100	or mulaqi, is used as a mulaaf,
155100	158200	it means it's already happened.
158200	162300	So, innahu mulaqin iyakum.
162300	164700	That would mean it will meet you.
164700	168900	Mulaqiikum actually means it's already met you.
168900	170700	It's as good as already done.
170700	172900	It's guaranteed.
172900	176000	You have to think of it as immediate.
176000	177800	It's already passed.
177800	179900	You know, the difference between
179900	183000	he is going to help him
183000	185700	as opposed to he is his helper.
185700	189200	When you say he's his helper, the help is already done.
189200	191500	If I say he's going to teach him,
191500	192600	the teaching hasn't happened yet.
192600	194400	But if I say he's his teacher,
194400	197300	the teaching is already happening.
197300	199300	It is your meter.
199300	201100	Not going to meet you,
201100	204200	literally says meter, but what's meant to say is,
204200	205400	it's going to meet you.
205400	206800	But the language used is,
206800	209300	it's considerate done.
209300	210700	Considerate already done.
210700	213400	That's how immediate we should be thinking about death.
213400	214300	Then he says,
214300	215700	ثم تردونه,
215700	216700	ملاقيه,
216700	218100	let's look at لقيه also.
218100	221900	لقيه actually means something that's thrown in your path.
221900	224300	And لاقه means to meet someone,
224300	226900	to come into contact with someone.
226900	228200	إلقه, like you know,
228200	230500	Musa A.S. was told to throw the staff.
230500	232100	That was ألقه يا موسى.
232100	235200	So إلقه was used for that purpose.
235200	239200	So لاقه means when you just stumble upon somebody,
239200	240900	you run into somebody.
240900	242900	This is why enemy forces,
242900	244800	when they clash against each other,
244800	247100	that's actually called تلقي.
247100	249900	إذ يتلق المتلقيان also.
249900	252000	Or إلتقاء actually.
252000	255000	قد كان لكم آية ونفي في أتيني التقطة.
255000	256100	سلطة العمران,
256100	258800	when the Muslims and the enemies met on the Battle of Badr,
258800	261600	that was في أتين التقطة.
261600	266300	And similarly, when the oceans collapse into each other.
266300	269600	مرج البحريني يلتقيان from the same origin,
269600	271500	when they crash into each other.
271500	275000	So the same way, death will come crashing towards you.
275000	277000	It'll just run right into you, bump right into you.
277000	280400	It's not going to come with like a four meeting or four warning.
280400	282100	It's just going to show up.
282100	284800	ثم تردول إلى عالم الغيب والشهادة.
284800	286200	Then you will be returned.
286200	288500	Now let's focus on the word returned.
288500	290600	رد is the shortening of the chin
290600	292800	when you pull your face backwards.
292800	296500	And رد is whatever organ is shrinking.
296500	298300	رد is a camel that drinks water,
298300	299800	meaning it pulls back its udders.
299800	302900	Now the important thing is ردود الدراهم.
302900	304500	Basically, if you give somebody fake money
304500	307000	and they give it back to you, that's not real money.
307000	308800	Those are not real euros.
308800	312000	Like you just drew an E on there and give it to me.
312000	313500	Then that's مردود.
313500	316700	It's rejected because it's not of any value.
316700	319300	So there's the Arabic word for returning
319300	322000	and there's returning when you have no value.
322000	323300	Return because it's faulty.
323300	325400	Like when you somebody ships you a product on a,
325400	326500	you guys get Amazon here?
326500	327300	You got Amazon?
327300	328300	Okay.
328300	330000	Because some countries don't get Amazon, I'm so surprised.
330000	331400	Anyway, it's the jihad.
331400	332200	It's how we should be everywhere.
332200	333800	Okay, anyway.
333800	336000	So, I don't know.
336000	337300	Yeah, my weird humor.
337300	342300	Anyway, so you get a faulty product on Amazon and you return it
342300	343500	because it's faulty.
343500	346000	That product would be مردود.
346000	346900	That would be مردود.
346900	348300	That's رد.
348300	349100	Okay.
349100	351600	Allah says you will be returned,
351600	355900	meaning you are going to be returned in a faulty state.
355900	358700	These people are being told you're faulty.
358700	362800	If it was just a normal return, it would be ثم ترجعون.
362800	365600	ثم ترجعون or تعودون or تعادون.
365600	368000	Or you know, so there would be different words
368000	370200	that were or تعادون actually.
370200	374300	But here تردون means you are going to be returned back
374300	376500	as faulty as you are.
376500	378700	Meaning you're not going to come to Allah pure.
378700	381200	You're going to come to Allah impure.
381200	383000	And that's inside the word رد.
383000	384600	You know?
384600	388200	Now ثم ترجعون إلى علم الغيب والشهادتي.
388200	391800	You will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the seen.
391800	394900	Why is it important for Allah to say the knower of the unseen
394900	399100	and the seen instead of just saying you will be returned to Allah?
399100	401000	ثم ترجعون إلى الله.
401000	402200	Make sense?
402200	404800	Allah chose to say you will be returned to the one
404800	406600	who knows the unseen and the seen.
406600	408800	What does that have to do with this conversation?
408800	414500	What it has to do with is people that look religious on the outside,
414600	420400	but don't actually have faith on the inside affecting their hearts.
420400	422500	And when we go back to Allah,
422500	424900	how religious I looked on the outside,
424900	427600	how religious I sounded on the outside,
427600	429600	how religious I practiced on the outside,
429600	430900	that's all شهادة.
430900	432700	شهادة means you can see it.
432700	434100	You can see somebody praying.
434100	435600	You can see somebody giving a lecture.
435600	437500	You can see somebody reciting Quran.
437500	440100	You can see somebody dressed religiously.
440100	441900	You can see that.
441900	445200	But what you cannot see is what?
445200	449700	Somebody may be worshiping Allah in the scene,
449700	453900	but running away from death in their hearts, right?
453900	456300	Because this running from death is not a seen thing.
456300	458200	It's an unseen thing.
458200	461000	Guys, sorry for the interruption in the middle of this lecture.
461000	462100	Just before you continue,
462100	464100	I want to let you know and encourage you
464100	466200	that I want you to sign up for bayinatv.com
466200	467500	and help other sign up,
467500	469700	even sponsor students for bayinatv.com
469800	472200	so we can create worldwide communities of students
472200	474100	that are studying the meanings and the benefit
474100	475800	and the wisdom of the Quran
475800	476600	and are, insha'Allah,
476600	478100	spreading that in their own circles.
478100	479500	Thanks so much.
479500	481600	What is going to be exposed on judgment day?
481600	483800	Something that could not be exposed in this life,
483800	485100	which is the unseen.
485100	488300	So notice Allah put priority over the unseen here.
488300	488600	He said,
491100	491500	He said,
495000	497000	and also the scene.
497000	498800	All both of them together.
498900	501400	You know, this takes us back to the letter of the law
501400	503500	and the spirit of the law.
503500	504700	Kitab is seen,
504700	507500	Hikmah is the unseen spirit of it, isn't it?
507500	508800	Alimil ghaybi wa shahada.
508800	510500	Fa yunab bi'ukum bima.
510500	512100	And by the way, also tazkiyah.
512100	515500	Tazkiyah, there's a physical washing in this religion,
515500	516800	which is seen,
516800	519800	and there's a spiritual washing, which is unseen, right?
519800	522100	So all these terms are now tying in with each other.
522100	524500	Fa yunab bi'ukum bima kuntum ta'maloon.
524500	527500	Then he shall inform you of what you used to do.
527500	529900	Again, coming back to the actions.
529900	532500	First it was what you prioritized.
532500	533400	What you prioritized.
533400	533900	Then he says,
533900	534900	what you used to do,
534900	536400	the things you were up to,
536400	539300	your actions are all going to be laid out in front of you.
539300	540400	So in other words,
540400	542100	Allah is now interested,
542100	544900	not just in our claim to our faith.
544900	548000	He wants to see where our actions are.
548000	550800	You know, put your actions where your mouth is.
550800	553400	Not just put your money where your mouth is, right?
553400	555200	Fa yunab bi'ukum bima kuntum ta'maloon.
555200	558300	And then lastly, just a quick comment about amal.
558300	560200	Amal means to do something.
560200	562700	And fi'il also means to do something.
562700	564500	But when you do something without thinking about it,
564500	565900	it's a fi'il.
565900	567100	So any action can be a fi'il.
567100	569500	Breathing right now for me is a fi'il.
569500	571200	When I open my eyes and I see you guys,
571200	572200	that's a fi'il.
572200	574100	But if I choose one person to stare at,
574100	575800	then that would be a amal,
575800	577800	because it's a conscious act.
577800	580000	So amal includes intent.
580000	582800	Fi'il does not include intent necessarily,
582800	584500	but amal absolutely includes intent.
584500	585400	So Allah is saying,
585400	588800	He will inform you of the things you did intently,
588800	591200	knowingly, consciously, okay?
591200	594700	Now we're coming to the most exciting part before the break.
594700	596500	I need five minutes guys, okay?
596500	599500	Five minutes, insha'Allah, okay?
599500	603300	We've done, we finished two sections of the Surah today.
603300	606400	And I'm going to give you a review of section one.
606400	608800	Section one was like this.
608800	611200	Everything in the skies in the earth does to speed.
611200	613700	You sabbi'ulillahi maafi al-samawati wa maafi al-arad.
613700	615200	You remember that?
615200	618900	Then he was the king, al-malik, then al-Quddus,
618900	622400	then al-Azeez, then al-Hakeem.
622400	623800	Then Allah said,
623800	626500	He sent a messenger among the unlettered,
626500	629600	who was the Ba'atha fi'l ummiyina rasoolam minhum.
629600	630500	Yeah?
630500	631200	Then he said,
631200	634000	Yatlu alayhi ma'yatihi, the signs,
634000	635100	wa yuzakkihim,
635100	635900	it purifies them,
635900	637800	you can see the connection, right?
637800	639300	Wa yu'allimuhum al-kitab,
639300	640900	which comes from the authority,
640900	641900	wa al-hikma,
641900	643300	he teaches them wisdom,
643300	644400	and finally he said,
644400	647400	wa inkaanoo min qabloo la fi'lalim mubeen.
647400	649800	They were utterly lost before.
649800	650900	Notice the bottom.
650900	653600	First he sent a messenger to who?
653600	654400	The ummiyine,
654400	655500	and at the end he described,
655500	657400	they were utterly lost before,
657400	658900	and then finally he ends.
658900	660000	Others will be joining,
660000	661500	and this is a favor from Allah.
661500	663900	Wa a'akharina minhum lamma yalhaqoobihim,
663900	665400	wa huwa al-Azeez al-Hakeem.
665400	668700	Thadika fatlullahi yubtihim yashaa, wa allahu.
668700	669500	Gul fatl al-Azeem,
669500	670500	notice in the beginning,
670500	671500	the opening, the blue,
671500	672700	and the blue at the bottom.
672700	673300	In the beginning,
673300	674500	the whole skies and the earth
674500	675500	are doing tashbih,
675500	676300	and by the end,
676300	679500	more of the world is doing tashbih.
679500	679900	Right?
679900	681300	Because the umma is increasing,
681300	682800	and tashbih is increasing.
682800	685300	This is a summary of which section?
685300	686100	The first section.
686100	686900	First four ayat.
686900	687500	Okay.
687500	690800	We just wrapped up section two.
690800	691800	First thing,
691800	694800	matlul ladzina hummulu tawrata thumma lam yahmuluhaqa,
694800	697800	matlul al-himari yahmulu asfara.
697800	701000	Matlul qawmul ladzina kathabu bi aayatillah,
701100	702900	wa allahu la yahdil qawmul al-Lameen.
702900	705200	They failed to carry the burden of the Torah,
705200	707000	and they lied against the revelations,
707000	708400	kathabu bi aayatillah.
708400	709100	Okay.
709100	709700	Then Allah says,
709700	711900	wa allahu la yahdil qawmul al-Lameen,
711900	714500	Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
714500	715600	Yeah?
715600	716700	Then Allah said,
716700	719100	say if you have special status with Allah,
719100	721000	what was that special status called?
721000	722000	Awliya.
722000	722700	Yeah?
722700	723300	Quli,
723300	725300	yah yawladzina aduhaadu,
725300	726400	inza'antum,
726400	727300	annakum awliya,
727300	728300	walillahi min du'l-innas.
728300	729100	Fataman naul maul,
729100	730500	then wish for what?
730500	731600	Death. Okay.
731600	732500	Then Allah says,
732500	734900	la yataman naulahu abadam bima qaddamat adihim.
734900	735900	They're not going to wish for death
735900	737600	because of what their hands sent forward,
737600	738900	the priorities.
738900	739500	Then Allah says,
739500	741300	wa allahu al-Aliyum bi-l-Lameen,
741300	743400	Allah knows the wrongdoing people.
743400	744000	Then He said,
744000	745500	say death will meet you,
745500	746500	the one you're running from,
746500	747900	it will meet you,
747900	749200	and then Allah will inform you
749200	750300	of what you used to do.
750300	751100	Yes?
751100	752700	So this is what we went through just now.
752700	753800	Now watch.
753800	755700	Let's start over.
755700	758300	No, no, no, I went just coming.
758300	760000	What was the first thing?
760100	762100	You feel the burden of the Torah
762100	764100	and you lied against the revelations.
764100	766100	And the fourth item was,
766100	767700	you won't wish for death
767700	769000	because of your past actions.
769000	771300	Now what are the past actions?
771300	773100	What are the past actions?
773100	774100	Fill the Torah
774100	775600	and lie against the revelations.
775600	776800	Isn't it?
776800	778300	The second thing He said was,
778300	781900	Allah doesn't guide the wrongdoing people.
781900	782900	And then He said,
782900	786500	Allah knows the wrongdoing people.
786500	787800	The third thing He said was,
787800	789800	say if you assume the status
789800	792500	with Allah, wish for death.
792500	793400	And then He says,
793400	794300	death will meet you
794300	795000	and He will tell you
795000	796800	what you actually used to do.
796800	798100	So you'll notice,
798100	799900	one in four,
799900	801600	two in five,
801600	802800	and three in six,
802800	805100	correspond to each other.
805100	807300	Ha, Suhal Allah.
807300	809900	So that's the first two sections of the Suha.
809900	810900	What I'm trying to show you
810900	811900	in these lectures also
811900	813300	at the end of every section,
813300	815200	I failed to do it in the last one,
815200	818200	is how the Quran is organized.
818200	818900	You don't sense it
818900	819800	when you're reading it.
819800	821900	You can't tell that there's actually a
821900	824300	structure to the Quran.
824300	825700	And every time I study a surah
825700	826600	and I work on a surah,
826600	828700	I also work on the structure of that surah.
828700	830900	How is Allah constructing the arguments?
830900	832200	How are they being built?
832200	834900	Do you see how 3D this is?
834900	836300	Like how are you going to,
836300	838600	can you speak like this?
838600	841600	The Quran was given to the Prophet S.A.W. as speech.
841600	843800	Surat al-Jum'ah was revealed at once.
843800	845400	He recited the whole surah to the Sahaba.
845400	847000	We're going to study that tomorrow.
847000	848300	When was the surah given?
848400	849900	I held back from that story
849900	851900	because the ayat of Jum'ah are coming.
851900	852900	Right?
852900	855300	So that, that,
855300	856900	the whole surah given at once,
856900	859300	was it written or spoken?
859300	860000	Spoken.
860000	863100	And I have to construct a PowerPoint presentation
863100	866700	to show you how well organized the speech is.
866700	868500	How structured the speech is.
868500	870600	This is actually
870600	872200	more and more evidence
872200	875800	how the Quran is actually not spoken.
875800	877200	It is written.
877200	878500	It's written in the law,
878500	881500	ma'fu'l and it's spoken by the Prophet S.A.W.
881500	883100	But it's not just any speech.
883100	885200	It's the written speech of God.
885200	886100	Subhanallah.
886100	887300	Okay, let's take our break from Ahrab.
887300	888200	BarakAllahu Wali Walaikum.
888200	891900	Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.
891900	893000	Assalamu alaikum everyone.
893000	895800	There are almost 50,000 students around the world
895800	898000	that are interested on top of the students we have
898000	900200	in studying the Quran and its meanings
900200	902900	and being able to learn that and share that with family and friends.
902900	904200	And they need sponsorships,
904200	905400	which is not very expensive.
905400	908300	So if you can help sponsor students on Bayna TV,
908300	910100	please do so and visit our sponsorship page.
910100	911300	I appreciate it so much.
911300	913000	And pray that Allah gives our mission success
913000	915000	and we're able to share the meanings of the Quran
915000	916800	and the beauty of it the world over.
