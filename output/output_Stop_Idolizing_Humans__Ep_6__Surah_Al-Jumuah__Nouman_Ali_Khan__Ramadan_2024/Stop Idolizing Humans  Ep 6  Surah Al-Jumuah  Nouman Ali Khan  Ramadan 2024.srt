1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Right? So when the Quran uses this word, what I want you to know is,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,760
it's taking a word and talking about it that the average Muslim Arab can understand.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,560
But even the highest priests of this religion, or these religions, Christianity, Judaism,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,680
that have been studying the religion for decades and decades,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,520
that know the special nature of these words are like, how did he get this word?

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,320
And how did he use it in this way? Where's this coming from? Where's this knowledge?

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,760
Who's leaking our information?

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,400
Assalamu alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,640
so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayna TV. I want you to enjoy

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,080
systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end,

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,120
in brief and then in great detail. And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanatv.com.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,360
And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,040
and share that subscription with friends and family, and give it as a gift also. Thank you.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:44,480
We're going to have you back today. Inshallah, we're going to try to finish

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,640
some of the work on ayah number one and we'll get started on ayah number two. I'm pretty confident

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,160
we will not finish ayah number two today, but that's okay. These first two ayat are the heaviest

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,040
ayat of the Surah. So it's okay if we take our time there and we still have a few days to catch up

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
with the rest of the work. Anyway, so yesterday I did speak to you about the king and some of the

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,120
contemplations that we can make through the concept of kingdom and how a kingdom is known by its

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,760
markings, its signs. When you walk into a kingdom, you see a palace, you see the soldiers wearing a

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,880
certain kind of armor, you see the uniforms of its governmental employees, you see the flags of a

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,280
kingdom, you see the ships and the navy and all of that stuff of a kingdom, you see the assets of

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,640
a kingdom, the roads they've built, the infrastructure they've done, how they take care of their people,

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,680
how they engage in war, their history, all of these things are markings of a king, the identifying

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,040
markers of a kingdom and we contemplate that when we think about Allah Azza wa Jalla. Yesterday,

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,920
before I ended the lecture, I tried to tell you the connection between kingdom and power and holiness

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,000
and how in politics, religion and politics have always had this, I mean the right word to say,

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,720
they've always had an unholy marriage, right? They've had an unholy connection between them

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,200
and so even today, politicians use the religious class in many countries to gain their votes.

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
So in American politics, for example, if on a conservative party or something, a politician

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,400
wants to gain their base, they will go into a church and kiss some babies before the election,

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,680
you know, and make sure they take their pictures and talk about God and all of that, even though

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,480
they're the most anti-bible people in their lifestyle, but they will still

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,040
tout the Bible when they're trying to get their votes, right? So religion and politics have always

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,880
had this kind of a relationship. This has happened among the Israelites also. I've talked about this

36
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,480
in some detail, if you want to know more about that concept, there's actually a story in the Qur'an

37
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,360
that details this unholy alliance and how the Qur'an comments on it in such a sophisticated way,

38
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,360
it could be a PhD in political science. And that's the story of Talut and Jalut in Sulat Al-Baqarah,

39
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,600
where Allah talks about religion and politics together and how people try to manipulate religion

40
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,000
to serve political goals, right? So religion just becomes a tool in political agendas. I've had some

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
personal experiences with this too. I was in a country that shall not be named and I was giving

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,960
lectures at the university. I was giving talks at the Masjid and all that kind of stuff. All of a

43
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,360
sudden I get a call from the prime minister's office. They hit that he'd like to meet me. I'm

44
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,040
like, why does he want to meet me? And what are you going to talk about? And usually you think, oh,

45
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,920
my God, the prime minister wants to meet you. I was like, no, I know what this is. Let me just check.

46
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,520
And I had to check whether or not he's doing well in the elections, because when they're

47
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,280
because when they're politically going down, then they want to take a picture, they want to take

48
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,040
a selfie next to somebody who think will get them, make them feel a little more normal,

49
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,520
right? And they'll do these kinds of things. So, you know, these things are a reality in the world.

50
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,520
And we have to be mindful of that. And that's something Allah alludes to in Malik Al-Quddus.

51
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,160
But now let's get right to the work. The word Al-Quddus, the second name of Allah mentioned

52
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:14,000
in this ayah. Let's dig into the origin of this word. Quddus, the root theme, meaning the word,

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,200
the three letters, Qafdah, Dada, and Sin, originally have to do with purity and holiness and sanctity.

54
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,040
Quddasa means to purify. I'll show you that in the ayah of Surat Al-Baqarah. It's one of the earliest

55
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,320
words we learn about in the Quran. The angels, when Allah told them that he's going to put human

56
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
beings on the earth, they said,

57
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,400
So, they use this word to describe how they are with Allah. So, we'll get to that ayah in a second

58
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,720
to help us understand this word a little better. But its origin comes from this imagery of water

59
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,160
that can get muddy easily. And the Arabs, they would have like a trough, like a mini well kind

60
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,400
of thing, like the picture you see here. That's a water trough. And they would put stones in it

61
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,200
so it doesn't get dirty, so it doesn't get muddy underneath. And this was an old way of keeping

62
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,560
water pure but filling it up with stones. Okay? So,

63
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,600
So, it doesn't get, you know, the water doesn't get contaminated easily. Al Qadis is again,

64
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,400
it's also used because the camels have to put their head down to drink, but sometimes the water

65
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,080
level was too low. So, they would put stones in the water, so the water would rise and then the camels

66
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,560
can reach it and they can drink more comfortably. Right? That kind of stone was called Al Qadis.

67
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,080
Al Qadis is, you guys know, because back in the day, in ancient times, people didn't have like sinks

68
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
where they turn on the water and wash their hands. How did people wash their hands or wash

69
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,200
their face? They would have these bowls that you put fresh water in from the bucket and then you

70
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,920
wash your hands in that. Right? And even in some traditional families, if you go in the Middle

71
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,880
East and Asia, some other places, you sit and eat on the floor and before you eat on the floor,

72
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,760
they give you a bowl to wash your hands in and everybody washes their hands and dries over that.

73
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,040
Right? So, the sink, you don't go to the sink, the sink comes to you. Right? And that washing bowl,

74
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,680
that's actually called the Qadis in Old Arabic. The word for that is Al Qadis. So, there are other

75
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,960
vessels and buckets in Arabic that are not for washing but the one used specifically for washing,

76
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,800
that one is called Al Qadis. Okay. Now, there's Qadis, which is a sacred stone or a precious

77
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,920
stone. So, it could be like a ruby or a pearl or something like that can be called a Qadis.

78
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,600
Or sometimes people had, you know, like in different religions, they have trinkets that are sacred

79
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,840
or holy. Right? That they ascribe a lot of value to. Right? So, for example, in some Christian

80
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,640
variations, people have like crucifixes. Right? Or they have amulets and the stones or whatever.

81
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,800
Or in some other traditions, somebody can have a stone or a necklace and some, you know, saint or

82
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,000
guru or whatever cast a spell on the stone and now the stone has special powers and you will never

83
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,280
have diarrhea so long as you wear this stone, etc. So, that kind of stone is called a Qadis

84
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,920
in language, a sacred stone. Right? Similarly, jewelry was called Qudas, silver beads or trinkets.

85
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,240
Interestingly, from there, we also get the idea that the Ka'ba, one of the words, one of the names

86
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,880
for the Ka'ba before Islam was Al Qadis because it's sacred and therefore all of its stones are also

87
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,200
what? Sacred. Right? So, that's why it was called Qadis and Quran uses the word Muqaddas to describe

88
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,840
Jerusalem, Al Arda Al Muqaddasa. So, it uses the same term for, so it's the name of Allah, Qudus,

89
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,640
but now it's being used for other than Allah. It's being used for a land. Right? And at Takdis,

90
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,160
now this is what the, let's come to what the angels said to Allah.

91
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,400
Nukadisulak actually means two things. I've written them here. One of the things it means is we

92
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,680
purify ourselves for you. We purify ourselves for you. We keep ourselves pure for your worship.

93
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,280
That's what the angels said to Allah. The other meaning is we keep declaring how pure and perfect

94
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:17,200
you are. So, Takdis means two things. That's one implication. We purify ourselves for you.

95
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:26,240
And we consider you. We acknowledge you as pure. This is a name of Allah that we use. The Prophet

96
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,120
sallallahu alayhi wasallam used to use. Subhan al-malik al-Qudus, and sometimes in Ruku'a,

97
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,640
the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam sometimes would say,

98
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,480
So, it's used there. It's also used for the angel Jibril. Right? Ruh al-Qudus.

99
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Ruh al-Qudus. You'll find it in the Quran. So, what I want you to take from this so far is it seems

100
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,280
to be similar. Pure, purify. What does that have to do with the water being elevated? I'll explain

101
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,120
in a second. But it's similar to Tasbih. Because Tasbih was to make your concept of God pure.

102
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,280
And now Takdis is also having to do with Allah being pure. Right? So, what's the difference?

103
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,800
Okay, that's similar. But what makes them different? Tasbih is about anything that will be unfit for

104
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,840
Allah to say. To say about Allah. Anything unfit about Allah. Life and death, you know, or weakness

105
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,720
of any kind. Like, you know how in Surat al-Kursi, we say,

106
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,040
Right? So, drowsiness, exhaustion doesn't get to him and he never falls to sleep.

107
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,400
Right? That's it. Tasbih of Allah being forever present and ever aware. Constantly aware. That's

108
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:47,280
it. Tasbih of Allah. But Takdis is not about perfecting every quality. Takdis is about making sure

109
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,240
you don't say anything evil about Allah. So, there's a difference between saying something

110
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,600
imperfect and saying something evil. Let's take a human example first. If I say this is a really

111
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,440
good person, but they're not very healthy. Okay, they have diabetes or something. They're a good

112
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,560
person, but they have diabetes. I didn't say that they are evil, but I did say that the health-wise

113
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,840
they are not in a state of perfection. Okay, so that's kind of removing Tasbih in that sense.

114
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,600
Right? But Takdis is not about that. Takdis is about this is a good person. They're not jealous.

115
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,680
They're not angry. They're not, you know, spiteful. They're not a liar. They're not a cheater. They're

116
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,360
not greedy. I removed all these negative qualities from them. I'm considering that person Muqaddas.

117
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,680
And that's why this word, Qiddis, actually, Qiddis, important word in Arabic, was used for religious

118
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,120
leaders. Religious leaders, and saints, and things like that, they were considered what? Qiddis. And

119
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,760
this is part of the psychology of religion. In a village, if one person knows the religion more

120
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,320
than anybody else. And it doesn't even matter which religion. If it's Islam, it's Islam. If it's

121
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,560
Christianity, it's Christianity. If it's Hinduism or Buddhism or Taoism or Jainism or anyism, the guy

122
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,200
in the village or the lady in the village who knows more than everybody else, all of a sudden,

123
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,520
everybody thinks that's the best person. They are Qiddis. They are pure because then they have

124
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,640
more knowledge of the pure scripture or the pure religion. So the more knowledge you have of that,

125
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,800
the more pure you must be. Right? And do Muslims have this kind of mentality when someone knows

126
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,600
more, they must be a better person? Yeah. Does the Quran come and take a hammer and destroy that

127
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,000
mentality? Absolutely. The Quran comes along and says there were people that came before us that

128
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,160
had a lot of knowledge of the book. And Allah criticizes them more than anybody else. What's Allah

129
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,320
saying? Knowledge, having knowledge is great. But that doesn't guarantee that you are pure of your

130
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,560
flaws. Those are two separate things. You could be a terrible human being with amazing tajweed.

131
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,720
You could do that. You could be a hafid of the Quran and a horrible husband

132
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,520
or whatever. You could be both of those things. But in the eyes of the village and the eyes of

133
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:02,640
the people or the community, masha'Allah, this person, oh, you know, because we have this concept

134
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:10,320
of taqdis of people. Incidentally, taqdis is used for other than Allah, but the spih has not. The

135
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,360
spih is only for Allah. Right? So when you say someone is not a bad person in any way, they're

136
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,800
good in every way. They have no unholy qualities. Then you are considering that person muqaddas.

137
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,280
That's what you're actually doing. And Allah, the Prophet of Allah,

138
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,080
Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, told us, the ummah, he told us that we will fall into some of the same

139
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,760
traps that people before us fell into. That itabee'un nasoon al ladina min qabliku, it will end up

140
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,760
following the ways of people who came before you. And one of the things that people that came before

141
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,480
us, they did, is they considered their religious leaders perfect. They considered them perfect.

142
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,680
And so they turned them into saints. You know the concept, right? They turned them into, and what

143
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,240
that means is these saints, they had a different kind of clothing than everybody else. They walked

144
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,400
different from everybody else. And if you're hanging out with your friends, chilling, you're

145
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,200
just having lunch or whatever. And one of these saints walked in, the priest walked in, the pope

146
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,920
walked in, the holy one walked in. Everybody's like, everybody just changes because the holy one is here.

147
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,280
You understand? And what did we learn about our Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam? When he used to

148
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,480
be among the gathering of the sahaba and some new person walked in, they couldn't tell which one is

149
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,760
the Prophet. They couldn't tell. Sometimes they went to Abu Bakr and said, Ya Rasulullah, he's like,

150
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,720
No, no, no, no, that's over here. Wrong address. That's over here. So they couldn't figure out which

151
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,840
one is the Messenger Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam because he was so among the people. He wasn't

152
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,960
a special class or he didn't get treated in a special way or expect that kind of treatment in

153
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,520
a certain way. But then you have other religions where the holy one walks in and he puts his hand

154
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,720
out because you got to kiss the ring first. And you see, you know what I'm saying? And we did,

155
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
and the Prophet warned that you will follow the ways of the people before you. And some people

156
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,960
within this Ummah developed this kind of thinking and they developed this kind of saint class of

157
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:12,320
people. Right? And what's amazing about them is if a group among them declares one person a saint

158
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,840
and another group declares somebody else a saint, this group says your saint is shaitan and this one

159
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:25,520
group says your saint is shaitan. Okay? So not only do they make their own saints, but everybody

160
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,880
else is the devil. And the only thing you're not is human now. Either saints or devils,

161
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,920
which are no longer humans. Right? And then this mentality is so problematic because then

162
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:45,440
when you put your leaders or your teachers in this position, then they're human in the end.

163
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Two things will happen. One, when you keep describing people as perfect, if you keep telling

164
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,160
someone they're perfect, they're perfect, they're perfect. I'll give you a child's example. If you

165
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,480
tell a little girl when she's growing up, you're a princess, you're the most beautiful, nobody's

166
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,720
prettier than you. Everyone else is ugly, you're the best, you're the greatest. And she said,

167
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:10,160
yes I am, yes I am. And when she goes to kindergarten, or kindergarten, she goes there,

168
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,960
she's going to walk in and say that princess is here. Hey, what are you doing there, ugly?

169
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,080
Show some respect. What did you do? You praised this kid so much and you elevated their ego so

170
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,760
much they actually started believing that about themselves. They started expecting royal treatment

171
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,360
and I'm giving you the example of a child, but does that even happen to human beings,

172
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,160
adults? It happens to adults. You keep telling them they're the saint, they're holy, they're this,

173
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,880
every time they walk in everybody stands up. Every time they walk in everybody stops eating.

174
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,520
Oh, can I touch your hand? Can I please, can you put your hand on my child's head? Because if you

175
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,920
put my, then he will never go bald because in my family there's a lot of baldness. Please,

176
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,920
please rub his head good because we can't afford propitia or whatever.

177
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,840
So do that. When the guy gets used to that, then he walks into a restaurant and nobody got up,

178
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,920
people kept eating their sandwich alone. So, all these people, I'm never coming back here again,

179
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,520
they have no respect for them. They have respect for them. They just, they don't play this game.

180
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,400
They're not used to this game, but this was a class that was developed and this was the

181
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,440
Muqaddas class. Now, what is daqdis in its origin? It's actually someone who's pure and has essential

182
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,240
goodness in it. Allah considers Jerusalem a place that is meant to have great goodness

183
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,840
because of the prophets that came there. Right? And it was a place where revelation kept on coming,

184
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,440
right? Until even Isa A.S. the revelation came there and so many prophets received revelation

185
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,000
there. So the place has a lot of goodness in its roots, in its soil, and the same way

186
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,120
our sacred land, Makkah, is Muqaddas because it's the place where Ibrahim A.S. built Allah's sacred

187
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,200
house and the final messenger was sent and Jibril A.S. came and brought the Quran in that region.

188
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,040
So it becomes Muqaddas, you understand? And the one who delivers this pure message

189
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:14,320
becomes the Daruha of Al-Qudus, which is Jibril A.S. So these are some of the meanings of taqdis.

190
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,760
But now let's look at the scriptures that came before us. This is a, I can't read that, so I just

191
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,480
this is a picture, but it reads Qudus Al-Ya'we, the holy to Ya'we, and inscription worn on the

192
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,400
forehead of the high priest of Israel. Meaning the Qudus is a word that was being used before,

193
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,560
you know, the Quran talked about this word. In Hebrew, it was already being used by the

194
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,680
Christians and by the Jews to describe high holiness. It's already a term associated with

195
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:51,200
them in Hebrew. The root is reflected in Phoenician, in Hebrew, in Northwest Semitic, as Qudus in Arabic,

196
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,440
in Central and South Semitic, in Akkadian texts, and in all of them the word actually means to be

197
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,160
pure. So this is a word, if there was a rabbi listening to the prophets, al-Allahumma re'lai

198
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,120
s-sa'a, or there was a priest listening to the prophets, al-Allahumma re'lai s-sa'a,

199
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,240
of Arabian background, they would immediately say that word, really? That word? Because that's

200
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,200
a very important word in their scriptures. And what I want you to understand is nowadays,

201
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,200
if I want to do this research, I can go to Wikipedia, or I can go to some biblical studies

202
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,920
website, and I can find this information, right? Back in the day, if I wanted to know what is in the

203
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,000
Bible, what words are used in the Hebrew text, what word is used in the Syriac scriptures,

204
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,360
you know, what do they have? You don't get access to that information. That is classified documents

205
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,880
that are rolled up in scrolls, and only their high priests and high rabbis have access to those

206
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,920
documents. Even the general public among the Israelites don't have access to that, just like

207
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:54,160
the archives in the Vatican, for example, that you have to have very high access in the hierarchy of

208
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,080
the church to be able to access those manuscripts. You can't just Google them, right? So when the

209
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,880
Quran uses this word, what I want you to know is it's taking a word and talking about it that the

210
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,000
average Muslim Arab can understand, but even the highest priests of this religion are these

211
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,960
religions, Christianity, Judaism, that have been studying the religion for decades and decades,

212
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,320
that know the special nature of these words, are like, how did he get this word? And how did he use

213
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,960
it in this way? Where's this coming from? Where's this knowledge? Who's leaking our information?

214
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,720
There's a WikiLeaks situation that's happening in the Quran, and this is actually a constant

215
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,400
phenomenon in the Quran. The Quran is commenting on things that actually only, the knowledge that

216
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,840
was only accessible to the highest priestly sources in previous scripture. I saw an example of this

217
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,480
in the last Surah I was teaching. I was teaching Surat al-Hadeed. In Surat al-Hadeed, Allah says

218
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,080
that, you know, like the Catholic religion, they developed the monk life, like people that lived a

219
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,960
celibate life, they didn't get married, they lived in the church, and they just remain there forever,

220
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,240
right? And this was their vow to celibacy. They take a vow, they take a promise that they're

221
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,840
going to stay that way and stay pure. Allah says about that,

222
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,640
رَحْبَانِيَةً, the monk life, ابتَدَعُوْهَا, they invented it. They created it.

223
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,440
Do you know that at the time, no Christian knew that they invented it? Nobody knew that.

224
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,440
Every Christian in the world believed that that was actually what the religion was. That's how

225
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,240
it's supposed to be. No one had the background knowledge of how this was actually a later creation.

226
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,880
This was not public information, and the Qur'an very casually says, رَحْبَانِيَةً

227
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,560
ابتَدَعُوْهَا, and they're highest priests of Allah. Hey wait, that's classified. You're not

228
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,920
supposed to know that. How do you get access to that? You know? So this is actually, you know,

229
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,120
we read these ayat quickly, but behind them is a large story, and it's actually, it's quite telling

230
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,320
how the Qur'an uses these phrases. Just some more about this background. حقَدُوش, this is their own

231
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,920
pronunciation, is one of the names of Allah in Judaism, the Holy One, similar to the Mubalaha

232
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,360
form, meaning this form we see in Arabic, being القدوس. And our grammarians noted that there

233
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,280
are no four, like the ضمَّ beginning and a شدَّ, four, there are only two words in Arabic that

234
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,640
have that, سبوح and قدوس. Those are the only two words in Arabic that have that sound like that,

235
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,080
with a ضمَّ, beginning with a ضمَّ like that and a شدَّ and then a wow. So سبوح and القدوس,

236
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,160
and those are both names only used for Allah, they're not used for anybody else. This is just to

237
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,800
show you how these words are connected to previous scripture. Now, تصوير هنطق ديس are both

238
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,880
typical Syriac Christian expressions for the glorification and sanctification of God. Now,

239
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,000
watch this, there's in red, you see that title in red, what does it say? Cave of Treasures.

240
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,040
This is one of the Syriac Christian texts, okay? And in it, they have stories of, like we have

241
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,080
stories of the prophets in the Quran, they had their stories in it. Their version of the story of

242
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,680
Adam, is very different than what we have. So I want you to know this is about their version. So just

243
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:08,080
listen to this with me. In whom? So, or of Adam, meaning the glorification تسبيح

244
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,480
and تقدوس in their scripture, these two words in Syriac, not even in Arabic, were used for Allah,

245
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,680
but they were also used for Adam. So, Allah is مقدس, Allah is قدوس and سبوح and according

246
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:30,080
to them, Adam is also سبوح and قدوس. In whom the divine image dwelt, meaning, you know how

247
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,760
the Bible says God created man in his own image. So they use that to say, well, if God created

248
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,880
man in his own image, then the human being must also have perfection inside him. He must have

249
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,920
God within him. So Adam had God within him. That's why he also has the qualities of

250
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,680
being سبوح and قدوس. This is found in the cave of treasures. Hence, gods command to the angels

251
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,800
to worship Adam. In their story, God commanded the angels not to do such that, but to what?

252
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,080
To worship Adam. And the logic behind it is, well, he has God's image in him. So it's like

253
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,640
worshiping God himself. And that's why you should bow down to him in worship. The Quran

254
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,960
corrects this by having the angels direct their تسبيح and تقديس specifically to Allah. So for

255
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,680
centuries, they believed تسبيح and تقديس belong to Allah and to Adam. But the Quran says,

256
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:30,240
so brilliantly, I am putting a Khalifa on the earth. And the angels say, are you going to put someone

257
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:37,760
who is so flawed? You know, I'm going to put someone who's going to cause corruption. He's

258
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:49,840
going to spill blood. And then what do they say? And we do تسبيح of you and we declare you pure.

259
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,440
Meaning, Allah redirects the Christian discussion on تسبيح and تقديس that was happening in

260
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,640
the region for centuries and says, no, تسبيح and تقديس does not belong to Allah and Adam.

261
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,640
It only belongs to Allah. Let me correct the story for you. This is the Quran correcting the story.

262
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,280
So as merely having angels prostrate to Adam rather than worshiping him at the same time,

263
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,720
whereas the rabbis engaged with the Christian account by saying the angels only worshiped

264
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,320
Adam by mistake. So the rabbis, the Jews and Christians follow the Old Testament.

265
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,920
Right? They follow similar beliefs, but they also disagree with each other. Now, why would the

266
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,400
Christians develop the idea that Adam has God inside him? Because eventually from the children

267
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,040
of Adam, Jesus will come and then he's going to be full on God for them. Isn't it? So they need to

268
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,200
figure a way of justifying that down the generations. The Jews want to undo that in their tradition.

269
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,560
So the rabbinic tradition says, yes, yes, yes, the angels did bow down, but they did that by mistake.

270
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,720
So the debate that was happening before Islam was one was saying they did did,

271
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,560
they did say, the Christians are saying they did say that to Adam because they worshiped Adam

272
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,720
and Allah told them to worship Adam and the the rabbis were saying, no, no, no,

273
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,520
they weren't told to worship Adam. They just, you know, they made a mistake. Angels make mistakes.

274
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,280
So they just accidentally did sajda to Adam. Okay. The Quran vindicates the angels. The Quran

275
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,080
comes and says, no, no, no, the angels didn't make a mistake. They were commanded to do sajda,

276
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,680
but not worship him. So what does the Quran do? It actually disagrees with the Christians and

277
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,000
disagrees with the Jews and finds the middle correct path and retells the story. And this is

278
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,040
really important in the Quran. You might not know this, but the Quran is telling many, many stories

279
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,560
that are in the Bible, many stories that are already in the Bible and in both Christian tradition

280
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,880
and in Jewish tradition, but the Quran is retelling them completely. So the names are the same.

281
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,000
The characters are the same, but the story has completely been restructured to bring it to its

282
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,600
original form. As if Allah is saying, you made a change here, you made a change here, you made a

283
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,240
change here, you made a change here. You know, like in movies, because you don't watch movies,

284
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,360
so this is hard for you to understand, but in movies, sometimes people write a novel and the

285
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,040
novel turns into a movie. Okay. But by the time it turns into the movie, the director makes some

286
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:21,040
creative changes to the original novel. So people who read the manga, I mean the novel, right?

287
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,880
They're like, oh, that's not what really happened. This was so much more interesting, blah, blah,

288
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,680
because there's a director's cut that's different from the original author. Well,

289
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,680
some of that happened, Allah revealed a story and then over time in the Jewish and Christian accounts,

290
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:42,000
according to the Quran, you guys made some director's cut choices. You made some edits to the story

291
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,560
and converted it to something else. And then the original story is basically gone.

292
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,280
It's basically not there anymore. And what does the Quran do? It retells the story as it was originally.

293
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,360
And it challenges both of those accounts. I'll take your question at the end, inshallah. So

294
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,440
while while Qudus is extremely common in the Hebrew Bible, Subbuh is unique to Syriac and

295
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,760
Syriac is Christian. So what I'm saying is the word Qudus and Subbuh together in this

296
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,040
ayah,

297
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,760
actually targeted in a kind of very subtle way, targeted both the Christian and the Jewish audience

298
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,160
together in just using that word. So we of course, Muslims are the main audience, but there's also

299
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,360
a secondary audience. I'm reminded of a saying in Arabic,

300
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,680
let me tell you the meaning behind that. It's kind of cool. You know, back in the day, people

301
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,200
lived in houses where they don't have a in America, we have backyards, right? And they have a fence in

302
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,080
the backyard. But in old days, people had a front porch. So you walk into the house and there's an

303
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,200
open front yard with the walls around it. And then you walk inside the house. And the cooking and

304
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,840
the hanging out and all that stuff happens in outside in the open. And the only thing separating

305
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,200
your front, this is your living room under the sky, basically. Yeah. So this living room is

306
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,200
separate from your neighbor's living room by what? Just a half wall. That's it. So if the husband and

307
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,880
wife are having an argument, who's having a great time on the other side? It's your neighbor, right?

308
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,720
So the Arabs have a saying, the husband is arguing with his wife, he's yelling at her,

309
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,040
he says, I mean you, what's my job? You can listen to neighbor.

310
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,840
Because he knows, he's like, you know, that's what she's doing. Well, what does the Quran do? The

311
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,120
Quran is talking to the Muslims sometimes, but the Quran is very aware that it's not only the

312
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,160
Muslims that are listening. Who's also listening? The Jewish and Christian neighbors, the Mushrikun,

313
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,360
the other people, they're listening also. So the Quran demonstrates an awareness of second audiences.

314
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,840
And that's why this study becomes important, right? So there's primary audience and also

315
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,560
secondary audience. Okay. Now I'm going to read through this because this was written by a couple

316
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:59,040
of colleagues of mine, Sharif Rundawa, and you know, so they've put together a small piece on how

317
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,440
the Quran tells the story. And I'm going to read through this because I think it's just really,

318
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,400
well, I tried to summarize it myself and I was butchering it, so I'm just going to read through

319
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,200
it for you. The Jewish and Christian texts discussed above from the intertext for the Quran,

320
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,440
that is they represent the stories with which the Quran engages when it tells its own authoritative

321
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,040
account. In doing this, the Quran affirms and rejects elements from both the Christian and Jewish

322
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,880
renditions in a manner that expresses its own distinctive theological outlook, correcting

323
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,280
their excesses with surgical precision, unless correcting both surgically. It's not rejecting

324
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,280
all of this or rejecting all of that. A slice of this is taken out, a slice of this is taken out.

325
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,280
Now we're back to the original. For example, in agreement with the Christian narrative

326
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,000
and against the Jewish narrative, the Quran accepts that the angels prostrated to Adam at Allah's

327
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,120
command, at God's command. However, in agreement with the Jewish narrative and against the Christian

328
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,200
narrative, the Quran maintains that Adam merely had a role of vice-jairan or Khalifa, right, appointed

329
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,560
by God, a governor appointed by God, and not that God's divinity dwelled in him. Who believed that

330
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,280
God's divinity dwells inside Adam? The Christians did. And the Quran is saying, no, he's just a

331
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,120
Accordingly, the Quran only describes the angels as prostrating to Adam, but not

332
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,120
worshipping him. Moreover, whereas the Christian account speaks of Adam's divine glory, they

333
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,360
use the word tashbuhtha, which is similar to what? Tashbih. It's a Syriac word, similar to tashbih,

334
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,600
and states that the angels sanctified him, Mqaddifin, which is similar to what?

335
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,160
Mqaddas? The Quran depicts the angels as declaring to God,

336
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,760
We glorify you, Nusabihubi Hamdika, with praise and sanctify you, Nukaddisudaka,

337
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,640
using the Arabic cognates of the Syriac terms, but applying them to God instead of Adam. Meaning,

338
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,280
the Quran used the Arabic words that were very close to a foreign language to Syriac,

339
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,440
which the Christians were familiar with, to actually secondarily even target them. These

340
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,480
words, you use them incorrectly. The Quran therefore safeguards God's exclusive divinity

341
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,080
against the Christian account and upholds Adam's exalted but non-divine status as a vice-genant

342
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,440
of God and absolves the angels of having wrongly worshiped Adam. Additionally, the Quran's affirmation

343
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,080
of God's command to the angels to prostrate to Adam undercuts the Meccan pagan's justification

344
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:27,040
for their angel worship. Meaning, Mushrikun of Makkah used to worship who? Among the false gods,

345
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:32,320
they used to worship angels. Now in this story, Allah says the angels themselves are doing

346
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,280
Sajda, so they are not objects of worship. So now in one story, the Muslims are learning something,

347
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,840
the Christians are learning something, the Jews are learning something, and the Mushrikun are

348
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,560
learning something. One speech, multiple audiences. One speech is Subhanallah, is one of the most

349
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,600
remarkable things about the Quran. It targets multiple audiences in one shot. You know, they

350
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,760
say two birds with one stone? This is like four birds with one stone. Accordingly, the Quran presents

351
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,800
its own distinctive narrative of the story of Adam, which at the same time engages with and

352
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,960
corrects both the Jewish and Christian versions of the story in a marvelous and precise and

353
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,600
sophisticated way. Okay, so this was some things that needed to be said in regards to Al-Quddus,

354
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,640
because it has that story behind it. That's why I shared all of this with you. Now let's move on to
