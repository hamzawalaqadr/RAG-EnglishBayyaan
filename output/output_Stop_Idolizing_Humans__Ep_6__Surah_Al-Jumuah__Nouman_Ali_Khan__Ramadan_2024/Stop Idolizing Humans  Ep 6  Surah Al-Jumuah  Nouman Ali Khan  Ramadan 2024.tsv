0	3360	Right? So when the Quran uses this word, what I want you to know is,
3360	7760	it's taking a word and talking about it that the average Muslim Arab can understand.
7760	12560	But even the highest priests of this religion, or these religions, Christianity, Judaism,
12560	15680	that have been studying the religion for decades and decades,
15680	19520	that know the special nature of these words are like, how did he get this word?
20320	24320	And how did he use it in this way? Where's this coming from? Where's this knowledge?
24320	25760	Who's leaking our information?
30960	34400	Assalamu alaikum. Before you begin this video, just quickly wanted to let you know that
35040	38640	so much of the work on the Quran has been completed on Bayna TV. I want you to enjoy
38640	42080	systematically studying the Quran from the beginning all the way to the end,
42080	47120	in brief and then in great detail. And to do that, I'd like for you to sign up on bayanatv.com.
47120	51360	And once you appreciate what's going on in Bayna TV, I want you to become an ambassador for it
51360	55040	and share that subscription with friends and family, and give it as a gift also. Thank you.
90000	104480	We're going to have you back today. Inshallah, we're going to try to finish
104480	108640	some of the work on ayah number one and we'll get started on ayah number two. I'm pretty confident
108640	114160	we will not finish ayah number two today, but that's okay. These first two ayat are the heaviest
114160	119040	ayat of the Surah. So it's okay if we take our time there and we still have a few days to catch up
119040	123840	with the rest of the work. Anyway, so yesterday I did speak to you about the king and some of the
123840	129120	contemplations that we can make through the concept of kingdom and how a kingdom is known by its
129120	133760	markings, its signs. When you walk into a kingdom, you see a palace, you see the soldiers wearing a
133760	140880	certain kind of armor, you see the uniforms of its governmental employees, you see the flags of a
140880	145280	kingdom, you see the ships and the navy and all of that stuff of a kingdom, you see the assets of
145280	150640	a kingdom, the roads they've built, the infrastructure they've done, how they take care of their people,
150640	155680	how they engage in war, their history, all of these things are markings of a king, the identifying
155680	161040	markers of a kingdom and we contemplate that when we think about Allah Azza wa Jalla. Yesterday,
161040	167920	before I ended the lecture, I tried to tell you the connection between kingdom and power and holiness
168560	174000	and how in politics, religion and politics have always had this, I mean the right word to say,
174000	178720	they've always had an unholy marriage, right? They've had an unholy connection between them
178720	185200	and so even today, politicians use the religious class in many countries to gain their votes.
185760	190800	So in American politics, for example, if on a conservative party or something, a politician
190800	196400	wants to gain their base, they will go into a church and kiss some babies before the election,
196400	199680	you know, and make sure they take their pictures and talk about God and all of that, even though
200240	204480	they're the most anti-bible people in their lifestyle, but they will still
204480	209040	tout the Bible when they're trying to get their votes, right? So religion and politics have always
209040	214880	had this kind of a relationship. This has happened among the Israelites also. I've talked about this
214880	220480	in some detail, if you want to know more about that concept, there's actually a story in the Qur'an
220480	227360	that details this unholy alliance and how the Qur'an comments on it in such a sophisticated way,
227440	233360	it could be a PhD in political science. And that's the story of Talut and Jalut in Sulat Al-Baqarah,
233360	239600	where Allah talks about religion and politics together and how people try to manipulate religion
239600	246000	to serve political goals, right? So religion just becomes a tool in political agendas. I've had some
246000	254000	personal experiences with this too. I was in a country that shall not be named and I was giving
254000	258960	lectures at the university. I was giving talks at the Masjid and all that kind of stuff. All of a
258960	265360	sudden I get a call from the prime minister's office. They hit that he'd like to meet me. I'm
265360	271040	like, why does he want to meet me? And what are you going to talk about? And usually you think, oh,
271040	275920	my God, the prime minister wants to meet you. I was like, no, I know what this is. Let me just check.
275920	281520	And I had to check whether or not he's doing well in the elections, because when they're
282080	285280	because when they're politically going down, then they want to take a picture, they want to take
285280	291040	a selfie next to somebody who think will get them, make them feel a little more normal,
291760	297520	right? And they'll do these kinds of things. So, you know, these things are a reality in the world.
297520	301520	And we have to be mindful of that. And that's something Allah alludes to in Malik Al-Quddus.
301520	306160	But now let's get right to the work. The word Al-Quddus, the second name of Allah mentioned
306160	314000	in this ayah. Let's dig into the origin of this word. Quddus, the root theme, meaning the word,
314000	319200	the three letters, Qafdah, Dada, and Sin, originally have to do with purity and holiness and sanctity.
319200	325040	Quddasa means to purify. I'll show you that in the ayah of Surat Al-Baqarah. It's one of the earliest
325040	330320	words we learn about in the Quran. The angels, when Allah told them that he's going to put human
330320	332320	beings on the earth, they said,
335600	340400	So, they use this word to describe how they are with Allah. So, we'll get to that ayah in a second
340400	346720	to help us understand this word a little better. But its origin comes from this imagery of water
346720	352160	that can get muddy easily. And the Arabs, they would have like a trough, like a mini well kind
352160	356400	of thing, like the picture you see here. That's a water trough. And they would put stones in it
356480	361200	so it doesn't get dirty, so it doesn't get muddy underneath. And this was an old way of keeping
361200	364560	water pure but filling it up with stones. Okay? So,
368640	373600	So, it doesn't get, you know, the water doesn't get contaminated easily. Al Qadis is again,
373600	378400	it's also used because the camels have to put their head down to drink, but sometimes the water
378400	384080	level was too low. So, they would put stones in the water, so the water would rise and then the camels
384080	388560	can reach it and they can drink more comfortably. Right? That kind of stone was called Al Qadis.
389280	396080	Al Qadis is, you guys know, because back in the day, in ancient times, people didn't have like sinks
396080	399840	where they turn on the water and wash their hands. How did people wash their hands or wash
399840	405200	their face? They would have these bowls that you put fresh water in from the bucket and then you
405200	409920	wash your hands in that. Right? And even in some traditional families, if you go in the Middle
409920	414880	East and Asia, some other places, you sit and eat on the floor and before you eat on the floor,
414880	419760	they give you a bowl to wash your hands in and everybody washes their hands and dries over that.
419760	425040	Right? So, the sink, you don't go to the sink, the sink comes to you. Right? And that washing bowl,
425040	429680	that's actually called the Qadis in Old Arabic. The word for that is Al Qadis. So, there are other
429680	434960	vessels and buckets in Arabic that are not for washing but the one used specifically for washing,
434960	442800	that one is called Al Qadis. Okay. Now, there's Qadis, which is a sacred stone or a precious
442800	447920	stone. So, it could be like a ruby or a pearl or something like that can be called a Qadis.
447920	453600	Or sometimes people had, you know, like in different religions, they have trinkets that are sacred
454320	461840	or holy. Right? That they ascribe a lot of value to. Right? So, for example, in some Christian
461840	468640	variations, people have like crucifixes. Right? Or they have amulets and the stones or whatever.
468640	474800	Or in some other traditions, somebody can have a stone or a necklace and some, you know, saint or
474800	480000	guru or whatever cast a spell on the stone and now the stone has special powers and you will never
480000	485280	have diarrhea so long as you wear this stone, etc. So, that kind of stone is called a Qadis
485360	491920	in language, a sacred stone. Right? Similarly, jewelry was called Qudas, silver beads or trinkets.
492960	498240	Interestingly, from there, we also get the idea that the Ka'ba, one of the words, one of the names
498240	504880	for the Ka'ba before Islam was Al Qadis because it's sacred and therefore all of its stones are also
504880	511200	what? Sacred. Right? So, that's why it was called Qadis and Quran uses the word Muqaddas to describe
511280	517840	Jerusalem, Al Arda Al Muqaddasa. So, it uses the same term for, so it's the name of Allah, Qudus,
517840	524640	but now it's being used for other than Allah. It's being used for a land. Right? And at Takdis,
524640	528160	now this is what the, let's come to what the angels said to Allah.
531840	536400	Nukadisulak actually means two things. I've written them here. One of the things it means is we
536480	543680	purify ourselves for you. We purify ourselves for you. We keep ourselves pure for your worship.
543680	549280	That's what the angels said to Allah. The other meaning is we keep declaring how pure and perfect
549280	557200	you are. So, Takdis means two things. That's one implication. We purify ourselves for you.
557280	566240	And we consider you. We acknowledge you as pure. This is a name of Allah that we use. The Prophet
566240	573120	sallallahu alayhi wasallam used to use. Subhan al-malik al-Qudus, and sometimes in Ruku'a,
573120	574640	the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam sometimes would say,
577760	582480	So, it's used there. It's also used for the angel Jibril. Right? Ruh al-Qudus.
582880	590080	Ruh al-Qudus. You'll find it in the Quran. So, what I want you to take from this so far is it seems
590080	595280	to be similar. Pure, purify. What does that have to do with the water being elevated? I'll explain
595280	601120	in a second. But it's similar to Tasbih. Because Tasbih was to make your concept of God pure.
601920	607280	And now Takdis is also having to do with Allah being pure. Right? So, what's the difference?
607360	614800	Okay, that's similar. But what makes them different? Tasbih is about anything that will be unfit for
614800	621840	Allah to say. To say about Allah. Anything unfit about Allah. Life and death, you know, or weakness
621840	624720	of any kind. Like, you know how in Surat al-Kursi, we say,
627120	633040	Right? So, drowsiness, exhaustion doesn't get to him and he never falls to sleep.
633760	640400	Right? That's it. Tasbih of Allah being forever present and ever aware. Constantly aware. That's
640400	647280	it. Tasbih of Allah. But Takdis is not about perfecting every quality. Takdis is about making sure
647280	652240	you don't say anything evil about Allah. So, there's a difference between saying something
652240	657600	imperfect and saying something evil. Let's take a human example first. If I say this is a really
657600	663440	good person, but they're not very healthy. Okay, they have diabetes or something. They're a good
663440	668560	person, but they have diabetes. I didn't say that they are evil, but I did say that the health-wise
668560	673840	they are not in a state of perfection. Okay, so that's kind of removing Tasbih in that sense.
674400	679600	Right? But Takdis is not about that. Takdis is about this is a good person. They're not jealous.
679600	683680	They're not angry. They're not, you know, spiteful. They're not a liar. They're not a cheater. They're
683680	689360	not greedy. I removed all these negative qualities from them. I'm considering that person Muqaddas.
689360	695680	And that's why this word, Qiddis, actually, Qiddis, important word in Arabic, was used for religious
695680	701120	leaders. Religious leaders, and saints, and things like that, they were considered what? Qiddis. And
701120	705760	this is part of the psychology of religion. In a village, if one person knows the religion more
705760	710320	than anybody else. And it doesn't even matter which religion. If it's Islam, it's Islam. If it's
710320	716560	Christianity, it's Christianity. If it's Hinduism or Buddhism or Taoism or Jainism or anyism, the guy
716560	721200	in the village or the lady in the village who knows more than everybody else, all of a sudden,
721200	727520	everybody thinks that's the best person. They are Qiddis. They are pure because then they have
727520	732640	more knowledge of the pure scripture or the pure religion. So the more knowledge you have of that,
732640	738800	the more pure you must be. Right? And do Muslims have this kind of mentality when someone knows
738800	743600	more, they must be a better person? Yeah. Does the Quran come and take a hammer and destroy that
743600	748000	mentality? Absolutely. The Quran comes along and says there were people that came before us that
748000	754160	had a lot of knowledge of the book. And Allah criticizes them more than anybody else. What's Allah
754160	760320	saying? Knowledge, having knowledge is great. But that doesn't guarantee that you are pure of your
760320	766560	flaws. Those are two separate things. You could be a terrible human being with amazing tajweed.
766640	770720	You could do that. You could be a hafid of the Quran and a horrible husband
771360	775520	or whatever. You could be both of those things. But in the eyes of the village and the eyes of
775520	782640	the people or the community, masha'Allah, this person, oh, you know, because we have this concept
782640	790320	of taqdis of people. Incidentally, taqdis is used for other than Allah, but the spih has not. The
790320	795360	spih is only for Allah. Right? So when you say someone is not a bad person in any way, they're
795360	800800	good in every way. They have no unholy qualities. Then you are considering that person muqaddas.
801600	807280	That's what you're actually doing. And Allah, the Prophet of Allah,
807280	812080	Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, told us, the ummah, he told us that we will fall into some of the same
812080	817760	traps that people before us fell into. That itabee'un nasoon al ladina min qabliku, it will end up
817760	821760	following the ways of people who came before you. And one of the things that people that came before
821760	828480	us, they did, is they considered their religious leaders perfect. They considered them perfect.
829280	833680	And so they turned them into saints. You know the concept, right? They turned them into, and what
833680	838240	that means is these saints, they had a different kind of clothing than everybody else. They walked
838240	842400	different from everybody else. And if you're hanging out with your friends, chilling, you're
842400	847200	just having lunch or whatever. And one of these saints walked in, the priest walked in, the pope
847200	853920	walked in, the holy one walked in. Everybody's like, everybody just changes because the holy one is here.
853920	859280	You understand? And what did we learn about our Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam? When he used to
859280	864480	be among the gathering of the sahaba and some new person walked in, they couldn't tell which one is
864480	869760	the Prophet. They couldn't tell. Sometimes they went to Abu Bakr and said, Ya Rasulullah, he's like,
869760	874720	No, no, no, no, that's over here. Wrong address. That's over here. So they couldn't figure out which
874720	879840	one is the Messenger Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam because he was so among the people. He wasn't
879840	884960	a special class or he didn't get treated in a special way or expect that kind of treatment in
884960	889520	a certain way. But then you have other religions where the holy one walks in and he puts his hand
889520	894720	out because you got to kiss the ring first. And you see, you know what I'm saying? And we did,
894720	898800	and the Prophet warned that you will follow the ways of the people before you. And some people
898800	904960	within this Ummah developed this kind of thinking and they developed this kind of saint class of
904960	912320	people. Right? And what's amazing about them is if a group among them declares one person a saint
912320	917840	and another group declares somebody else a saint, this group says your saint is shaitan and this one
917840	925520	group says your saint is shaitan. Okay? So not only do they make their own saints, but everybody
925520	930880	else is the devil. And the only thing you're not is human now. Either saints or devils,
930880	935920	which are no longer humans. Right? And then this mentality is so problematic because then
936960	945440	when you put your leaders or your teachers in this position, then they're human in the end.
946480	950480	Two things will happen. One, when you keep describing people as perfect, if you keep telling
950480	954160	someone they're perfect, they're perfect, they're perfect. I'll give you a child's example. If you
954160	958480	tell a little girl when she's growing up, you're a princess, you're the most beautiful, nobody's
958480	962720	prettier than you. Everyone else is ugly, you're the best, you're the greatest. And she said,
962720	970160	yes I am, yes I am. And when she goes to kindergarten, or kindergarten, she goes there,
971920	976960	she's going to walk in and say that princess is here. Hey, what are you doing there, ugly?
977600	984080	Show some respect. What did you do? You praised this kid so much and you elevated their ego so
984080	989760	much they actually started believing that about themselves. They started expecting royal treatment
989760	993360	and I'm giving you the example of a child, but does that even happen to human beings,
993360	998160	adults? It happens to adults. You keep telling them they're the saint, they're holy, they're this,
998160	1002880	every time they walk in everybody stands up. Every time they walk in everybody stops eating.
1004880	1009520	Oh, can I touch your hand? Can I please, can you put your hand on my child's head? Because if you
1009520	1013920	put my, then he will never go bald because in my family there's a lot of baldness. Please,
1013920	1017920	please rub his head good because we can't afford propitia or whatever.
1020080	1025840	So do that. When the guy gets used to that, then he walks into a restaurant and nobody got up,
1025840	1031920	people kept eating their sandwich alone. So, all these people, I'm never coming back here again,
1031920	1037520	they have no respect for them. They have respect for them. They just, they don't play this game.
1038480	1042400	They're not used to this game, but this was a class that was developed and this was the
1042480	1049440	Muqaddas class. Now, what is daqdis in its origin? It's actually someone who's pure and has essential
1049440	1054240	goodness in it. Allah considers Jerusalem a place that is meant to have great goodness
1054800	1059840	because of the prophets that came there. Right? And it was a place where revelation kept on coming,
1060400	1065440	right? Until even Isa A.S. the revelation came there and so many prophets received revelation
1065440	1072000	there. So the place has a lot of goodness in its roots, in its soil, and the same way
1072080	1077120	our sacred land, Makkah, is Muqaddas because it's the place where Ibrahim A.S. built Allah's sacred
1077120	1083200	house and the final messenger was sent and Jibril A.S. came and brought the Quran in that region.
1083200	1087040	So it becomes Muqaddas, you understand? And the one who delivers this pure message
1087040	1094320	becomes the Daruha of Al-Qudus, which is Jibril A.S. So these are some of the meanings of taqdis.
1094320	1099760	But now let's look at the scriptures that came before us. This is a, I can't read that, so I just
1100000	1106480	this is a picture, but it reads Qudus Al-Ya'we, the holy to Ya'we, and inscription worn on the
1106480	1112400	forehead of the high priest of Israel. Meaning the Qudus is a word that was being used before,
1113200	1118560	you know, the Quran talked about this word. In Hebrew, it was already being used by the
1118560	1123680	Christians and by the Jews to describe high holiness. It's already a term associated with
1123680	1131200	them in Hebrew. The root is reflected in Phoenician, in Hebrew, in Northwest Semitic, as Qudus in Arabic,
1131200	1137440	in Central and South Semitic, in Akkadian texts, and in all of them the word actually means to be
1137440	1142160	pure. So this is a word, if there was a rabbi listening to the prophets, al-Allahumma re'lai
1142160	1145120	s-sa'a, or there was a priest listening to the prophets, al-Allahumma re'lai s-sa'a,
1145120	1150240	of Arabian background, they would immediately say that word, really? That word? Because that's
1150240	1155200	a very important word in their scriptures. And what I want you to understand is nowadays,
1155200	1159200	if I want to do this research, I can go to Wikipedia, or I can go to some biblical studies
1159200	1163920	website, and I can find this information, right? Back in the day, if I wanted to know what is in the
1163920	1170000	Bible, what words are used in the Hebrew text, what word is used in the Syriac scriptures,
1170000	1175360	you know, what do they have? You don't get access to that information. That is classified documents
1175360	1180880	that are rolled up in scrolls, and only their high priests and high rabbis have access to those
1180880	1185920	documents. Even the general public among the Israelites don't have access to that, just like
1185920	1194160	the archives in the Vatican, for example, that you have to have very high access in the hierarchy of
1194160	1200080	the church to be able to access those manuscripts. You can't just Google them, right? So when the
1200080	1204880	Quran uses this word, what I want you to know is it's taking a word and talking about it that the
1204880	1210000	average Muslim Arab can understand, but even the highest priests of this religion are these
1210000	1214960	religions, Christianity, Judaism, that have been studying the religion for decades and decades,
1214960	1220320	that know the special nature of these words, are like, how did he get this word? And how did he use
1220320	1224960	it in this way? Where's this coming from? Where's this knowledge? Who's leaking our information?
1225600	1230720	There's a WikiLeaks situation that's happening in the Quran, and this is actually a constant
1230720	1236400	phenomenon in the Quran. The Quran is commenting on things that actually only, the knowledge that
1236400	1243840	was only accessible to the highest priestly sources in previous scripture. I saw an example of this
1243840	1248480	in the last Surah I was teaching. I was teaching Surat al-Hadeed. In Surat al-Hadeed, Allah says
1248480	1254080	that, you know, like the Catholic religion, they developed the monk life, like people that lived a
1254080	1258960	celibate life, they didn't get married, they lived in the church, and they just remain there forever,
1258960	1264240	right? And this was their vow to celibacy. They take a vow, they take a promise that they're
1264240	1266840	going to stay that way and stay pure. Allah says about that,
1266840	1272640	رَحْبَانِيَةً, the monk life, ابتَدَعُوْهَا, they invented it. They created it.
1272640	1279440	Do you know that at the time, no Christian knew that they invented it? Nobody knew that.
1280080	1285440	Every Christian in the world believed that that was actually what the religion was. That's how
1285440	1292240	it's supposed to be. No one had the background knowledge of how this was actually a later creation.
1293040	1296880	This was not public information, and the Qur'an very casually says, رَحْبَانِيَةً
1297600	1302560	ابتَدَعُوْهَا, and they're highest priests of Allah. Hey wait, that's classified. You're not
1302560	1307920	supposed to know that. How do you get access to that? You know? So this is actually, you know,
1307920	1313120	we read these ayat quickly, but behind them is a large story, and it's actually, it's quite telling
1313120	1318320	how the Qur'an uses these phrases. Just some more about this background. حقَدُوش, this is their own
1318320	1323920	pronunciation, is one of the names of Allah in Judaism, the Holy One, similar to the Mubalaha
1323920	1329360	form, meaning this form we see in Arabic, being القدوس. And our grammarians noted that there
1329360	1335280	are no four, like the ضمَّ beginning and a شدَّ, four, there are only two words in Arabic that
1335280	1340640	have that, سبوح and قدوس. Those are the only two words in Arabic that have that sound like that,
1340640	1346080	with a ضمَّ, beginning with a ضمَّ like that and a شدَّ and then a wow. So سبوح and القدوس,
1346080	1350160	and those are both names only used for Allah, they're not used for anybody else. This is just to
1350160	1354800	show you how these words are connected to previous scripture. Now, تصوير هنطق ديس are both
1354800	1360880	typical Syriac Christian expressions for the glorification and sanctification of God. Now,
1360880	1366000	watch this, there's in red, you see that title in red, what does it say? Cave of Treasures.
1366080	1371040	This is one of the Syriac Christian texts, okay? And in it, they have stories of, like we have
1371040	1376080	stories of the prophets in the Quran, they had their stories in it. Their version of the story of
1376080	1381680	Adam, is very different than what we have. So I want you to know this is about their version. So just
1381680	1388080	listen to this with me. In whom? So, or of Adam, meaning the glorification تسبيح
1388080	1394480	and تقدوس in their scripture, these two words in Syriac, not even in Arabic, were used for Allah,
1394480	1401680	but they were also used for Adam. So, Allah is مقدس, Allah is قدوس and سبوح and according
1401680	1410080	to them, Adam is also سبوح and قدوس. In whom the divine image dwelt, meaning, you know how
1410080	1415760	the Bible says God created man in his own image. So they use that to say, well, if God created
1415760	1420880	man in his own image, then the human being must also have perfection inside him. He must have
1420880	1425920	God within him. So Adam had God within him. That's why he also has the qualities of
1425920	1431680	being سبوح and قدوس. This is found in the cave of treasures. Hence, gods command to the angels
1431680	1436800	to worship Adam. In their story, God commanded the angels not to do such that, but to what?
1437600	1444080	To worship Adam. And the logic behind it is, well, he has God's image in him. So it's like
1444080	1450640	worshiping God himself. And that's why you should bow down to him in worship. The Quran
1450640	1456960	corrects this by having the angels direct their تسبيح and تقديس specifically to Allah. So for
1456960	1463680	centuries, they believed تسبيح and تقديس belong to Allah and to Adam. But the Quran says,
1463680	1470240	so brilliantly, I am putting a Khalifa on the earth. And the angels say, are you going to put someone
1470240	1477760	who is so flawed? You know, I'm going to put someone who's going to cause corruption. He's
1477760	1489840	going to spill blood. And then what do they say? And we do تسبيح of you and we declare you pure.
1489840	1495440	Meaning, Allah redirects the Christian discussion on تسبيح and تقديس that was happening in
1495440	1500640	the region for centuries and says, no, تسبيح and تقديس does not belong to Allah and Adam.
1500640	1506640	It only belongs to Allah. Let me correct the story for you. This is the Quran correcting the story.
1507520	1513280	So as merely having angels prostrate to Adam rather than worshiping him at the same time,
1513280	1518720	whereas the rabbis engaged with the Christian account by saying the angels only worshiped
1518720	1522320	Adam by mistake. So the rabbis, the Jews and Christians follow the Old Testament.
1522880	1527920	Right? They follow similar beliefs, but they also disagree with each other. Now, why would the
1527920	1532400	Christians develop the idea that Adam has God inside him? Because eventually from the children
1532560	1537040	of Adam, Jesus will come and then he's going to be full on God for them. Isn't it? So they need to
1537040	1543200	figure a way of justifying that down the generations. The Jews want to undo that in their tradition.
1543200	1548560	So the rabbinic tradition says, yes, yes, yes, the angels did bow down, but they did that by mistake.
1550080	1554720	So the debate that was happening before Islam was one was saying they did did,
1554720	1558560	they did say, the Christians are saying they did say that to Adam because they worshiped Adam
1558560	1562720	and Allah told them to worship Adam and the the rabbis were saying, no, no, no,
1562720	1567520	they weren't told to worship Adam. They just, you know, they made a mistake. Angels make mistakes.
1567520	1573280	So they just accidentally did sajda to Adam. Okay. The Quran vindicates the angels. The Quran
1573280	1578080	comes and says, no, no, no, the angels didn't make a mistake. They were commanded to do sajda,
1578080	1583680	but not worship him. So what does the Quran do? It actually disagrees with the Christians and
1583680	1590000	disagrees with the Jews and finds the middle correct path and retells the story. And this is
1590000	1595040	really important in the Quran. You might not know this, but the Quran is telling many, many stories
1595040	1600560	that are in the Bible, many stories that are already in the Bible and in both Christian tradition
1600560	1606880	and in Jewish tradition, but the Quran is retelling them completely. So the names are the same.
1607520	1614000	The characters are the same, but the story has completely been restructured to bring it to its
1614000	1619600	original form. As if Allah is saying, you made a change here, you made a change here, you made a
1619600	1624240	change here, you made a change here. You know, like in movies, because you don't watch movies,
1624240	1629360	so this is hard for you to understand, but in movies, sometimes people write a novel and the
1629360	1635040	novel turns into a movie. Okay. But by the time it turns into the movie, the director makes some
1635040	1641040	creative changes to the original novel. So people who read the manga, I mean the novel, right?
1641040	1644880	They're like, oh, that's not what really happened. This was so much more interesting, blah, blah,
1644880	1649680	because there's a director's cut that's different from the original author. Well,
1649680	1655680	some of that happened, Allah revealed a story and then over time in the Jewish and Christian accounts,
1655680	1662000	according to the Quran, you guys made some director's cut choices. You made some edits to the story
1662080	1666560	and converted it to something else. And then the original story is basically gone.
1667200	1673280	It's basically not there anymore. And what does the Quran do? It retells the story as it was originally.
1673280	1677360	And it challenges both of those accounts. I'll take your question at the end, inshallah. So
1678160	1683440	while while Qudus is extremely common in the Hebrew Bible, Subbuh is unique to Syriac and
1683440	1687760	Syriac is Christian. So what I'm saying is the word Qudus and Subbuh together in this
1688000	1689040	ayah,
1692800	1697760	actually targeted in a kind of very subtle way, targeted both the Christian and the Jewish audience
1697760	1704160	together in just using that word. So we of course, Muslims are the main audience, but there's also
1704160	1707360	a secondary audience. I'm reminded of a saying in Arabic,
1709680	1713680	let me tell you the meaning behind that. It's kind of cool. You know, back in the day, people
1713680	1719200	lived in houses where they don't have a in America, we have backyards, right? And they have a fence in
1719200	1724080	the backyard. But in old days, people had a front porch. So you walk into the house and there's an
1724080	1729200	open front yard with the walls around it. And then you walk inside the house. And the cooking and
1729200	1733840	the hanging out and all that stuff happens in outside in the open. And the only thing separating
1733840	1739200	your front, this is your living room under the sky, basically. Yeah. So this living room is
1739200	1745200	separate from your neighbor's living room by what? Just a half wall. That's it. So if the husband and
1745200	1750880	wife are having an argument, who's having a great time on the other side? It's your neighbor, right?
1750880	1754720	So the Arabs have a saying, the husband is arguing with his wife, he's yelling at her,
1754720	1759040	he says, I mean you, what's my job? You can listen to neighbor.
1761600	1767840	Because he knows, he's like, you know, that's what she's doing. Well, what does the Quran do? The
1767840	1773120	Quran is talking to the Muslims sometimes, but the Quran is very aware that it's not only the
1773120	1778160	Muslims that are listening. Who's also listening? The Jewish and Christian neighbors, the Mushrikun,
1778160	1783360	the other people, they're listening also. So the Quran demonstrates an awareness of second audiences.
1784080	1787840	And that's why this study becomes important, right? So there's primary audience and also
1788400	1792560	secondary audience. Okay. Now I'm going to read through this because this was written by a couple
1792560	1799040	of colleagues of mine, Sharif Rundawa, and you know, so they've put together a small piece on how
1799040	1803440	the Quran tells the story. And I'm going to read through this because I think it's just really,
1803440	1806400	well, I tried to summarize it myself and I was butchering it, so I'm just going to read through
1806400	1811200	it for you. The Jewish and Christian texts discussed above from the intertext for the Quran,
1811200	1817440	that is they represent the stories with which the Quran engages when it tells its own authoritative
1817440	1823040	account. In doing this, the Quran affirms and rejects elements from both the Christian and Jewish
1823040	1828880	renditions in a manner that expresses its own distinctive theological outlook, correcting
1828880	1835280	their excesses with surgical precision, unless correcting both surgically. It's not rejecting
1835280	1839280	all of this or rejecting all of that. A slice of this is taken out, a slice of this is taken out.
1839280	1843280	Now we're back to the original. For example, in agreement with the Christian narrative
1843280	1848000	and against the Jewish narrative, the Quran accepts that the angels prostrated to Adam at Allah's
1848000	1853120	command, at God's command. However, in agreement with the Jewish narrative and against the Christian
1853120	1859200	narrative, the Quran maintains that Adam merely had a role of vice-jairan or Khalifa, right, appointed
1859200	1864560	by God, a governor appointed by God, and not that God's divinity dwelled in him. Who believed that
1864560	1869280	God's divinity dwells inside Adam? The Christians did. And the Quran is saying, no, he's just a
1870160	1875120	Accordingly, the Quran only describes the angels as prostrating to Adam, but not
1875760	1881120	worshipping him. Moreover, whereas the Christian account speaks of Adam's divine glory, they
1881120	1887360	use the word tashbuhtha, which is similar to what? Tashbih. It's a Syriac word, similar to tashbih,
1887360	1893600	and states that the angels sanctified him, Mqaddifin, which is similar to what?
1894320	1898160	Mqaddas? The Quran depicts the angels as declaring to God,
1898160	1903760	We glorify you, Nusabihubi Hamdika, with praise and sanctify you, Nukaddisudaka,
1903760	1908640	using the Arabic cognates of the Syriac terms, but applying them to God instead of Adam. Meaning,
1908640	1913280	the Quran used the Arabic words that were very close to a foreign language to Syriac,
1913280	1917440	which the Christians were familiar with, to actually secondarily even target them. These
1917440	1922480	words, you use them incorrectly. The Quran therefore safeguards God's exclusive divinity
1922480	1928080	against the Christian account and upholds Adam's exalted but non-divine status as a vice-genant
1928080	1933440	of God and absolves the angels of having wrongly worshiped Adam. Additionally, the Quran's affirmation
1933440	1940080	of God's command to the angels to prostrate to Adam undercuts the Meccan pagan's justification
1940080	1947040	for their angel worship. Meaning, Mushrikun of Makkah used to worship who? Among the false gods,
1947040	1952320	they used to worship angels. Now in this story, Allah says the angels themselves are doing
1952960	1959280	Sajda, so they are not objects of worship. So now in one story, the Muslims are learning something,
1959280	1963840	the Christians are learning something, the Jews are learning something, and the Mushrikun are
1963840	1968560	learning something. One speech, multiple audiences. One speech is Subhanallah, is one of the most
1968560	1973600	remarkable things about the Quran. It targets multiple audiences in one shot. You know, they
1973680	1979760	say two birds with one stone? This is like four birds with one stone. Accordingly, the Quran presents
1979760	1984800	its own distinctive narrative of the story of Adam, which at the same time engages with and
1984800	1988960	corrects both the Jewish and Christian versions of the story in a marvelous and precise and
1988960	1993600	sophisticated way. Okay, so this was some things that needed to be said in regards to Al-Quddus,
1993600	1998640	because it has that story behind it. That's why I shared all of this with you. Now let's move on to
