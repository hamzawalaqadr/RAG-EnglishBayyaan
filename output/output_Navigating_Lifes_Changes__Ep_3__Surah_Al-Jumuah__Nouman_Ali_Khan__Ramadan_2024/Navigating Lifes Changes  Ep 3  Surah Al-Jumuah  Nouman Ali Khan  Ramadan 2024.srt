1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
But then comes a much more difficult question.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,500
If creation is imperfect, by the way, am I perfect?

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,200
No, are you perfect? No.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Is anything in the world perfect actually?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
No, the only one who's perfect is who?

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,700
Is Allah. So now here's the problem, here's the philosophical problem.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,400
The problem is, if I see a beautiful painting, I say the artist is creative.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,000
But then how can I see something imperfect and then say the maker is...

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,000
Perfect.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,100
How can I see that it's perfect?

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,600
Because we're saying everything declares how perfect Allah is.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,900
But everything itself is not perfect.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,400
So how is it in evidence that the maker of it is perfect?

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
And so it's hinting at the future.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,200
There's another subtle in the surahs where the tasbih is mentioned in the future tense.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,000
Something in this surah is coming that's going to tie into the future.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Because the tasbih is also mentioned in the future.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,100
So we're going to keep an eye open for that when we study surat al-Jumrah

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,500
because the tasbih is hinting towards the future.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,100
Right? So we'll see how that manifests itself.

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,800
Now, let's talk a little bit more about how is everything doing tasbih.

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,000
I've given you the basic overview of that.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,600
Mufasirun talked about Haqiqa in the Sanu Al-Hal.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
What does that mean?

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,200
How can you say the atheist is doing tasbih?

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
How can you say that mushrik is doing tasbih?

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,000
They're not doing tasbih.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,900
How can you say the shayatina are doing tasbih?

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,100
They're not doing tasbih.

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,300
How can the Quran say whatever's in the skies and whatever's in the earth is doing tasbih

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,800
and will continue to do tasbih when the contradiction to that exists?

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,600
For everyone, for you know, believers have always been the minority.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,900
Disbelievers have always been the majority.

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,800
They do the anti-tasbih.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,100
So what does this mean?

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,900
Allah is here referring to the Sa'ad Al-Hal.

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,600
The Sa'ad Al-Hal means the way that something is.

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,800
So let me put that in the simplest way for you.

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:10,500
If you see a beautiful painting, doesn't it speak or declare the creativity of the artist?

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,300
Right?

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:17,400
If you see a marvel of engineering, isn't that a statement about their company that made it?

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,300
Right?

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,900
So your work speaks for you.

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,400
You understand that, right?

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,500
Your work speaks for you.

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,600
The amazing building speaks for the architect.

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,500
Right?

48
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,400
An amazing railroad system or highway system speaks of the government that put it together

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,500
or the engineers that put it together.

50
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Right?

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,700
Your, your, if you cook the delicious meal, it speaks of your culinary skill.

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,200
Everything Allah created speaks of his perfection.

53
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
By, you understand that analogy?

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,800
It speaks.

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
That's called the Sa'ad Al-Hal.

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,800
But then comes a much more difficult question.

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,600
If creation is imperfect, by the way, am I perfect?

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:03,900
No.

59
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,600
Are you perfect?

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,900
No.

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,300
Is anything in the world perfect actually?

62
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,500
No.

63
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,700
The only one who's perfect is who?

64
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,200
Is Allah.

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,500
So now here's the, here's the problem.

66
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,000
It's the philosophical problem.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,800
The problem is if I see a beautiful painting, I say the artist is creative.

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,100
But then how can I see something imperfect and then say the maker is perfect?

69
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,200
How can it's, how can I say that it's perfect?

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Cause we're saying everything declares how perfect Allah is, but everything itself is not perfect.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,400
So how, how is it in evidence that the maker of it is perfect?

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
This is, this is by the way, a very common atheist argument.

73
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,100
Oh, your God is so perfect.

74
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,000
Hmm.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,200
What about cockroaches?

76
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,800
What about a rash on your skin?

77
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,700
What about my cousin?

78
00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:00,500
Like a God is so perfect.

79
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:13,200
The point is actually the, the, the, I was created to live, grow and then die to have a life cycle and change by definition.

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Change actually means imperfection.

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,700
If something doesn't, the only thing that doesn't need to change is something that's already perfect.

82
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,500
If you need to make any changes to it, that means it's not already what?

83
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,700
Perfect.

84
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,200
Allah designed this universe, everything in it.

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,400
And one thing that's constant in this universe is what?

86
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
Change.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,200
Movement is changes in it.

88
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,700
The subatomic particles moving inside every, every atom are moving, which means their position is what?

89
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,500
Changing.

90
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,600
Motion is change.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,900
Energy is change.

92
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,000
All of science is the study of change.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Every science is the study of change.

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
History is the study of change.

95
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,900
Actually, that's all we study is change.

96
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,200
Life itself, life is defined by change and a cell changes.

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,700
Right?

98
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,100
Allah designed things to change, but change for a purpose.

99
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,700
The change itself is imperfect, but the purpose is perfect.

100
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
It's not the fact that things are perfect.

101
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,400
It's that they were made for a perfect reason.

102
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:33,100
I've, I was perfectly created to be born at this day of this mother in this family in this situation for these years.

103
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,300
Meet with these people.

104
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,300
The plan for all of it is what?

105
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,800
Perfect.

106
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
It's perfect.

107
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,500
In fact, that's actually the Tasbih.

108
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Everything is being done according to a plan.

109
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,300
It's the plan of Allah for everything that's actually perfect.

110
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,800
And that's the Tasbih of Allah that whatever's in the skies is doing and whatever's in the earth is doing.

111
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,300
Washam sutajri limustaqarrella.

112
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,800
The sun moves according to an exact schedule and calculation.

113
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,700
Why is Allah giving us that analogy?

114
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,100
If you realize the sun is so precise, then you will realize everything Allah does is extremely what?

115
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,600
Precise.

116
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,400
But some things, the precision is easy for you to see.

117
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,900
Other things, you can't see the precision, so you call it chaos.

118
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,300
When human beings cannot understand a pattern, they call it chaos.

119
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,700
Right?

120
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,600
And so they say, oh, the universe is in chaos.

121
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Well, Allah says, no, it's in order.

122
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,400
You just don't have the algorithm figured out.

123
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,100
It's a little more advanced for you.

124
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,700
So you call it chaos, but actually it's much bigger than you.

125
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,800
It's in the grave.

126
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,500
Okay.

127
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,900
Then there's the perfection of the argument of beauty.

128
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,000
That's a I've talked about in Sultana Hadid.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So I don't want to spend too much time on it here because we have so many other things to talk about, but I'll tell you briefly.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,900
Human beings are not created like squirrels or cats or camels or anything else.

131
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,000
We don't just survive as a species.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,700
This is not even a religious conversation.

133
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,500
This is common sense across the world.

134
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,600
Doesn't matter what religion somebody comes from.

135
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,500
Human beings pursue more than just survival.

136
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,700
Isn't that true?

137
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:18,900
I mean, people want to listen to more and more beautiful music or they want to design more and more beautiful clothes or taste more and more delicious food.

138
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,200
Or design more and more beautiful homes.

139
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,900
What is the common element between all of these things?

140
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,400
For every one of our senses, we want to pursue more and more beauty.

141
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,300
Isn't it?

142
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:40,800
In fact, even abstract beauty, people, even if it's not physical beauty, you just want to listen to some remarkable poetry or some amazing story, which is abstract beauty.

143
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
It's just in your mind.

144
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,300
But you want to hear it.

145
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,100
You want to experience it.

146
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,800
Human beings pursue beauty.

147
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,300
Do camels pursue beauty?

148
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,500
Do squirrels or cockroaches or ants or fish pursue beauty?

149
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,200
No.

150
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,900
Human beings pursue beauty in everything they do.

151
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
And then we keep pursuing this thing called perfection.

152
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,600
We're perfectionists.

153
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:12,600
We want something more and even perfectionists even down to like, if you're just a gamer sitting there playing whatever, what are you playing nowadays?

154
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,300
Last time it was Roblox.

155
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,900
Call of Duty.

156
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,700
Okay, fine.

157
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,400
Be old school.

158
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,200
That's fine.

159
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:30,500
If you're playing a video game, you know, if you're a real gamer, you got to win every medal, finish 100% of the game, do the entire, like get every upgrade.

160
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:39,000
Do all of it because you have this insatiable desire to attain perfection, to get to the most beautiful.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,100
Where do you think that thirst came from to get more and more and more or an athlete that wants to beat his own record or keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing?

162
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:56,400
Because we were originally in the company of Allah who is perfect and the most beautiful and Allah put in us because of that company, the desire for more and more and more.

163
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,500
Beautiful.

164
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,400
And so, Arthas B is actually different than that this be have everything else.

165
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,000
Allah made Arthas B even more beautiful.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,400
Isn't just that even the this be of perfection or purpose, it's that this be have the pursuit of beauty.

167
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,800
We human beings do that more than any other creature or unlike any other creature.

168
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,300
Then of course, I won't break this surprise yet, but this be in this Surah is going to have a special purpose.

169
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,600
We'll discover that as we explore this Surah, inshaAllah.

170
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,100
Just about this, I also, Allah mentioned the skies.

171
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,200
Do this be first?

172
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,100
Whatever's in the skies.

173
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,800
Does this be and whatever's in the earth?

174
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,400
Does this be?

175
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,600
Why are the skies mentioned first?

176
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
Well, they came first.

177
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
So it makes chronological sense.

178
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,600
They do a lot better to speak than us because angels, they flood the sky.

179
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,900
They do a lot better to speak than we do.

180
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,500
And there's a lot more to the skies than there is to the earth quantitatively.

181
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
It's much, much more.

182
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,300
So the greater this be has the skies and then we get to the earth.

183
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,800
The word ma is also really cool.

184
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,900
I keep translating it as whatever's in the skies and whatever's in the earth.

185
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,000
The word whatever creates, I wrote the Arabic word here at Ibrahim.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
Ibrahim means ambiguity.

187
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,400
Is that specific?

188
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,900
Is that specific?

189
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,400
And that means the way that this be happens is that specific and who's doing this be?

190
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,500
Has that been specified?

191
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,900
And you don't know someone who is rebelling against the law today might be doing to speak of Allah tomorrow.

192
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,100
You don't know.

193
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,500
You know, the Omar bin Al-Khattab that we knew before Islam and the Omar bin Al-Khattab we know after Islam

194
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,300
may be five minutes apart from each other.

195
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,100
Before lack of this be after a person of this be, right?

196
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,600
And then I wrote an Arabic comment here,

197
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:54,300
Taqdimul Jadr al-Major al-A'l-Fa'il, which actually means that it is only to Allah that everything does this be.

198
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,500
Nothing else deserves it.

199
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,700
Nothing else is that perfect.

200
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,300
What did you learn about this be so far?

201
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,000
The image, the image I want you to keep in your head, the swimmer that doesn't what?

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
That doesn't submerge.

203
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,900
That's the image.

204
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,800
Allah says,

205
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,100
sabbih, sabbih, bismi rabbika al-alim.

206
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,800
So Allah says make the names of Allah do tasbih with the name of Allah.

207
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,700
I want you to understand that concept in a simple formula.

208
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,900
We're going to see that soon.

209
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,600
One of Allah's names is al-malik.

210
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,400
What does al-malik mean?

211
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,900
Anybody?

212
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,300
Good.

213
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,000
The king.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,600
If you talk to anybody and say the king,

215
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,700
are they immediately going to think of Allah or going to think of someone else?

216
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,200
Someone else.

217
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,700
The Arabs of Arabia, when they heard king,

218
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,600
is the first thought Allah or is the first thought someone else?

219
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
Someone else.

220
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,500
The holy.

221
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,100
The holy.

222
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,400
Al-Quddus, the holy.

223
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,800
There were holy people.

224
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
There were holy saints.

225
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,500
There were holy priests.

226
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
There were holy institutions.

227
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
When you hear the word al-Quddus,

228
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,800
the first thing that comes in somebody's mind is Allah or someone else?

229
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,600
Someone else.

230
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,400
When you say al-Azeez, the authority,

231
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,500
the authority can also mean the minister, the governor.

232
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,100
Allah or someone else?

233
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Someone else?

234
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,300
Al-Hakim, the wise.

235
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,500
When you say the wise one,

236
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,000
the average human being in the world, you say,

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,800
I met, I heard the wise one.

238
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,500
I was reading, I met, you know, or I got to know the wise one.

239
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,700
Are they thinking about Allah?

240
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,500
Who's it? Must have met some old man.

241
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,200
Must have met some author.

242
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,500
You understand?

243
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,100
These words, the mind goes to someone other than Allah immediately.

244
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,900
You understand that, right?

245
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Allah chose words and Allah knows language better than we do.

246
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,100
Allah is the creator of language.

247
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,900
Allah chose words that take the mind to someone other than Allah.

248
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,700
And that's part of the formula.

249
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,200
Now I actually have to think about the king and the con,

250
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,500
what's behind king?

251
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,800
Kingdom.

252
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,300
The concept of kingdom.

253
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,900
What's behind the holy, the concept of holiness and purity?

254
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,800
What's behind the authority, the concept of power and authority?

255
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,000
What's behind the wise, the concept of wisdom?

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have to think about these concepts and how human beings show these concepts.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,100
And then I have to remove all the imperfections that human beings have per concept.

258
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,200
And once I remove all of them, the name will have Tasbih.

259
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,900
Now it's ready for Allah.

260
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,100
You understand?

261
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,700
So actually the words as we hear them are imperfect.

262
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,900
They're imperfect.

263
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,700
Now we have to do the exercise of cleaning them.

264
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,400
And what's the exercise of cleaning them called?

265
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,500
Tasbih.

266
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,300
That's the exercise.

267
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,200
So when Allah says,

268
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,400
يُسبِّعُ للهِ مَا فِي السَّمَوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ المَلِّكِ الْقُدُّوسِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَكِيمِ

269
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,300
we're gonna try to do Tasbih of each one of these names.

270
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,000
Because that's what's being demanded of us.

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You understand?

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,600
And that's how Tasbih works.

273
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,400
It's a really beautiful exercise.

274
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,500
It's a mental exercise and even a spiritual exercise that we're going to engage in.

275
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,900
So we can appreciate something really awesome about this opening ayah.

276
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,800
بارك الله وليكم السلام عليكم ورحمة الله تعالى ورحمة الله وبركاته.

277
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,200
One time I was giving a khutbah.

278
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,400
This guy got a phone call.

279
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,500
First row.

280
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,300
Okay, if you're gonna pick up your phone, at least be in the back row.

281
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,000
He's in the first row.

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,200
Hello, is everything okay?

283
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,100
Yeah.

284
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,400
How's uncle?

285
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,300
Uncle's good.

286
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,800
Yeah, over and out.

287
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,700
So I got a khutbah.

288
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,800
The guy that starts doing this and I was like in the middle of the khutbah, I was like,

289
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,500
I just stopped my khutbah.

290
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,200
I was like, this is a really interesting conversation.

291
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Let me just finish.

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So he took a full 90 seconds, finished this conversation.

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,900
I was like, is uncle okay?

294
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,700
He goes, yeah, it's okay.

295
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,800
I was like, okay.

296
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,900
I got a khutbah.
