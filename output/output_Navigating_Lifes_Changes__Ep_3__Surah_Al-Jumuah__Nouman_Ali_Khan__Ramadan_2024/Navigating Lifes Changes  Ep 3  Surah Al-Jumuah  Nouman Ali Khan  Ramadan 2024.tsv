0	4400	But then comes a much more difficult question.
4400	8500	If creation is imperfect, by the way, am I perfect?
8500	10200	No, are you perfect? No.
10200	13200	Is anything in the world perfect actually?
13200	15200	No, the only one who's perfect is who?
15200	18700	Is Allah. So now here's the problem, here's the philosophical problem.
18700	23400	The problem is, if I see a beautiful painting, I say the artist is creative.
23400	29000	But then how can I see something imperfect and then say the maker is...
29800	31000	Perfect.
31000	33100	How can I see that it's perfect?
33100	37600	Because we're saying everything declares how perfect Allah is.
37600	39900	But everything itself is not perfect.
39900	44400	So how is it in evidence that the maker of it is perfect?
48100	50100	And so it's hinting at the future.
50100	56200	There's another subtle in the surahs where the tasbih is mentioned in the future tense.
56300	62000	Something in this surah is coming that's going to tie into the future.
62000	65000	Because the tasbih is also mentioned in the future.
65000	68100	So we're going to keep an eye open for that when we study surat al-Jumrah
68100	71500	because the tasbih is hinting towards the future.
71500	74100	Right? So we'll see how that manifests itself.
74100	79800	Now, let's talk a little bit more about how is everything doing tasbih.
79800	82000	I've given you the basic overview of that.
82000	84600	Mufasirun talked about Haqiqa in the Sanu Al-Hal.
84600	85600	What does that mean?
85600	88200	How can you say the atheist is doing tasbih?
88200	90200	How can you say that mushrik is doing tasbih?
90200	92000	They're not doing tasbih.
92000	93900	How can you say the shayatina are doing tasbih?
93900	95100	They're not doing tasbih.
95100	99300	How can the Quran say whatever's in the skies and whatever's in the earth is doing tasbih
99300	103800	and will continue to do tasbih when the contradiction to that exists?
103800	106600	For everyone, for you know, believers have always been the minority.
106600	108900	Disbelievers have always been the majority.
108900	112800	They do the anti-tasbih.
112800	114100	So what does this mean?
114100	116900	Allah is here referring to the Sa'ad Al-Hal.
116900	119600	The Sa'ad Al-Hal means the way that something is.
119600	121800	So let me put that in the simplest way for you.
121800	130500	If you see a beautiful painting, doesn't it speak or declare the creativity of the artist?
130500	131300	Right?
131300	137400	If you see a marvel of engineering, isn't that a statement about their company that made it?
137400	138300	Right?
138300	140900	So your work speaks for you.
140900	142400	You understand that, right?
142400	144500	Your work speaks for you.
144500	148600	The amazing building speaks for the architect.
148600	149500	Right?
149500	156400	An amazing railroad system or highway system speaks of the government that put it together
156400	158500	or the engineers that put it together.
158500	159500	Right?
159500	165700	Your, your, if you cook the delicious meal, it speaks of your culinary skill.
165700	171200	Everything Allah created speaks of his perfection.
171200	173200	By, you understand that analogy?
173200	173800	It speaks.
173800	175600	That's called the Sa'ad Al-Hal.
175600	179800	But then comes a much more difficult question.
179800	183600	If creation is imperfect, by the way, am I perfect?
183600	183900	No.
183900	184600	Are you perfect?
184600	185900	No.
185900	188300	Is anything in the world perfect actually?
188300	188500	No.
188500	190700	The only one who's perfect is who?
190700	191200	Is Allah.
191200	192500	So now here's the, here's the problem.
192500	194000	It's the philosophical problem.
194000	199800	The problem is if I see a beautiful painting, I say the artist is creative.
199800	206100	But then how can I see something imperfect and then say the maker is perfect?
206100	208200	How can it's, how can I say that it's perfect?
208200	215000	Cause we're saying everything declares how perfect Allah is, but everything itself is not perfect.
215000	218400	So how, how is it in evidence that the maker of it is perfect?
218400	221400	This is, this is by the way, a very common atheist argument.
221400	223100	Oh, your God is so perfect.
223100	224000	Hmm.
224000	227200	What about cockroaches?
227200	229800	What about a rash on your skin?
229800	232700	What about my cousin?
232700	240500	Like a God is so perfect.
240500	253200	The point is actually the, the, the, I was created to live, grow and then die to have a life cycle and change by definition.
254200	257600	Change actually means imperfection.
257600	263700	If something doesn't, the only thing that doesn't need to change is something that's already perfect.
263700	267500	If you need to make any changes to it, that means it's not already what?
267500	268700	Perfect.
268700	272200	Allah designed this universe, everything in it.
272200	275400	And one thing that's constant in this universe is what?
275400	277000	Change.
277000	279200	Movement is changes in it.
279200	285700	The subatomic particles moving inside every, every atom are moving, which means their position is what?
285700	286500	Changing.
286500	287600	Motion is change.
287600	289900	Energy is change.
289900	293000	All of science is the study of change.
293000	294800	Every science is the study of change.
294800	296400	History is the study of change.
296400	298900	Actually, that's all we study is change.
298900	304200	Life itself, life is defined by change and a cell changes.
304200	305700	Right?
305700	312100	Allah designed things to change, but change for a purpose.
312100	317700	The change itself is imperfect, but the purpose is perfect.
317700	319700	It's not the fact that things are perfect.
319700	323400	It's that they were made for a perfect reason.
323400	333100	I've, I was perfectly created to be born at this day of this mother in this family in this situation for these years.
333100	334300	Meet with these people.
334300	337300	The plan for all of it is what?
337300	338800	Perfect.
338800	340400	It's perfect.
340400	342500	In fact, that's actually the Tasbih.
342500	346500	Everything is being done according to a plan.
346500	350300	It's the plan of Allah for everything that's actually perfect.
350300	356800	And that's the Tasbih of Allah that whatever's in the skies is doing and whatever's in the earth is doing.
356900	359300	Washam sutajri limustaqarrella.
359300	364800	The sun moves according to an exact schedule and calculation.
364800	366700	Why is Allah giving us that analogy?
366700	372100	If you realize the sun is so precise, then you will realize everything Allah does is extremely what?
372100	372600	Precise.
372600	375400	But some things, the precision is easy for you to see.
375400	378900	Other things, you can't see the precision, so you call it chaos.
378900	383300	When human beings cannot understand a pattern, they call it chaos.
383300	383700	Right?
383700	385600	And so they say, oh, the universe is in chaos.
385600	387400	Well, Allah says, no, it's in order.
387400	390400	You just don't have the algorithm figured out.
390400	392100	It's a little more advanced for you.
392100	395700	So you call it chaos, but actually it's much bigger than you.
395700	396800	It's in the grave.
396800	397500	Okay.
397500	400900	Then there's the perfection of the argument of beauty.
400900	403000	That's a I've talked about in Sultana Hadid.
403000	409000	So I don't want to spend too much time on it here because we have so many other things to talk about, but I'll tell you briefly.
409000	415900	Human beings are not created like squirrels or cats or camels or anything else.
415900	419000	We don't just survive as a species.
419000	420700	This is not even a religious conversation.
420700	422500	This is common sense across the world.
422500	424600	Doesn't matter what religion somebody comes from.
424600	427500	Human beings pursue more than just survival.
427500	429700	Isn't that true?
429700	438900	I mean, people want to listen to more and more beautiful music or they want to design more and more beautiful clothes or taste more and more delicious food.
439300	442200	Or design more and more beautiful homes.
442200	444900	What is the common element between all of these things?
444900	449400	For every one of our senses, we want to pursue more and more beauty.
449400	451300	Isn't it?
451300	460800	In fact, even abstract beauty, people, even if it's not physical beauty, you just want to listen to some remarkable poetry or some amazing story, which is abstract beauty.
460800	462800	It's just in your mind.
462800	464300	But you want to hear it.
464300	466100	You want to experience it.
466100	467800	Human beings pursue beauty.
467800	470300	Do camels pursue beauty?
470300	474500	Do squirrels or cockroaches or ants or fish pursue beauty?
474500	475200	No.
475200	477900	Human beings pursue beauty in everything they do.
477900	480900	And then we keep pursuing this thing called perfection.
480900	482600	We're perfectionists.
482600	492600	We want something more and even perfectionists even down to like, if you're just a gamer sitting there playing whatever, what are you playing nowadays?
492600	496300	Last time it was Roblox.
496300	496900	Call of Duty.
496900	497700	Okay, fine.
497700	498400	Be old school.
498400	500200	That's fine.
500200	510500	If you're playing a video game, you know, if you're a real gamer, you got to win every medal, finish 100% of the game, do the entire, like get every upgrade.
510500	519000	Do all of it because you have this insatiable desire to attain perfection, to get to the most beautiful.
519000	527100	Where do you think that thirst came from to get more and more and more or an athlete that wants to beat his own record or keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing?
527100	536400	Because we were originally in the company of Allah who is perfect and the most beautiful and Allah put in us because of that company, the desire for more and more and more.
536400	537500	Beautiful.
537500	541400	And so, Arthas B is actually different than that this be have everything else.
541400	544000	Allah made Arthas B even more beautiful.
544000	551400	Isn't just that even the this be of perfection or purpose, it's that this be have the pursuit of beauty.
551400	555800	We human beings do that more than any other creature or unlike any other creature.
555800	563300	Then of course, I won't break this surprise yet, but this be in this Surah is going to have a special purpose.
563300	566600	We'll discover that as we explore this Surah, inshaAllah.
566600	569100	Just about this, I also, Allah mentioned the skies.
569100	571200	Do this be first?
571200	573100	Whatever's in the skies.
573100	575800	Does this be and whatever's in the earth?
575800	576400	Does this be?
576400	578600	Why are the skies mentioned first?
578600	579800	Well, they came first.
579800	582600	So it makes chronological sense.
582600	588600	They do a lot better to speak than us because angels, they flood the sky.
588600	590900	They do a lot better to speak than we do.
590900	595500	And there's a lot more to the skies than there is to the earth quantitatively.
595500	596500	It's much, much more.
596500	601300	So the greater this be has the skies and then we get to the earth.
601300	603800	The word ma is also really cool.
603800	607900	I keep translating it as whatever's in the skies and whatever's in the earth.
607900	611000	The word whatever creates, I wrote the Arabic word here at Ibrahim.
611000	612500	Ibrahim means ambiguity.
612500	614400	Is that specific?
614400	615900	Is that specific?
615900	620400	And that means the way that this be happens is that specific and who's doing this be?
620400	622500	Has that been specified?
622500	627900	And you don't know someone who is rebelling against the law today might be doing to speak of Allah tomorrow.
627900	629100	You don't know.
629100	635500	You know, the Omar bin Al-Khattab that we knew before Islam and the Omar bin Al-Khattab we know after Islam
635500	638300	may be five minutes apart from each other.
638300	643100	Before lack of this be after a person of this be, right?
643100	645600	And then I wrote an Arabic comment here,
645600	654300	Taqdimul Jadr al-Major al-A'l-Fa'il, which actually means that it is only to Allah that everything does this be.
654300	656500	Nothing else deserves it.
656500	659700	Nothing else is that perfect.
659700	661300	What did you learn about this be so far?
661300	667000	The image, the image I want you to keep in your head, the swimmer that doesn't what?
667000	668200	That doesn't submerge.
668200	669900	That's the image.
669900	670800	Allah says,
670800	675100	sabbih, sabbih, bismi rabbika al-alim.
675100	681800	So Allah says make the names of Allah do tasbih with the name of Allah.
681800	685700	I want you to understand that concept in a simple formula.
685700	686900	We're going to see that soon.
686900	688600	One of Allah's names is al-malik.
688600	689400	What does al-malik mean?
689400	690900	Anybody?
690900	691300	Good.
691300	692000	The king.
692000	694600	If you talk to anybody and say the king,
694600	698700	are they immediately going to think of Allah or going to think of someone else?
698700	700200	Someone else.
700200	702700	The Arabs of Arabia, when they heard king,
702700	706600	is the first thought Allah or is the first thought someone else?
706600	708200	Someone else.
708200	709500	The holy.
709500	710100	The holy.
710100	711400	Al-Quddus, the holy.
711400	712800	There were holy people.
712800	714200	There were holy saints.
714200	715500	There were holy priests.
715500	717000	There were holy institutions.
717000	718200	When you hear the word al-Quddus,
718200	721800	the first thing that comes in somebody's mind is Allah or someone else?
721800	722600	Someone else.
722600	725400	When you say al-Azeez, the authority,
725400	729500	the authority can also mean the minister, the governor.
729500	731100	Allah or someone else?
731100	732100	Someone else?
732100	734300	Al-Hakim, the wise.
734300	736500	When you say the wise one,
736500	739000	the average human being in the world, you say,
739000	741800	I met, I heard the wise one.
741900	745500	I was reading, I met, you know, or I got to know the wise one.
745500	747700	Are they thinking about Allah?
747700	749500	Who's it? Must have met some old man.
749500	751200	Must have met some author.
751200	752500	You understand?
752500	757100	These words, the mind goes to someone other than Allah immediately.
757100	759900	You understand that, right?
759900	763900	Allah chose words and Allah knows language better than we do.
763900	765100	Allah is the creator of language.
765100	768900	Allah chose words that take the mind to someone other than Allah.
768900	770700	And that's part of the formula.
770700	774200	Now I actually have to think about the king and the con,
774200	775500	what's behind king?
775500	776800	Kingdom.
776800	778300	The concept of kingdom.
778300	781900	What's behind the holy, the concept of holiness and purity?
781900	785800	What's behind the authority, the concept of power and authority?
785800	789000	What's behind the wise, the concept of wisdom?
789000	794000	I have to think about these concepts and how human beings show these concepts.
794000	800100	And then I have to remove all the imperfections that human beings have per concept.
800200	804200	And once I remove all of them, the name will have Tasbih.
804200	806900	Now it's ready for Allah.
806900	808100	You understand?
808100	812700	So actually the words as we hear them are imperfect.
812700	813900	They're imperfect.
813900	816700	Now we have to do the exercise of cleaning them.
816700	819400	And what's the exercise of cleaning them called?
819400	820500	Tasbih.
820500	821300	That's the exercise.
821300	822200	So when Allah says,
822200	828400	يُسبِّعُ للهِ مَا فِي السَّمَوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ المَلِّكِ الْقُدُّوسِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَكِيمِ
828400	832300	we're gonna try to do Tasbih of each one of these names.
832300	834000	Because that's what's being demanded of us.
834000	835000	You understand?
835000	836600	And that's how Tasbih works.
836600	838400	It's a really beautiful exercise.
838400	842500	It's a mental exercise and even a spiritual exercise that we're going to engage in.
842500	845900	So we can appreciate something really awesome about this opening ayah.
845900	848800	بارك الله وليكم السلام عليكم ورحمة الله تعالى ورحمة الله وبركاته.
852100	853200	One time I was giving a khutbah.
853200	854400	This guy got a phone call.
854400	855500	First row.
855500	858300	Okay, if you're gonna pick up your phone, at least be in the back row.
858300	860000	He's in the first row.
860000	861200	Hello, is everything okay?
861200	862100	Yeah.
862100	863400	How's uncle?
863400	864300	Uncle's good.
864300	866800	Yeah, over and out.
866800	867700	So I got a khutbah.
867700	871800	The guy that starts doing this and I was like in the middle of the khutbah, I was like,
871800	873500	I just stopped my khutbah.
873500	875200	I was like, this is a really interesting conversation.
875200	878000	Let me just finish.
878000	881000	So he took a full 90 seconds, finished this conversation.
881000	881900	I was like, is uncle okay?
881900	882700	He goes, yeah, it's okay.
882700	883800	I was like, okay.
883800	884900	I got a khutbah.
